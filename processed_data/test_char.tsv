10 @percent of people agree that computers make life less complicated. i also agree with this. using computers teaches hand-eye coordination, gives people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and lets people talk online with other people. i think that these are all very important. why wouldn't you want to have strong hand-eye coordination? i think this a very important skill. computers help teach hand-eye coordination and they keep it strong. while you're looking at the screen your hand is moving the mouse where you want it to go. good hand-eye coordination is used for a lot of things; mostly everything. if you play some sports like baseball, hand-eye is one of the most important elements. why not make that stronger off of the feild? also, hand-eye can be used to @organization while taking notes. hand-eye is involved with almost everything you do. you can't have a poor hand-eye coordination or else you won't be able to function properly. @num out of @num doctors agree that hand-eye very important for healthy living. i love to travel, but i want to know about the place i'm going to before i get on the phone to go there.  said @person, a science teacher at @organization. he feels the way, i'm sure, a lot of people feel. they want to know about the place they are going to and they want it to be current. the computer has plenty information about a lot of different places in the world. some books don't offer as much information or they need to be updated. computers are also very good for learning about other cultures and traditions. no one wants to be ignorant right? people want to know what's going on in the world quick and easy. the computer does this. i remember when i was about @num, our phone broke in our house. we couldn't go out and get one right away either. the only way we were able to communicate with our family and friends was by computer. the computer made it easier to e-mail everyone and tell them why we weren't answering our house phone. this happens more often than you think. people need to communicate through computer a lot. at work, if you need to talk to an employee or co-worker and you can't leave your desk, you can just e-mail the information to them. @num out of @num employees say that it is much faster and easier to e-mail information as opposed to talking them on the phone or in person. a lot of people agree that computer make life a lot easier. computers teach hand-eye coordination and they let you communicate with other people. the most critical reason is that computers let people learn about faraway places and people. you can make a difference in the way people feel about computers. write to your local newspaper. it's now or never! 
8 dear @caps, @caps off, i beileve that computers are very helpfull to many people by looking up information, or talking to friends. although many kids should be spending their time outside, the computer is a well-occupied environment that helps kids learn and interact with others. i believe kids should have the right to stay on the computer as long as they desire. although, they should always make time go outside, hang out with friends, ect. the computer @month be fun but its always important to get outside and enjoy nature. another reason why students should not spend all their time on the computer is because of their health. if a child gets addicted to the computer it will affect how he interacts with other and @month do serious damage to their brain. although, i believe children should have the right on the computer, it's always important to spend time outside enjoying nature. another reason why i think children should have the right to the computer is because of the information they learn and discover. many kids grow up to have a career in computer makings or program designing. some kids @month have their education online or to teach others. the computer is a non-stop generation of intelligence based to help people learn, play and discover. many people have dream to one day build a computer or make new programs. all students should have the right to spend time on the computer but also to save time to spend outside and with friends. everyone has their own perspective on how they think and if staying on the computer all day is a good thing. i do not think kids should do this because it might affect their health and how other think of them.
8 dear newspaper people, i think that computers do benefit society for a few reasons. computers make work easier they can do things people can't like solve difficult problems, and kids like playing games on them. computers make work easier and neater. typing is often faster than writing, and is always easier to read. studies have also shown that people who use computers to do work finish faster and have up to @percent more free time to do whatever they want. computers also have e-mail, which allows you to send work that you have done to your boss without printing it and wasting paper. computers can solve difficult problems that people either can't do, or don't want to waste their time doing. if you need to solve a math problem you use a calculated or a computer. so you don't have to figure it out yourself. i have to do a lot of math problems for homework and i think it is much easier to use a calculator. my last reason why computers are good is that kids like playing games on them. a lot of people say that kids shouldn't play computer games but some of them are educational. even non-educational games help kids to have fun and have something to look forward to after their work is done. @percent of kids say that they are happier when they have something fun to look forward to, and happier kids do better work. i hope that after reading this you will understand how much computers contribute to society.
10 dear @caps @caps, have you ever wondered what effect computers have on people? it is a very negative effect. computers are one of the main reasons of why kids do not exercise and become obese, it can effect students' grades, and by being on the @caps, you are isolating yourself from your loved ones. first of all, more and more kids are using computers way more often than they should. the result of this, you @month ask? since computers are used daily, especially by young adolescents, it is likely for that child to become obese. researches from well-known colleges, such as @organization and @location, discovered that @percent of kids who spend more than two hours on the @caps are obese or will become heavier when they are older. after speaking with @person, graduate from @location, he told me that when children spend more time on the @caps, they are doing nothing but staring at a bright screen that can damage their eyes, and not spending their time outside enjoying the beautiful weather. as a consequence, kids start to gain body fat from sitting on a coach staring at the @caps all day instead of exercising! my second reason of why computers are a negative effects on kids is that it can harm your grades! after i spoke with a current student at @organization, she told me that the reason why her grades drop is because she is too busy on @caps, @caps, @caps, etc. she does not focus on her @organization work like she should and because she doesn't, her grades go from @num's to low @num's. this shows that even  a  students are getting bad grades from being on the @caps. additionally, from being on the @caps so much and not paying attention at @organization work, it can effect your best grades on the @organization's! this shows that by always going on the @caps you hurt your academic skills. my last and final reason of why computers have a negative effect on children is because it harms your social skills of being on outgoing, talkative individual! everytime you log into that death trap device, your selfesteem becomes lower because you never talk to friends or call them. you just sit on a hard chair, looking at an electronics device that is going to take you no where in life. also, you are pushing your loved ones away by being on @caps @num. you will end up never spend time with them and you will never call your friends to see what they are up to if you keep on going on the @caps. furthermore, if your mom or dad tells you to get off your @caps, you become cranky and rude to your family just becuase you want to go back on your favorite electronic device. do you really want to act that way to your family? so, in summing up, computers are a negative effect on many young individuals, and the reasons for this are that you have less time to exercise, it harms your grades, and you are not able to be as interactive with people by being on the @caps. the real question is, though, is do you think computers have a negative or positive effect on people?
11 have you ever had the time completely fly by while you're on the computer? you go on at @timepm and all of a sudden it's seven at night. people should spend less time on the computer because they should be outside, it takes away time with your family, and there are other ways to look up information. you should be outside, enjoying the fresh air and playing sports, not stuck inside all day with your eyes glued to a screen. when you're on the computer all day, you're just sitting there. you're not moving around at all. seventy-two percent of kids who spend all their time on the computer are over weight. being on the computer on a beautiful is like blocking out the birds' songs on the first day of @date. nature is amazing, and you should be outside enjoying it, not cooped up in a stuffy room leaning over a man-made machine. people should spend a lot less time on their computer. when you're on the computer, time really flies by. you lose your whole day to it, and wouldn't you rather be doing something more fun? you can be alone on the computer in a dark room. you should be with your family and and friends. computers are going to be around for a long time, and when they die down it will only be because something better came along. your baby brother won't be a baby forever and your grandparents might not even be there tomorrow. don't you want to spend as much time as you can with them? you're changing too, so you @month be off to college or have to move far away for buissness.  they grow up so fast. they're adults in a blink of an eye.  my grandma said to my mom. almost @percent of parents feel that same way. so, don't spend all your time alone with a machine, be with your loving family and chairish each moment. people should spend less time on the computer because there are other ways to look up information and learn about new places. there are so many books in the world, about any topic you can imagine. using books to look up information is better than typing in the word into google because it's important to learn how to use an index and find the book on the shelf. a trip to the library @month not be your cup of sunshine, so if you want to learn about a place, why don't you go to that place? if you're doing a report on @location for school it would be a lot of fun to go to @location for a few days to learn about it. and you can take pictures with your own camera, not just a picture you found online. it would be a really fun family trip. even if you're doing your report on a place as boring as @location, you could still probably have a lot of fun, hanging out with your family together. in conclusion, people should spend less time on the computer and more time being outside, with family, and at really fun places. why would you want to stare at a screen all day when you could be having this much fun?
9 in @date has become far more advanced. computers are one of the most futiristic objects. the computer is good for connecting to people around the world. however, computers have bad effects on people's lives. children are taking time out of their homework to go on the computer, citizens are gaining weight, and children are being kidnapped. school is very important and valuable if you want to suceed in life. however, computers have made it difficult for students to concentrat on their homework. this is a horrible habbit and a bad effect on students every where. students grades will suffer and will not obtain class credits if this problem is not mentioned. obesity is a huge problem in @location, five out of every ten @caps are either overweight or obese. this can lead to death. the problem is that people are spending hours on the computer each day. most of that time can be used to exercise. exercising can be an important benefit to someone's life. if this problem is not addressed millions of americans will be overweight, @caps is a very serious and dangerous topic. every month dozend of kids are kidnapped. since the internet was invented there is a twenty percent increase rate of kids missing children will go on poppular networking websites such as @caps, @caps, and twitter and give out their important information. pedophiles use the internet to trick children in to giving their address. this problem needs to stop and be addressed by the police. everyday, more and more people use computers. compuers have good and bad effects on peoples lives. the bad effects are very serious and dangerous. how would you feel if your child fails school, gains weight, or gets kidnapped because of the computer?
4 dear @caps, i, agree that computers are benefits society. the computers have positive effect on people like hand-eye coordination. i helps you learn about other country religios, and other thing. you can communicate, meet other people, and chat tru computers. another positive fact about computer is that you can find all the information you need and fast. in other words is that computer help a lot of people.
8 i think it is okay for people to use computers because they get to learn new things and meet new people. i don't think it's a bad idea to use computers because some people who have jobs works on computers all day. @num each sometimes computers can be a distraction but computers can help you alot. i think using computers can help you learn new things and meet new people. slick, slack, slick, thats the sound of people typing ont he computer and meeting new friends and having a good time. when you learn something new like a rat is as big as a house. you get excited and feel your the smartest person in the world. i dont think its a bad idea to use computers because some peole who have jobs work on computers all day. i think people who uses computers all day while the're at work dont have to be classy, topuler or trendy, they just working to help themselves and theior family. yeah sometimes computers can be a distraction but computers can help you alot. they can help you learn new things meet new friends and give you something to do when your bored. i remember the time when i was bored and i went on the computer to google who @person was and i found out she was a famous sinher, someone i didn't know but heard about. chantrail @caps a @num grade student says  only people who want to learn something or meet new friends will use the computers. if you want to learn something new or meet new people then i suggest you stop eating those chips, get off that couch and use the computer.
8 dear local newspaper, i think that computers have a good effect on people. they are good because you can learn things educational. you can hear the latest stories on everything, and you can keep your information down for yourself. computers are a good thing to have because you can learn information. @caps you have a question or don't know what something means, you can find out on the internet. these are some internet sources that are @num to answer questions. @caps we didnt have computers, then @caps you have a question, then you would have to go find a book to read in and that takes much more work. another reason why computers are a good things is because you can catch up on all of the recent stories. you can learn about whats happenings in other parts of the world, you can learn things about celebrities, and you can look at the weather. you can find all this cut on television, but you never knows when it would come on. with computers, you can search all the latest stories and find things cut when you want to know them. with computers, you can also keep information down. you could use @organization and keep everything you need to know in a nice and fashion. you can also make graphs on the computer. this way your graphs will nice have alright time and @caps you would to go information that in a @caps there were no computers then your information would not be as and you can it. i believe that computers are a good thing to have because you can hear about the latest stories, and you can keep your own information neat. i believe computers positive effect in people.
7 i believe that computers have good effects on people. computers allow people to stay in touch with long distance friends or family. computers have games for kids that help them learn, and, also, people learn new things, too. my first reason is that, computers allow people to stay in touch. if someone in their family live long distance then they could always use e-mails to talk. that way they wont lose each other. also, sometimes, friends move away and you always want to keep in touch. another thing is that, if they want to send photos to each other, they can use e-mail. also, because, thru an mail takes forever. please, let the people stay in touch! my second reason is that, computers has games kids play. the games kids play could help them learn more. sometimes watching t.v. don't help. if they acutually play the game and see what their doing, then they will got smarter. that's what we want for our kids, right? also, kids have fun playing these games. do you really want to take the learning experience away? my third reason is, computers help people learn new things. like, they could go on the computer and learn what's happening in the world. people can learn new words they never knew about. also, pictures on the computer help, too. for example, if someone is traveling somewhere, and they don't know how the price. they can get on the computer and check it out, right? so, in conclusion, i believe that computers are good use. they help people stay in touch, help kids learn by playing games and help people learn new things about the world and more. so, i'm saying, please, keep the computers. they are not a waste of our time. turst me!
10 computers have caused many people money, friends and time. in fact, since that the computers came out this year, lots of people has been spending web to much time of them. which can cause people to loose time and friends. computers and technology today have had a very influence on very many people. spending too much time on computers can cause to loose time and money. for example, my oldest brother was very large at the age of @num or @num because our computer started working, but this had a positive impact on him, he started participating in sports such as basketball and lacrosse and that he was very at them and followed lacrosse through highschool. while doing this he and saves my parents money. this is @caps reason how computers have had a negative effect on people. the new technology has caused people to loose lots of time when they could be doing other things that would them in life. for example, many people in the @location have half of their day to computers, and not getting the exercise of this are video games of the day on computers. this is @caps affect that computers can have on people is loosing or with friends. for example, i used to be friends a person, but then he did not talk to me for almost the entire @date because he was always on the computer, which made me think that he did not want to be friends but actually he just deleted almost all of the the @date to the computer. since this helped i have been over to his house about @num times this year as to every @date. this is @caps way computers can change your life. the time has come to decide whether to have a computer or not to have in computers. in my mind i that it would be best for everyone if we did not have the on computers, but if you do that we should have the an computers than put a certain time wait on computers. in your so you and your family members don't loose time, exercise time, or friends. overall, i think that it would be best for everyone if we had a time on computers to the whole day on them.
9 dear newspaper,  @caps no!' i forgot the deffinition to this homework problem and i don t have my notes. now, in this situation a computer would be very helpful to just type in the word and get a whole bunch of results. this is why i believe having access to a computer at all times is very helpfull because you can find information that you've been needing. you can get in touch with a friend if you need to or just to talk to lostly if you are just sitting around and having nothing to do you can just go on the computer and discover things you @month not have known. having access to a computer is a real and very helpfull because if your just having a conversation with someone and you forget a name of an important fact you want to tell them, you can always just look it up. for me, a lot of the times i just need information about maybe a sports player of facts about a famous event. since our technology is so up to date the computer is right there sitting with many of the helpfull facts we would like to know. friends are a big part of my life and i love just to talk to them and see how they are doing. again, our technology is so advanced now that there is a bunch of websites where we can talk and see how we are doing. a big reason why being able to talk to friends and family is helpful is for taking to people that are very far away and the ones you dont normally see. on a computer you can talk to people from not only all over the @caps.s.a but even in other countrys! finally, the times i find having a computer around me most helpfull is when i am just bored with nothing to do! i can just visit a whole bunch of educational websites on things i @month have learned in school or wanted to learn. on the internet there are many things to keep you occupied like games or ou can even watch movies from your home onto the computer! if you have a computer around your house you should not be bored because there is many things you can be doing or even learning! having a computer around your house is so helpfull, you can have fun but your even learning how to be good with technology at the same time. computers are the future and its a good one. so i suggest you pick one up and just have a blast, you wont be sorry.
10 although some people believe that computers turn us children into zombies, i believe that they effect us in a posotive way. computers can help us explore far away places that we @month never go to. maybe help us connect with an old friend or just a little help on homeworks. one reason why i think computers are only helping us is they help us explore othe places. i know for a fact that every kid dreams of a place that they would love to visit. but not at all of us can afford to travel far away. most families however, do have computers. with these computers, kids with a parents permission, can use the internet to learn tons of cool facts about their place.  i have always wanted to go to @location but my parents just don't have the proper incomg  said @person of @caps-@caps @caps school @caps i used my @caps and the internet to discover. hundreds of amazing facts on it.  @caps as you can see computers can help people realize their dreams. another reason why i think computers are good is they help you connect with friends. if you are like me, you like to talk to your friends. a @caps! but sometimes they are too far away to call if you don't want to pay for it. a solution a new wonderful machine called. the @caps! you can chat long distances without being for it. this is especially good for me because not too long ago, one of my best friends moved away to @location. i thoughy i would never talk to him again. then i learned about @caps @caps. it allows you to talk whenever you want, whenever you want! now, me and my friend can stay in touch and @caps can you! my finale reason as to why i think computers are good is they can help you on homework too. even have a tricky math problem you couldn't figure out? how about the capital of a state that visit, slipped your mined? well the @caps can solve both of those problems and more! @percent of computers these days come with soft wear in them that comes with a calculator. for the other @percent you can download and install softwear onto your @caps for a low price. and every @caps made in this world has internet capabilities. all's you need to do is it on and get ready for a ride! @caps don'y worry about too much @caps use, because computers can only help us not hurt us. @caps remember, computers help us live our dreams to the full extent. they also help us connect with no another, and help us excel in school. @caps get on, and get goin. have you used your @caps today?
12 dear local newspaper @caps, @caps our technology advance, so do are lives. computers are a perfect way to better our way of life in ways that are benificial to us and future generations. the use of computers, and the @caps alone allow us to learn about the way of life in other places on @location talk to people faraway, and express ourselves. computers give us a bright future. first many people, actually @percent of the worlds population are generally stationary, and line in a local town or city environments. this is why computers are so helpful because they give @caps a way to research other places around the globe. @caps can create an interest in other cultures, and shape our opinions @caps @caps discover things about other places. from there, @caps can look at different topics in a wide spread point of view. in doing this @caps will connect to other ways of life. @caps philosopher and poet @person state  @caps learn about ourselves through the discovery of others.  @caps, another particularly handy function of the @caps through computers is @caps can communicate with people who live far away, when @caps couldn't visit otherwise. a @location study showed that actually @percent of use of the computer is communication with sites like facebook or @caps. a scientist in @location, @person, says @caps @caps humans tend to enjoy communication because it gives @caps a sense of unity. this is why so many companies are realizing that sites like @organization, @caps, and @organization are gaining in popularity.  and this is true. it is enjoyable to @caps, talk, or email others. without computers, this couldn't be possible. lastly, computers give us the chance to express our ideas like never before. now, stars aren't only made in @location, but now you can make yourself famous on @caps or @caps. just ask @person, who's voice reached out and caught the attention of a major record company. now, everyone knows his name and listens to his music. like @person, the more wordy folks can express themselves by blogging their opinions.   about half of computer use,   says @caps to computer weekly, @person,  is using blogs and videos to state one's ideas.  @caps can persuade others to think @caps @caps do and discover thngs that @caps have discovered. self-expression is very important to society, and this is why computers have such an affect on people. @caps it is clear, computers have a positive affect on people and society. they allow us to learn about faraway places, communicate with others, and inspire the world around us with our ideas. welcome to the future.
10 dear newspaper of @location, the use of the computer is a controversial topic. many people have varying opinions & beliefs, but i personally believe that computers have a positive effect on the people who use & operate them. these remarkable devices give people the ability to talk & be social with friends and family members. they let people know what is going on in the world, and give updates on the condition of countries and events. they will also provide information, and give people the ability to research and learn more about a topic or idea. a computer is a necessity in todays society, & to go against it is a proposterous motion. many people young & old are starting to use the computer to be social with friends & family members through various types of websites & programs. a computer is to talk to someone without physically being there. the social aspect of a computer is rising in popularity and many people are using computers to be social. social networking sites, and instant messaging programs are just two at the many ways to be socially active on a computer. a social networking site as a website that allows you to make an account and post pictures and information for your friends to see. to take away the computer would take away many peoples social lives. the computer benefits many people socially and this has a positive effect on their lives. todays news is always with exciting events and horrible disaters that many people like to be updated with. most people do not like to wait for the newspaper to arrive to read about the fastest news. so they check online and find about it there. online news is widely popular & extremely beneficial to many people. it provides them with the lastest stories and updated events. online news was extremely crucial in the lastest disaster, the earthquake in @location. because online news is so fast and easy to acess. people were donating & helping @location just a day after the earthquake happened. the fast response is what is helping @location rebuild from the rubble. computers provide people with online news & this is definitely beneficial to their lives. before people starting using computers to research topics & ideas they would use books. they would have to shuffle through piles of pages and articles in newspapers. this is a very inefficient & disorganized way to be research. now we have the computer. the computer allows you to recall through endless information and topics. it is not possible to an article or essay with information because it will always be in the same place. this allows for guide and efficient research. there are also websites called online databases on the internet. all have to do is type in a keyword or phrase and you have instant research on whatever you wont you wont information on. all this takes time off of research and put it on whatevers else you would wanting to be doing, whether it is writing a paper or doing a presentation. the computer allows for quick and beneficial research. the computer hasn't been in use for that long and it is already helping society expand & grow. it provides a social aspect where you can talk to friends & family. you can provide yourself with the lastest news & stories, and you can do quick & easy research. a computer without a doubt has a positive effect on society and we as people. the experts can say what they want, but the computer is and always will be benefit to society.
9 there are so many different sides to this computer problem, well it's simple computers ruin our lives. now think if it how many @caps do you see your kid on it? computers messes up kids grades. it stops people from taking a car ride to @organization's house. also people don't ride their bikes a lot. computers are an outrage. it first starts off with grades. the parents tell their kid go and start your paper. they sayd ok, and then they are down there on facebook. more @caps then not kids and parents abuse the computer. in fact @percent of america do uses it, that might seem like a small percent but thats more than half the country. me i don't abuse the computer be i need to keep @caps grades up. most students have @caps-average because studies show it's because of computers. also if your son has a lapttop they're not doing work if that is what you think. i have computers, but we have, books for a reason, no spank, pop ups, or no distractions while working. like one time i was working on a project, a pop-up came up and read trafic rush free to your computer. so dume me downloads it and @caps parents caught me playing. has this changed your mind. since you probably haven't changed your mind here is another thing way computer bad, your car. all guys love cars. computers are holding more thand @percent of people working or driving their cars. te only person it hasn't affected is @caps dad, he works on his cars day in and day out. @caps grandmom said something interesting to me the after day, @caps your dad comes up to visit me more can @caps other sons, @caps ohter sons are carzy for computers. people go bannas for computers today. latly i have seen less and less people outside anymore. there is only reason for that, all people are shaved in their basement in the dark, so when their light it gurns their eyes it's so bright. come on did this change your mind yet now. well since you are still reading on that means you cannot make up your mind. well here's this people are starting to not want to ride their bikes anymore. that is facebook, this is what they thinks, @caps it talk now why i need to ride to talk in person?  that @percent right for what they are think. because we task a test of all the kids who have facebook, and that's what around all of them said. i know amazing @caps a at home mother said,  @caps son's gaining weight, all her does is eat and go on facebook. when he not on during they day, i catch him at night too.  that is a sad story for that mohter. i ride @caps bike a lot, this is a real life story: once i was sitting around doing nothing really did @caps mom said we are riding bikes for @num miles. i got up end did it too. that had to change your mind, or nothing will. so, in conclusing i have no more ideas for no computers and why. but just remember your grades, cars, and your weight. so please, change your mind.
7 dear, news paper i think computers are good, this is because you can learn thing's about faraway places using them, you can also hear about the most recent news and you can communicate with people. in school a lot of the research projects on other places focus on other places around the world. when you use a computer you can read articles about the place and also get pictures and use them in a slideshow or photo story. their are also educational websites that kids can go on to learn their math facts to multuplication tables @caps the computer is a good learning tool. the computer can keep you up-to-date with the news to! their are news website that post minute to minute things about world news and tell the world what kind of desaster happened in some far away place on the other side of the world. a lot of the time families are spread all over the world, you can chat with family or friend's that have moved by a simple chat room and you can catch up on what has been happening in each other's lives and that's a good tool for family to stay in touch @caps the computer has lots of benefits that a lot of people all around the world can use, from learning. about a faraway country to chatting with cuson that lives in california and also knowing whats going on in your own home town.
10 dear local newspaper @caps are you adminitrating your loacl newapaper to society? you are probably using a computer to type the documents. if the government, businesses, schools, students and local newspaper are using computers for a variety of different tasks then @caps are thet not helpful? primarily, computers are used for typing, editing and presenting as stated before, local newpaper are required to use computers to present their work. as a member of society, i knew i would not want to read something not typed anyway. the govermnet must announce laws to the people and use typed documents to communicate with different countries & states. without computers signs, flyers, bussinesses, and even newspapers would not be possible. you are running late to work able to traffic on the hignway. @caps are you supposed to explain to your boss in time? you can simply email him the situation and arrive stress-free to work. prctically the entire world uses computers as a source of communication, so why be indifferent? computers make life easier for people through communication like email, social network websites such as facebook and aol, and even video chat. computers supply an excellent source of communication that is even used throughout schools. teachers and administrater interact with each other with important message using computers. if computers are important to them, the @caps could they be destructive to society? as a western middle school students, i know the amount of projects and research we are required to do per class. without the internet this would almost be impossible. the internet allows research to happen. after reseach is finished, the paper or homework assignment must be typed and printed. without the assitance from computers, ahving naetly-written and well-researched assignments would not be possible. to conclusion, i feel that computers are an excellent advance in technology and should be used as frequently as possiblr. without them, newspaper could not print, teachers could not communiacte, and students couldn't complete tasks for school. as a student i know they help me with school and communicating with my friends and relatives. if computer are such a helpful source to society, why would people consider them as a concern?
8 dear local newspaper, @caps you think computers have a positive or negative effect on people? i personally think computers have a positive effect on people because with computers many people @caps research about the past. also i don't agree that computers have a negative effect on anybody because with computers many people learn hand-eye coordinations, gives them the ability to learn about faraway people and places, they also allow people to talk to old friends or family members. then, computers can also be used to help someone find information about nature such as different trees, plants, animals, and many other things that are involved in nature. after that, computers are also sometimes used to contact people who live faraway from you. some ways to contact people on a computer are using e-mails, instant message, facebook, myspace, and many other websites. in addition, i think computers have a positive effect on people, but others maya not agree which is fine because not everybody has the same opinion on stuff in the world. then, computers can be very useful to many people because they can use computers if they need to find information on history, any events that might have went on in the past that might not still be done in the present. finally, computers are useful to scientists, business workers, many adults, and even children use computers if they need to type something for school or need to find information for a project they're doing.
10 in my opinion, having computers is avery nice thing and does good in our society. i think this because of three reasons, @organization, it allows people to relax and wind down after a long day of work. second, it allows people to communicate with their friends, @caps, it helps with schoolwork and makes things much easier. these are only a few of the reasons why computers do good in our society. @organization off, i'd like to say that after a long day of work, all you want to do is relax. television gets boring and you just want to sit and play games on the computer. well, thats a great way of winding down on a rough day. you can go on @caps and watch funny videos or go on @caps and on you friends new photo album. your @organization computer is to do many things. there are @caps many game , such as @caps come or @caps cam that can be a lot of fun. do you see why the computers a good way of calming down? other than winding you down on a rough day at work, on the computer @caps allow you to communicate with friends and family. aim is a good way to talk to friends and plan get together. or, you can just have simple talk @caps and @caps are great websites to keep in touch with old friends of you, @caps even make new friends. a lot of teenagers and adults have @caps because it gets. so @caps that you can't get off it. as you get older, you dont talk to your friends that much and soon you don't have many friends at all. @caps prevents that so you can always talk to them. you should always keep in touch with friends. most importantly, you use the computer for school work. without it you can't get picture off @organization or type an essay that due. @caps, you can't search words on @location. some teachers require you to type out essays and other don't. you need a computer if your teacher require you to type things. i go on swifts website to see if i have homework dure and that helps me out a teachers @caps put extra credit online. all in all computes are good for society. @organization, you can just calm down and relax. second, you can talk to old friends and keep in touch with new ones. @caps and most importantly, it's very useful when it comes to schoolwork and up pictures/ . now you must understant when i tell you that computers are important and very useful in society.
10 dear local newspaper @caps, @caps show that @percent of humans in the @location alone spend most of their time on a computer or laptop. i believe that the effect of computers has a negative effect on humans because it creates people to have a lack in exercise and it limits the physical interaction with others. as a nation, we can lower the statistic above and create a better environment altogether. the amount of people that lack a sufficient quantity of exercise has risen in the past decade. doctor @person, who is expert in the connections between health and computers, surveyed @num people. out of those people, @percent said they rarely go outside because theu are trapped in the cyber world. this shocking percent proves that only one in twenty people actually get some tyoe of exercise. @person stated,  this shocking @caps means that most -if not all- all people are unhealthy physically, which is a problem that must be solved.  @caps goes on to say that being on a computer for most of the day and not exercising is what contributes ti unhealthiness. in addition to lacking exercise, many humans are losing the physical interaction that they should have. as humans have become, modernized with technology, most humans lose the physical interaction that they world normally have encountered if they we not on the computer. @person agreed with this statement and said,   i am a college greaduate; i have a degree and all, but i wasn't always like this. when i was younger, i owned a computer. as soon as i got home from school, i would always go on the computer. i wouldn't talk to anyone-not even my family! if i could go back and change that, i would.  this statement proves that the lack of physical interaction with human is a crucial subject to touch on. @person regreted it all and changed his ways once @caps got to high school. no one wants to live with regrets, so physical human interactions are necessary to live a non-regretful life. the lack of human interaction and lack of exercise are problems that need to be solved as soon as possible. in conclusion, using computers has started a growing epidemin in the @location. the most important reasons as to why computers have anegative effect on humans are it limits the amount of exercise, and it almost destroys the physical interactions between humans. thank you for your attention, and remeber one thing: computers can always have a negative effect on many humans lives.
9 computers and modern technology are advancing quickly, and more and more people are beginning to use them. some people say that computers are a bad influence on @location. i think other wise. i think computers are an amazing breakthrough in modern science. i believe computers are ideal for school work and comunicating with others, as long as they are used in moderation. computers make school projects so simple i don't know if we could do without. our social studies teacher @person says that @percent of his projects involve something on the computer. the internet is a great place to research for big papers and projects. with over thirty-million educational and informational websites, its easy to locate what you need quickly and easily. once you have finished researching it is easy to type your report. if it isn't a written report, then there are many other programs for fancy presentations. take microsoft @caps for example: you can make exotic background and texts, as well as unique animations to emphasize or to make it pop right off the page. computers are also an ideal way to communicate with friends and family. emailing is quick and easy to tell others what you want to say. if you want to chat, then you can use @caps or instant messaging. this allows you to type and sent emails faster. both of these programs are an inivative way to talk with a family member that isn't home. like lets say my dad goes on business to @location. we can email back and forth every day. and now with @organization (a video chat) you can see the person and actually talk to them like they're back at home. computers have their advantages but they also have disadvantages. computers are great for communicating and school work, but when used in excess can be unhealthy. here is one example: my older brother @person is a senior in high school. he is in school from @num to @num:pm and as he gets home he heads straight for his computer. he is on there for at least five hours a night and that leaves time for dinner and not much of anything else including sleep. i think that computers are a great invation in modern technology as long as people limit themselves. computers are coming out with new features everyday and who know theyll be like...
9 dear local @organization @caps of @location, latly i have been noticing that some of the citizens of @organization have been using computers and laptops for a good amount of three the some people to the say @caps is a waste of time they could enjoying with family and friends with friends and family far away. @caps helps with research and learn @organization thnigs and @caps help with relaxing people. modern time and the people who disagree enjoy some family and friends lives far away and you cant talk to them in person. there is always calling them or writing them a letter hot email, facebook, and @organization are easier and to use. when you call you dont know if your them there phones bissy, or they a bad @caps takes long and you @caps better to stay and send on and know you didn't @caps helps in advertisment and sales. sometimes maybe unrealible because anybody can change anything on the site. not all things online are like that though. stay away from scares and things, they will came some people find the internet @caps could be there from work or sites. there are fun games and to talk to in research the internet helps @percent of people relax and calm down after a long @caps, when on the computer or laptop which helps with stress. computers can help in many ways. there are other realiable things. plus where ever you go you will find the internet.
9 dear newspaper, in our town, more people are on the computer each day. some people state that you can do a lot on the computer and talk to people. but, i believe that our town should not support advances in technology. you will have more time to exercise, talk to family and friends in person and to take part in different activities around the town. do you want to be overweight and not be in shape? well, if you sit at the computer all day every day, you will become like that.  i think exercise shoud be a part of everybody's day,  @caps teacher @person from @location stated. you would be so attatched to your computer, that you wouldn't work out. in the state of @location, it is proven that @percent of residents are overweight from not exercising and @percent are overweight by not eating properly. this shows more people in @location don't exercise than not eating properly. @caps wants to be overweight and you can change that! more people each year make facebook and @caps @caps. some kids in school are on the internet all day talking to friends who live down the street. students refuse to talk to their friend on the phone. instead, they do it online.  @caps can understand their tone of the message sent,  @person stated. you could interpret it in different ways. when you are on the phone, it is a quick and easy way to communicate not waiting for somebody to type back. if you are a person who is always on the computer, plan a get together with your friend to talk in real life. sidewalk sales, clubs, sports teams, holiday stroll, these are events that every town offers! instead of sitting dreaming of being on the team, go out and do it! each town cares about its residents and want them to have fun. that is why towns offer these activities.  @caps want to make the town interasting and everybody to know each other,  says @caps @caps @person. if you participate in these activities, you will meet other kids your age around the town. if your town offers all of these activities, they are helping you out. being out helping the town is way better than sitting in your house on the computer! in many ways both advancing technology or not, why be inside doing nothing but talking to people? go and talk to them in real life. being in shape, talking to people in real life and activities your town offers is the way to go. thank you for your concern
9 according to @person, economic @caps, every hour you spend on the computer, you raise your electricity bill by @money. the average @caps spends @num hours on the computer everyday. i believe that spending too much time on the computer could be a bad thing. you have economic loss from the electric bill, health loss because you won't be able to exercise as much, and community less because you won't spen as much with your community. financial loss is something that many people are concerned about. if everybody spent @num less hour on the computer, they could save @money off their electric bill. in a survey, @num out @money @num people said they would do anything to save money. so if they spent less time on the computer they would save lots @money money. in addition to financial loss there is also a health issue. many people are talking about how americans are becoming obise. part @money this is due to spending too much time on the computer. proffesor @caps @money @organization says that,  the obisety in @location is a problem, if people spent less time on the computer and more time exercising, that problem would be solved.  @caps, @num out @money @num people are obese. if everyone spent @num less hour on the computer, it would become @num out @money @num. although health is a problem community is a bigger one. people never talk to eachother face to face anymore. they all talk on @caps or @caps. commmunities are spending less time together in real life than on the computer. @person, expert on human behavior, says that when people spend less time on the computer, ther spend more time together. it's a fact that when people spend more time together, they have more fun. so, i would say that spending less time on the computer would be beneficial to our community. it would provides financial, health, and community benefits. these are all important things that we lack if we spend too much time on the commputer.
8 do you think being able to look up information on anything or talk to people that are for away is ggod? with a computer these are some things that you will be able to do. being able to talk to anyone that is far away is good. some people have family in other countries that they have not seen in a long time and with a computer you can talk to them. @caps the people we have sent to @organization they have a family here and i have heard of them using computers to talk to them because they miss them. also if you live in an area that gets bad weather and you can not go anywhere a computer can help pass the time, @caps the people that live in the @caps they can get alot of snow during the winter time and @month have to stay inside. so if they have a computer they are able to do things @caps play some games or can watch some videos to pass the time. another thing a computer is good for is that you are able to search for anything. you are able to learn about faraway places even if you have never been there just by looking it up. some kids do have some trouble with some homework but can use a computer to learn some more about it and hopefully they will now understand how the work is suppose to be done instead of going to the teacher tomorrow and telling them that you did not do it. there are my opinions why a computers have a positive effect on people. by being able to search anything, help children with homework, and pass the time if you have nothing to do.
8 dear editor, @caps do you do all day? the answer to that would probably be sit down in front @organization a computer all day. my friends say that this is very unhealthy, research as proven it and my mom has had experience with the computers. this just isn't healthy for our envierment and people. @percent @organization my friends say that computers are a waste @organization time. most people who interact on the computer all day don't have a stable diet or even a good excersice ruinte. they say that all the junk kids and grown-ups acumulate in their daily life is unhealthy and will never go away unless they get up. they also say that without excersice our country will be filled with over weight people. dr. @organization has done extensive research and has proven that computers are bad for you. @person has gone all over the country to talk to people, and he specifically stresses that more people should get out and enjoy the nature but, no their sitting in front @organization a computer which is not good for them. he's taught people that @percent @organization the time if you get out and have fresh air your life will be so much better. my mom has had experience with computers and asures me that when she was younger you couldn't just sit there and not get out. she says that it's important to interact with your family and friends so you keep a stable relationship. talking to your family will keep them intact with @caps's going on in your life and hanging out with your friends will help with having more @organization a life without your household. she says any kid who does sit in front @organization a computer all day should be disappointed @organization themsleves. editor you've done a wonderful job since you've taken the job! so, i feel that if you stress the point in your next newspaper about not having computers all the time you should always excersice like my friends say, the research as taught to enjoy your nature and my mother says to interact with your family and friends. i'm sure your next article will be a wonderful dream to people stating facts.
11 dear @caps, @caps, computers. the subject of so many debates over the years, from lawyers against judges to parents against children. could it be to much of a good thing? are computers the cause of increased awkwardness in today's society. certainly it can't be to good that your entire life is documented on a place where anyone can go. and then there is the content of what you are viewing. i can't wait to get to that paragraph. one of the top @num picked-through subjects in the world, are people really less interested in exercise than they were in the @num's? studies show that in the @caps @caps, @num out of @num people were overweight. that number has risen to @num out of @num, as of @date. amazing! and some of these people might be safer staying inside. if you've played a video game where the player can lose health, you'll know what happens when the bar runs out. you restart. after playing @caps @caps @caps @caps @caps, @caps@number @caps @month want to try that gravity-defying, head-turning stunt. and let me tell you, there is no restarting after that. did you know that @organization is recording everything you do online? if say, you are a budding guitarist and are looking around for a new gibson, you'll start getting all these ads for online stores, @caps? because @organization sells your info to businesses. and you give them permission by clicking that continue with install button. so spam email comes. but something even worse is on the way. your bank account number. thats right, i went there. if a virus get onto your computers, your many could vanish. so be responsible. this brings us to our last subject. the touchy one. it used to be that you had to buy a magazine or book to witness the exploitation of young women. now, it is just the click of a button away. and that is bad enough. young boys are snagged early, their futures now controlled by this disease. but add to that the imense risk of a virus attack, and you're in a heap of trouble. so i'm not saying computers are terrible, just that they they could be to much of a good thing. sometimes they can be a good way to relieve stress, by taking it out on a hapless alien. just use the technology at your hands responsibly.
10 dear readers of @organization, @caps people today are depating whether having a computer benefits society. computer benefit society in @caps way like it could help the childer with thrie school work. not @caps childern are very out going but if they had a computer thatn that will really help them. not @caps kids have ways to find out what their going to be in live. i'm pretty sure they don't care right now but the computer will help them out. as you can see the computer can help society. every childern who goes to school has homework since kindergarten to when they end school. the computer can help them with their math homeworks, thier science, and even their sosial studies homework. when your kids get older starting middle school they have to do reports & pajects that recuar knolige tobe able to write or do the paper. if your a and can't take your childern to the libarey to take out @caps books that could get lost and you would have to pay for something that has been but and is not ablt o use again. but the computer all of that to society. the compter can help the comuncation in so @caps ways. @caps kids like to go on @caps to chat and parents think that @caps is their world, but it could happen that they are aranging a group to for. now a days their are a lot more shier people who are scared to @organization people and be friend. but now their could be a lot more depress. the computer could also help you because you could be late or unable to go to an apointment or to a meeting & you lot the person in. this is a great way why computers help societey. in sociatey their are not a lot of people who now right away what they want to be when they grow up. if they us the computer and are really good at fixing them when the're broken that the ran be as computer @caps are so @caps beautful places that people take pictures of and up loud them into their computer. some people don't see their talent until someone points it out to them. @caps people could be have a bad day and write a story out of it and send it to some of their friends, @caps their friend can send itto a publushers and make this person @caps. as you can see their are so @caps great ways you can use the computer to help your sociatey. readers the computer can help you in your school work. the computer can help the socitey communicat. it could also help people find their @caps. i think that the computer does a great @caps helping the sociatey.
8 do you think computers have a negative effect on people? well i don't i think @caps is on easier way to get information faster. the three reasons why i believe computers have a positive effect on people are to learn about faraway places, to have jobs in the computer, business, and you are able to talk to people from faraway. these are many other reasons but i'@caps only required to talk about three. first of all, you are able to learn about faraway places you can learn about places you aren't able to see in real life. @caps is a faster way to get information about news that wouldn't be able to out on newspaper until the next day. if you dont have money to travel then you could just go on the internet and see the faraway places in many ways, @caps's just a better source of information. my second reason is to have a job in the computer business. there are alot of jobs that require computers. if we didn't have computers more and more people would not have jobs. also, business would be slow because they wouldn't have the information they needed. that is why computers are needed. lastly, you are able to talk to people from faraway, yes people are able to talk through the phone but its not the some if you get to talk and see the person. video chat is a great way to make new friends and still talk with your old friends. you can talk to relatives, friends, or anyone you want to talk to. if we didn't have computers you would lose touch with people you know that live faraway from you. that would be a terrible thing. in conclusion computers are an easier way to get information. you can learn about faraway places. you can have a job in the computer business. lastly, you are able to talk to people from faraway, i think computers are a positive thing.
9 dear local newspaper, this world is filled with electronics. these days the computer is the latest hit. but even though it's popular, is it really the best item to have? many children and even adults are hooked onto the computer. it is taking away their life. four out of five people each year are losing interest in going outside to play. that's not how you should spend your life. we all want our children to be active and healthy, not be a couch potato. each day, more kids are getting addicted to the computer. now, every time a parent needs to punish or  ground  their child, they take away the electronics. what ever happened to grounding them from going to hang out with their friends or just playing outside? another horrifying conclusion that the computer does to us is rip apart us from our loved ones. kids are more worried about  @caps  or  @caps  or even trying to slay a dragon than spending time with their family. they would pick the computer over someone who has been in their life forever. this computer is splittling families apart. now, more families only spend time with each other when they eat dinner together. also, rather than talking to their parents about a problem, kids are going to websites like  @caps  or  @caps.com . more people don't enjoy doing some things now because of the computer. not many like going out and enjoying nature. some don't like reading anymore because they rather play games. some people don't even want to pick up the phone and call for a pizza. also people who look for jobs don't go to the newspaper anymore; they go to the internet! the world is revolving around electronics. we need to end this before our kids or grandchildren start getting out of shape and start relying on the comuter for everything. do we really wan't to destroy this world and lose bonding with our families? i say, make life better and get rid of computers!
9 dear @caps @caps, @caps @caps all the talk about computers these days i would have to agree with the people who think its taking up alot more of our time. i hardly ever see people playing outside anymore because apparently computers are far more entertaining then being with your friends and family. why do you think the obesity is so high these days? well theres one of the reasons and i @caps when my parents were kids that they had no computers and they went outside to enjoy nature. computers have there ups and downs but i do not think they benifit out society, first reason being, computers are taking away time to be with our friends and family. i rember when facebook and @caps werent created those were the days when people actually did fun things with there friends and family. there was a recent study that snowed since @date to @percent of all americans use computers more than @num @caps a day for all sorts of diffrent reasons. i think mainiy computers were invented to make reason easier but now adays all we use them for is social networking. my second biggest point as to why computers do not benifit our is because over the past @num years the obesity rate has gone up by @percent and due to what cause? eating un healthy food and sitting in front of your computers all day not exersiing. i am almost @percent sure that if people stoped using computers that our world would be a healthier place. dont you feel bad for those people who are stuck being ovwrsized for there whole life because of these habits? i @caps most people would feel bad. my last reason is that we have this ahmazing planet that no one seems to enjoy anymore becaus they use up all there time on computers if only people got out every once and a while they would relize they have been wasting where time. there been a recent study that says @percent of people are inside doing nothing all day! thats more than half!! i hope this will change somtim soon because computers hace only created a nusence to people and now it seems like no one has any type of a life.. computers hace spread to all sorts ofs societys but please let it not take over this friendly town of @caps.
9 dear newspaper editor, i think that computers are @caps for everyone. first of all, you can learn about places that are around the world in a click. also, you can communicate with friends and family. finally, it makes your life so much easier. here are some reasons why you should get a computer for your family. first, you can learn about things you didn't even know were real, in an instant. you can learn about ancient civilizations, different cultures, and different recipes for tonights dinner. you can get help in school work also. if you need to learn about the @caps @caps of @location, all you have to do is type in it. if you need to learn your multiplication table, you type it in and it will show up in the matter of seconds. the internet is @caps for searching up all types of things. secondly, you can talk to your family members and friends on the internet. ive heard a lot of people saying people need to spend more time with their family. so on the computer you can talk to someone in @location, and evrywhere else. its like a pen pal but you don't waste money buying envelopes and stamps to send a letter. computers cost a lot of many but it is worth it. you can do almost evrything on the computer. lastly, if you get a computer it makes your life so much easier. instead of going to the library and getting a cook book, you can type in dinner recipies for chicken. your computer will come up with hundreds of different ways to make a @caps chicken for dinner. you can tell a friend that you cant it to there party. also, teaches you homework that you did. if you buy a computer your life would be more relaxing. in conclusion, you should buy a computer. if you do you will learn so many things. its like having a book with everything you will every need or want to know. this is why computers are good to have and be on for a reasonable amount of time. 
10 dear @caps, @caps do people benefit from the use of computers. some say that using computers rather than exercising and being outside is a bad thing. i personally believe that the use of computer technology is a good thing. computers teach hand-eye cordination, help people learn, and allow people to communicate with others. the use of computers teach hand-eye cordination and reaction time. some say that being outside and exercising is better than using a computer but many computer games help hand-eye cordination. alter playing computer games more and more the time it takes for you to react to the game you are playing and hit the mouse button is very important. these skills could help you in the activities you take part in and every - day life, personally, i play a lot of @caps @num, a computer gaming system. @caps has helped ny hand-eye cordination greatly and it has shown in the four sports that i play. clearly, computers can be very helpful and can help your hand - eye cordination. computers can also help people learn in many ways. there is a lot of content on the internet that simply can't be in school. the ability to learn about foreign countries is a big part in learning as a student. i use the internet nearily every night to type my papers and find the information that i need. it has helped one as a student. also, typing papers on computers is becoming the new @caps of hand writting. teachers are beginning to require that school work is typed on a computer and printed. documents can be saved do that they cannot be lost inlike a hard copy written by hand. although many believe that using a computer is a waste of time, it can also help you stay organized. many people have calenders in their computers that send you reminders on your schedule. your computer is also where your data like music and pictures can be saved. computers are also very useful for learning and organizational purposes. we can communicate with others using computers. people use computer technology to communicate everyday through @caps, @caps, and i-chat. if i need to know what our homework is or when practic is i use my computer to ask someone for the answer. before i began communicating with my computer talking to others was much harder to do. although many disagree with using computer technology, computers are often the way we communicate with foreign countries. when something happens overseas the first way we found out about it is a computer. it is essential for us to use computers to communicate with other nations. clearly computers are importan for communication purposes, we must continue to use computers for multiple reasons. although many disagree with the use of computers, there hand - eye, communications, and learning purposes are very important. without computer technology we would function much differently. it is up to you to continue using computers. 
8 i think computer have shaped @location to what it is today. computer help people learn, give people a passtime, and all of that can be managed in a certain space of time so you still have time to go outside. computers help everyone learn. it makes things easier by typing up essays because you could type it faster and its eaiser to make changes. also, its cheaper to buy a computer and go on the internet and look up foreign countries then acually going there. another example, is that a computer teachees you hand-eye coordination from typing and using the mouse. finally, computers can teach you life lessons by reading articles another person wrote. computers give bored people passtimes. one example, is that you can play computer games during rainy days or when you can't go outside. also, you can talk to friends through facebook or aim. another example, is that you can talk to distant family in another country by using programs such as skype. finally, you can order stuff online instead of wasting gas and going to the store and the things you might order you can play with outside. a lot of people say computers keep kids inside don't know that their are ways to prevent this. one example is you can use shut-off timers that keep anyone from going onto the computer for to long. also, many people learn how to manage their time on the computer. another example, is that parents can make rules that their children aren't allowed to play games on the computer on certain days and/or times. finally, you can keep the computers in the family room so that children don't play with it all night in their room. those are just some of the many reasons why computer help @caps. they help us learn, pass the time, and it can all be manage during a certain amount of time. now reading this i hope you believe that computers benefit society.
10 dear local newspaper, @caps well @caps many others, i believe computers are not only good, but beneficial. computers are advanced our world little by little every day. we all use them for communication, entertainment, and knowledge. computers are like people with fun to do and things to learn. computers are beneficial to everyone worldwide. computers gradually advance communication more and more everyday. it used to be old letters by mail, then it became e-mails, twitter, and facebook. these websites upgrage communication today. long distance friends can view photos, information, videos, and chat from far away. some site like @organization allow you to instant message your friends. lastly, video chatting is a new improved way to see a live video of the other person. according to @organization @num more user signed up for web-cams since the beggining of @date. communication is positively affected by computers. i know you @month have fun with sports or nature, but sometimes it is great to get great entertainment for yourself instantly. computer games only cost about @money and are instant access. also, surfing the web for news or funny videos is fun sometimes. almost everyone who has a @caps gets a blast surfing the internet. do you ever wonder how to hear the song you like when it's not on the radio? itunes stores, organize, and plays music in a virtual library for permanent access. what also happens is youtube allows you to watch music videos or hear songs for free. now thats why computers are straight entertainment. finally, computers provide you with so much knowledge and is great for education. certain websites let you access tons of knowledge. wikipedia and diccionary.com are great for learning.

8 did you ever need to know something about another place, or maybe want to see your baby cousin who is not a baby anymore? having a computer is a huge benefit to society. it not only ables you to find out information, and chat with family and friends but also can teach you hand eye coordination. a computer can tell you just about anything you need to know. this could help you learn about other cultures, places, or something as simple as what is @location creampie. the computer has endless knowledge. this is a huge benifit because a computer is one of the few tools that could help you expand your learning with a click of a button. having a computer also allows you to talk to family and friends. new computers now have webcams. this benifits you to see and speak to them without having to get on a plane or any long car rides. which i know is a big benifit for everyone who has relatives that don't live right next door whether it helps your swing in baseball or to catch that touchdown, having a computer is a big help in hand-eye coordination. believe it or not, having to type a paper for school helps out alot in hand-eye coordination. having hand-eye coordination can help you out a lot in life whether in activities, school work, or jobs. it is obvious that having a computer is a huge benifit to society by having that ability to learn more, chatting with family and friends, or to help you pass the football with one of your buds. the society today wouldn't be the same without computers.
8 dear local newspaper, i am writing to you because computers are affecting humans in many ways. some can be terrible, and others not so bad. many average people are now staying inside all day on the computer playing games, or on facebook and other interactive websites such as twitter and @caps. this crisis is interfering with school, work, or excersize. more and more people each day are not getting enough exercize or work done. we have to stop this devastating pandemic! people who are staying inside all day arn't as healthy as they were before. there immune system making the risk of getting sick greater. this can cause people in severe positions or even death. @caps you stay inside all day every day, the computer will be so addicting it will take over you and make it more important. in order to maintain healthy you have to eat right and good in riding a bike. @caps someone is inside on the computer frequently, they arn't @caps you're addicted to something like watching t.v. or playing @caps, @caps you are addicted to the it can also interfere with family events, sports. @caps youre on the computer you forget about homework, grades drastically making you go to summer school, or even repeating a grade. also @caps you don't prepare for sports it can make you not play up to your potential. this is why computers are affecting every day people. there are more reasons how people are being affected by computers, but these are the most common.
8 @organization, @caps is a lot of positive things about technology, especially computers. computers gives you a chance to communicate with people from all around the world; also computers gives you the opportunity to go on educating websites, and last makes it easier to shop and pay bills. talking to people from around the world can be interesting. computers help you do that, using the internet. you can learn almost different people and their cultural background, or even talk to your friends and families that live in other cities, states, or maybe even countries. yes, some people might say they cost too much, but that's really only a one ime price. computers can be very helpful to students as well as teachers. that reason is because students can get homework help on educating websites. on the other hand it helpful for teachers because they can put their students grades online and won't have kids bugging you about what's their average in a certain class. yes, i know their are bad unappropriate websites, but their are a lot of ways to block them. for an example i had a @caps in @caps and i needed a lot of help, and my teacher told me about a website called studyisland and by going on that everyday boosted my grade up to a @caps. computers give you a chance to get your bills paid and do some shopping for a cheaper price. their are ways that your things that you buy online could come a few days late; but think about how much time and money your saving because you ordered offline instead of going to the store. but it's also very helpful to people with disability. they're are a lot of positive things about computers. they give you a chance to communicate with people across the world, and gives you a chance to go on educating websites, and last helps you pay bills and go shopping. local newspaper computers are a big benefit too society, and without them a lot of things would'nt be possible.
10 computers are becoming a household item in the @location and around the world. there is a problem through, because some people believe that computers don't benefit society. in my opinion, computers are a @caps thing for our everyday lives. the internet allows us to communicate with friends, family, and more people around the globe! its various programs help keep files and other things of that nature organized and updated. finally, computers are a @caps resource when researching for projects, reports, homework, or anything else that requires information to complete. the world is a large place with many people, places, regions, and countries. families sometimes move far away from their families and friends, so they want to keep in contact. post is a very slow and costly service, while the internet is cheaper and quicker! im's, @caps @caps, use one of these fast and cheap ways. they allow you to send a message and receive a message on any day, at anytime, in any place with little of no hassle involved. another way is to use websites like @caps and @caps, which allow you to update your  status  on your wall so everyone on your friends list can see or comment on. the final and last way is by using a webcam, which enables you to see the person on the other end of the  call  and you can also hear their voices. this is the best way, in my opinion, because instead of sending text and pictures they can explain everything in their own way with no limit on how much they can say. many people have noticed that the world is not an organized place. computers help organize it with their many applications and programs like @organization apps, @caps, and document folders. @organization is a chain of apps for everything from writing documents to making spreadsheets to making presentations and even to making fliers for special events. these apps are the basic to starting up a business or promoting an invention. @caps mainly centers on keeping information stored an organized in files however you wish and is @caps for quick access to them. my parents and other adults i know always say  organization is the key to success , so @caps definetly helps. the final and most basic way that computers help for organization are document folders. these little things come in handy when you need to save something quickly bu want to keep it organized. all you have to do is name it, click save, and bada bing bada boom you're done! most importantly, computers come in handy when researching for projects or something else that requires lots of up-to-date information. books will take a few days and you only have @num days to research, create, and organize your project and data. what are you gonna do now? you could hand it in late, but then you'll yet in trouble. here is where the fast and reliable internet comes in if you need to know the difference between @person and @person, use the search engine @organization. if you have a question about the @caps @caps, use @location. anything at all that you @month need is at the tips of your fingers, with a little help from your computer and internet of course. in conclusion, i would like to state that computers aren't a good thing for society, they are a @caps thing for civilization! from communicating with friends and family around the world to organizing our everyday lives and helping us research important topics, the internet and computers are a @caps way to help out our lives in my opinion. wouldn't you agree with me?
9 i believe that computers have a great effect effect on people. people all around the world use computers to talk online with other people, give people ability to learn about faraway people and places, and also let you explore the internet computers are a great influence on our lifestyle. computers allow people from around the world to interact with friends and family. some websites that allow you to do so are myspace, facebook, and @organization. with facebook you can take a picture of yourself and place it on your web page. it is relly quite easy. also, with @organization you can chat with your best friends and can actually see what they are doing. but if you want to do this you are going to need a webcam. i have @organization and i think that it is a wonderful resource. i have relatives in @location that i only get to see once a year. but with the help of my computer i can interact with them all year round. computers can make people from faraway places learn about the culture and ways of another person's lifestyle. have you ever seen the commercial where a little boy is talking to his father on the computer. well, in this commercial is laying down on and is eating an @caps cookie. while he is doing this he is talking on the computer with his dad who is doing the same. at the same time both father and son dip their cokie into a glass of milk, eat it and laugh. i felt at that time that it was a wonderful moment because even though they are both in opposite directions the two are still having a great time. just to think that it was all because of one computer. exploring the internet is what a computer can do. when doing this you can play some really fun games on a rainy day when you are bored. you can look up what happened during one of your favorite basketball games. such as how many points @person got for your fantasy team. also, at my school you can check your grades to see what you got on your last math test or quiz. for example if i had all a's but one @caps in math, then i would know that i would need to really study for my next test to get on a on it. with the help of the internet, i can do. so, now you know wh computers are a very important part of our society. computers allow us to talk online with other people, give people the opportunity to learn about faraway people and places, and computers also allow everyone to explore the internet. as you can see now, computers are great influence to our lifestyle. 
8 dear @caps, @caps you think computers have a possitive effect on people? i know i @caps. computers are good for many reasons: @num reason is because people can learn about far away places; @num they can talk to people and learn about their culture and @num they can teach hand eye coordination. first off if you're taking you want to learn about where you are going. computers can help with that! also if you want to find good hotels you can use the computer for that. if you need transportation just log onto google and type in what you're looking for. now if you are doing a project for school or something on a different area of the world you can log onto your skype, facebook, @caps, @caps, or any other website that you. you can @caps many things while talking to freinds on the internet, such as: find out school assignments, find out due dates, make dates and many more wonderfull things. hand-eye coordination is very important. computers can help with that. drivers need very good hand-eye coordination; if you don't have that then plan on a big insurece bill. if you don't have good hand eye coordination then you are going to have a hard time with a lot of stuff. so thats why computers are a good thing to have in our society. you can learn about where you are going, stuff that you need to get done, and even become a better driver.
10 dear newspaper, i believe that computers have a positive effect on people. i believe this because we can talk to people in different countries in a quarter of a second, we can send e-mails to other people, and finally we can go to @location, ask @caps question and get an instant reply. first, we can talk to people in different countries. did you ever have a relative go on vacation in a foreigh country and have no way of calling them to see if everything is okay? lets say for instance that they brought their laptops but for at their cellphones. then, the only way we can contact them is by e-mail. even if your just happens in you can keep in touch through email. you can even a computer so you can video chat, and not have to wait to get your reply. next, we can send e-mails to other people. have you ever set somebody a letter by mail and had to wait two to three days for a reply? sometimes, your letter is even lost, and these is no way of finding out. well with e-mail, the wait time of your reply depends on how fast the person whom you are talking to types and most people i know can type a reply in @num to @num seconds. i believe that is a from two to three cars. with e-mail those is an eghty three percent chance that your email will not be lost. if for some reason it is lost, there will be a message sent to you telling you that your message was lost and that you need to sent a new message. but most likely chances are that your message wil reach its destination. can go to @location, ask @caps question and get an instant reply. were you ever wondering about something and the answer was on the tip of your tongue but you just cant think of it? if so you probably would be smart to go to @location. you can ask @caps question and get an instant reply. and i mean @caps question you can ask questions from wat the price of is in @location, to what an is. if you wanted to you could ask math questions as well, such as what is the square root of pi, and what is @num. from @location to myspace the internet is full of information that can have a positive effect on people. this is why i think that the has a positive effect on people, we can talk to people different countries we can send e-mails, and we can ask all sorts of questions.
10 i think that computers do benefit us. they allow us to interact with people, talk to family far away, help us with school, gives us easy access to information, and much more people usually have family and friends who live away from each other and the computer allows us to interact with them. the computer lets us email and instant message them, play games against them, be their friend on websites like facebook so you can see recent pictures of them. it's not easy to interact with family and friends who live so far away and the internet allows us to do that. the computer doesn't just let you talk to family and friends but it lets you meet new people and interact with new people from all over the world. it let's you make new friends and play games with them or chat. the computer really helps you to just stay in touch with other people and it's a very easy and convinent way to do so. the next thing the computer helps us with is it entertains us. children are very hiper and after homework is done, we don't have anything to do so the computer let's us play games on it, chat with friends, watch movies and videos, up load picture, etc. it does alot for us. kids could hang out after school but if they can go on the computer it allows them want to go home where their parents know that their safe and away from drugs, alcohol, and other bad things they can get into. just because kids like the computer, that doesn't mean that that's the only thing they do. kids are very athletic, always playing sports and always hiper but the computer helps that go away. they go to school for hours, then go to basketball or football practice, sometimes we just need a break. the computer isn't always fun but it's very useful. the computer helps us with school. it allows us to type essays and projects. it also allows us easy information to help write the essays. websites like google and bing are easy websites to help us get good and accurate information about whatever the topic is that we are doing. the computer is very useful when it comes to school. as you can see, the computer is very important in our lives and makes life alot easy and it's your choice how much you want to spend on it. but no matter what, the computer definatly benefits us.
8 dear newspaper readers, @caps computers have really change the way people use technology. it has made our society different in many ways. people can look at information faster than ever with this device. people can also talk to friends, especially on popular websites, computers are even used in school, mostly in college. @caps an advantage of using it in school, means so much to the people and there education, computers have changed the human race forever. when my grandparents went to school, they had no idea what a computer was. their guide was priar knowledge, knowledge from a teacher, or a dictionary. we are so fortunate today to have even computers in our school because my grandparents would have loved to have something as quick and as simple as a computer. @caps access to a computer can really help people inso many different ways, mainly about the world. what is the first place you would go to talk to people online: @caps. do you man @num out of @num people have @caps. the reason why it is so popular paper want to talk to friends that they enjoy talking too. from my experience out from canada have @caps too, which is surprising. talking to in country is unbelievable. as you're opportunity for people to make new friend. this can also affect the way people lively. when teenagers attend high school, they have a choice of talking a specific, almost like a helping one classes is because when you are in college, so many in a short amount. i have people who stay up for our their paper. @caps these are an advantage for everyday life, especially college because it is an oppurtunity for someone to get better at typing computer classes can really help someone trying to learn how to type at a fast pace, and get a caple more hours of sleep! in conclusion, i believe @caps computers effect our society in a positive way. thank your for reading this letter, and i hope you can take this into consideration. @caps computers have dramatically changed lives forever. 
12 dear @caps of my local newspaper, more and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. these boxes can be harmful to their users' eyes. in addition, they lead to less interaction with  real  people. finally, they lead to a very unhealthy lifestyle. computers are harmful to our society. for starters, computers are harmful because they are very bad for our eyes. between the @date @date and @date, doctors saw nearly a @percent increase in eye problems that resulted in either surgery, glasses, or contacts. this can be directly associated with the overuse of personal computers. also, studies have shown that common citizens who use these cootraptions for over four hours each day end up with an extremely deteriorated vision by the age of @num. finally, @caps @caps stated that overuse of computers have led to a very negative affect on the eyesight of their workers. it can be seen, how work gets done faster, however the cost of medical treatments actually surpasses the little extra profit gained by modernizing. secondly, computers are harmful because they lead to less time being with  real  people. to begin with, studies have shown that people simply don t learn as much about their peers by talking to them through a box. also, a study by the @organization has shown that there are roughly @percent fewer conversations at social gatherings than just @date. this is alarming because at that rate people @month never get to know each other and the world @month become an electronically based workspace. finally @person, social relations professional, stated that people end up with a lack of understanding when they can t feel the emotion a person has when he/she is speaking. sure, you can video chat, but that still does not convey the real feeling behind a person s words. finally, computers are harmful because they lead to a very unhealthy lifestyle. to begin with, the lack of fresh air obtained by sitting indoors all day is very bad for lungs and can lead to premature breathing problems. also, average people get @percent fewer workouts, according to @caps s @caps, which was not likely directly influenced by overuse of computers. finally the obesity rate has risen from next to nothing to over @num in the past ten @date. research showed that the majority of the obese patients spent excessive time on their little boxes of ten. while you might feel that this is not completely due to computers, it has been proven time and time again that these machines are the main reason behind the world s currently unhealthy lifestyle. personal computers have a very negative effect toward the society of today. this technology has resulted in very poor eyesight in the general public. in addition, they lead to a much lower amount of social interaction. finally, they end up forcing people into an unhealthy lifestyle. so, let the word out that computers are bad for society, and try to make the world a better place to live.
9 dear newspaper @caps, @caps people in our community use computers for positive ideas. such as if gives you hadn and eye coordination, gives people the ability to research on far away places and allows you to talk to far away family. this is why i think computers have a positive effect on people. to begin with computers give a positive efect on people because it gives you hand and eye cordination. for example that can help you to have ability to do more. like work somewhere such as a restraunt. this needs lots of cordination for holding heavy trays. my mom is a waitress and she needs a lot of cordination she tells me. another reason would be you would have more hand cordination driving because you can react fast. some people say that computers make you not be able to see while. which than you would need glasses. but thats there desision this can give you one reason that computers are a positive effect on people today. secondly why computers are a positive effect because it gives people the ability to search far away places. why this can be a good thing is because you can get a good idea of what its like and might want to take a trip there. another reason would be that students usually have projects which call for research in other countries. computers make kids smarter that way but some people say that kids could get on a website where it can be bad, which also they arn't getting exersize if all there doing is researching when they can do that in the own town. but about @percent of kids can stil be on the computer than go and get exersize. this is another reason computers are an impact. lastly, why computers are positive is kids and adults can talk to there friends or family quicker. for exmaple if a family member lives far away instead of mail you can send it on the computer in a @num minute send. its quicker and easier. another reason is your kids will be able to talk to there friends faster than mail as well. about @percent of kids use computers to talk to there friends but some people say kids can think there talking to there friends but could be someone bad. but to make sure all your friends should have one question to make sure its there friend. this is why to computers are a positive impact on young adults, and children, parents. to conclude, i would like to say that computers are a positive impact for a couple reasons one it gives you more hand and eye coordination gives people the ability to search other countries and beable to talk to friends. others disagree because it can ruin your eyes, not get exersize and lastly give your child unsafe. but that can be changed easily by limiting kids, see who they talk to and get them in a sport. this is why i think computers are a postive impact.
11 to: the @organization can be a big part mof people's lives, however, some don't realize the negative effect these pieces of technology have. first, staring at a computer screen is unhealthy for your body. secondly, anyone can post information on a website, therefore, it can be inaccurate. lastly, people tend rely on computers too much. computers are negatively impacting our society! the first reason why clearly, computers are not benefiting people is because they can cause unhealthy symptoms. for example, if you are playing games on the computer for hours, it can strain your eyes. this can cause you to feel tired and drowsy after being on the computer. also, statistics show that @percent of @caps own computers. could this be the cause of obesity in @location? computers could very well be restricting people from wanting to go outside and excercising to maintain a healthy lifestyle and weight. computers are obviously unfit for our bodies in many ways. have you ever wondered if the information on a website is completely accurate and true? i know i have. anyone who has access to a computer can post information on a blog, website, or communication site (such as twitter, facebook, or myspace). not everyone who posts articles is an expert on that topic; the information could very well be false! more and more @caps use computers to get the information they need, which could, in the long run, be hurting them. books are much more accurate! they have to be revised by editord, and are written by people who definitely know what they're talking about! therefore, computers are, without-a-doubt, hurting our nation because of false facts. lastly, computers have a negative effect because we rely on them too much! for example let's say you are writing a paper on the computer that is due tomorrow. you save it, and then close down the computer because you have to go eat dinnder. later, you come back to the laptop to find that your paper isn't there anymore! you look all over your folders; but it's gone. computers always have technical glitenes, but you don''t always have time to go to the tech help store to fix it. however, if you had written out the paper, it wouldn't have randomly disappeared! @caps people depend on computers too much, it can backfire and cause a @caps problem for you. my sixth grade teachers once said,  @caps i was in college, i had a big french paper due. i worked hard all night to get it done. then, @caps i went back to print it, it had been erased. i had to rewrite the whole thing again!  computers have a big negative effect on society because we tend to depend on them too much. in conclusion, computers are hurting our society, clearly, they are unhealthy for our bodies. also, the information on the computers internet might be naccurate. lastly, we rely on computers too much, which leads to problems. i strongly believe we should recluce our dependence on computers! 
8 dear @caps @caps, experts say,  @percent of @caps spend @num hours or more on the computer daily  the reccomened time limits is @num hour. by spending more time on computers people aren't exercising. secondly, those people aren't enjoying life and nature. lastly, the use of computer puts a strains on social skills between friends and family. surely the effects of computers cant be good. first off, people in this aren't exercising as much as they should. obesity and diabetes effects <@percent@num> of @caps. both of these diseases are lethal. if you spend so many hours on the computer these diseases wouldn't spread nearby as fast. when will you get off the computer for an hour and go outside or to the gym and exercuse so these won't affect you? secondly, nature is a marvelous thing. sure camping in a tent and catching dinner isn't for everyone. but, there are many ways to experience nature without  roughing it.  you can go to the or to the aquarium. sit on your back pond and go bird watching. all of these are great alternatives to sitting at the computer screen, looking at pictures of nature. lastly, people aren't spending enough time with family and friends. yes you can email, i. m., @caps, and @caps family and friends, but its not the as people are less and friendly then they. mainly of socia skills. we need to the of social without computer. in conclusion, computer do have a negative affect on people in the long tern. people aren't exersising. they aren't enjoying nature. finally their bonds between friends and family are weahiming. this is a growing problem which must be put to end. thank you for your time.
7 i think we need our computers. if we dont have competer's we wont be able to connect to our family that could live in anther state or country. i no how there is texting now but some people dont even have phones or nothing how can you connect to them you cant call it might not be free with the phone palan you have. if a family member coms and visits you they would probuly email you about it but if there is no computers they can't tell when there coming. are they gong do show unispectly they might not even be home and if they show up without them knowing there out of luck. and we exersize on our overtime we pick what time and we do it and if we play a sport were enjoying nature some people might have job's that take place outside of if. there are nerd's that are on computers all day long but in sure they enjoy nature i dont know about exersizing but they have a car and every thing they drive and things. also, about the exersizing every on has to exersize to stay in shape im pretty sure people dont want to be fat there whole life they want to look good and feel good about there self. if it is a holiday or something and people want to send them something to wish then of whetever holiday it is. there not gonna be able to see them in person if they live so far away inless they plan to meet each other but even if they do that there gonna want to email then not call were it costs money and texting only comes with sertain plan's of phones so all there is left is emailing. sometimes, people will more fron of you that your ollways on the computer if your not dont worry at least you get to email your family that you dont ever seen. these reasons are my opinion that dont get rid of computers and other things.
8 dear @caps i support that computers have a positive effect on people because they have so many things to do and learn on the computer, because on the computer you can look up many things like sports, animal world history and lot more. the reason i support this is because i like to look up history about @caps and @caps pioneer who have changed humanity. the @caps reason why i say computer effect people is because it teaches you how to type faster and know now to get certain places on the computer for example say you mom was asked you do you know how to get to a certain website to buy new furniture. @caps third reason of how computers effect people is if say one day you had to do a project, on what happen during @caps revolution and you were one of those people that spend all their time looking up @caps revolution on the computer. that means that project should be real easy. the @caps reason why i say computers affect people is because they teache better communicating skills on things like facebook and @caps, because when i'm in school kids tell each other to go on there facebook when they get home. i also think computer affect people because say you have a idol and wan't to look up that person for example i like football, basketball @caps idols are @person peterson and @person iverson, so everytime i go on the computer i look up both of @caps idols. @caps last reason why i say computers effect people are because they teach how to read because everytime on the computer haves something to read about no matter what it is.
7 i think computers work @caps because it helps people with there own work. but computers do make people addicted because you mostly could do anything but mostly computers were able to use for help like work, maps, friend to find ot problems like for school it helps htem with math, science, social studies and @caps of more things. but people abuse it like ther @caps games and their dont even go outside they don't talk to there friends or even see ther friends its mostly not haven a life. and people dont feel like going to school because their over and there tired and ther just want to use the computer all day with not stopping. and so i think that people are just to addicted to compulers they dont use it for the fright reasons. had then people get sick they could get hoadaks or they feel like puking. and they dont get to see that of things like go to the @caps, @caps football, soccer, @caps, valleyball or even take there own dog for a walk at the @caps. @caps of people buy computers for games and @caps or muture people buy computer for there work and find were places are so the computer helps @caps but it addicted @caps of people. and computers do really break @caps because people could download a game or something and then it gives it virus. so you mostly spend about @num $ or @num$ as fix it. and there new computers come and its like @num$ and @num$ and there different just from beand and ther go aboutmore faster. and whne people's computer break some go crazy and feel like doing some cordy stuff. ther does feel like they does friends they only stay at the room for every they never down out at all and if they do come out the room they instly dont respect there parents they do whatever they feel like doing and they they act into troubles with the . so computers do help out sometimes they dont but maybe should make different changes.
8 dear @organization @organization, have you seen someone with a @caps emailing their co-worker or a person with their laptop at a coffee shop? well, i can @caps i have and know they need and it benefits them. people everday use a computer for their work. also, you can keep in touch with friends and family. plus, it's the start to new improved future! whether you use a computer to get the latest gossip or for a job, the computer is now an important part of people's lives. my mother works on the computer everyday at her job, though it @month not seem important to you, it is to my family, who needs the money for food and bills. half of @location uses computer for jobs for money just like my family. recently, @organization, the computer company took a survey to see how many people use the company for work. a whopping amount of @percent use the computer for work. that @percent of people benefit from using the computer. they depend on their email to get to their boss or their layout of their statewide meeting to save so they can get the raise they deserve. you the, @organization even uses computers to write your articles for the paper. more than half of @caps or @organization benefit just from working on the computers. everyone says family is the most important thing right? what can yo do if they live far away? well you email, @caps, @locationm, or @caps of course. some experts @caps, people are spendiong too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family.  @caps is and was originally invented to keep in touch with family. so the experts have no reason to @caps that because people use the computer to keep in touch with families. even people in the army use the comptuer to communicate. using the computer isn't as bad as people think. look out! the future is coming! new technology greater than my knowledge is coming. computers were the start and people haven't stoped since. sure, of course the computer has a couple downsides. but what thing or invention doesn't. no one can stop what is coming, you just have to learn to live with it and move on. computers are the beginning to something good so don't stop something that could be even better! next time you go outside look for that guy in the business suit emailing on the @caps or the girl in the coffee shop and smile, know they are benefitting from it. whether it's for work or the one keeping in touch with a relative. maybe someone with the next big idea for the future. take a chance on the computer, stop the negativity and a pleasant surprise will come your way.
8 computers are used everywhere, for thousands of different things. many of @location spend hours glued to our computer screen everyday. being very reliant on your computer is not always good for you. @date too many people spend countless hours on their computers, rather than doing other activities. therefore, computers are not the best way to spend your time because you get less excersize, your school grades can lower, and your communication skills will weaken. first, when spending days on your keyboard you will have less time to run or play with your friends. in the @location @date, many more people are becoming obese, creating unhealthy genes to be passed on. perhaps a reason for this is that too many people can just sit on their laptops to shop, see movies, and even to get a college education. less and less people go for walks because they would rather be on @caps or @organization. without the constant use of computers there would be more free time for people to get outside, or play sports. secondly, many kids and teens are attached to their laptop, and bring it everywhere with them. so, rather than studying for their tests, they could be on @caps or @organization. must chose to go on @caps or @organization rather than opening their books. plus, spending so many hours on a computer. less time to do their homework, so they just begin to not do any of it. computers take away their time that could be used towards getting a college education, why waste them? lastly, why talk on the phone or in person when you can just send them an e-mail or chat online with them? many people @date are staying inside on their laptops to talk to a person rather than doing it face to face. this can cause a lack of communication skills, something that might sound good online, could sound absolutely terrible in the  real  world. this loss of skill, could lead to a generation of more cyber talk rather than @caps. in conclusion, why spend so many hours on the computer when you could be outside, or hanging out with friends? personally i'd prefer to go and do something rather than being stuck inside on a computer.
9 dear local newspaper, i believe that computers are effecting the lives of many people. more and more people keep getting sucked into the amazing things that computers can do and forget all about the other more important things in life. people should be exercising, and hanging out with friends and family, computers dont even teach you that much if you really think about it. people don't even realize that computers can take away very important things in life. fore istance, people aren't getting nearly as much exercise as they need. in this generation, more kids are overweight and obese that any other other generation. people get so caught up in what they are doing on the computer that they forget to exercise each day, or at least every other day. computers just add to list of excuses not to do anything. people already spend way to much time watching t.v. it rots your brain and studies acually show that people are less aware and less connected to the world and the people around them. computers are the same as t.v.'s, you say that your just going to be an for a minute and then next thing you know @num hours have already gone by. computers @month be exercising your brain, but they're not exercing you and that's what really counts. even if you were on the computer doing research for a school project, the computer still wouldn't help you. most people don't have the time to run out to the library to get the books that they need, so they just resort to the computer. that isn't the smartest idea because half of the websites that you click on or go to don't even have the correct information. you might look at it and read it, and even if it sounds good to you, that doesn't mean that it's right. next thing you know, you have a @caps or @caps on an assignment that the thought you aced. on top of getting false information, most people don't even know where to look to get the information that they're looking for. people just type what they are looking for into the google search box and press enter. then they just click on the first link that they see and use the information that is right on the page. then all of these different windows are popping up and you are far from where you were. people then just give up and start goofing off on the computer because they don't feel like trying to get back to that page. if people just went to the library and did research the old fashion way, then they would stop to notice all the things in life that they are missing out on. people should be focusing on family and friends rather than playing games on the computer. sure you can talk to people on the computer but you can't bond with them or really see what they are feeling. it's better to invite them over and have some fun playing board games or just talking in person for a change. even if your spending time with your family or friends you're probebly thinking about the computer the whole time that they are there, so go out and do something for change, a little fresh air wouldn't kill you. you should go to an amusement park, ride some rides with your cousins, do something that will keep your mind off the computer. people don't realize it, but after spending so much time with your family, rather than your computer, you will acually notice what you have been missing out on for so long. as you can see, computers aren't helping anyone. it's either not exercing, getting false information, or not spending time with your own family! seems to me that having computers around isn't everything that it's cracked up to be.
12 to whom @caps @month concern at @caps @caps @caps, @caps @caps's possible, imagine a world @caps computers, @caps drivers are bumping around and having difficulty watching the wheel and the road, phone bills are throughh the roof because of the whole world having no other way of communicating, and students are home worried sick that they don't have a book to study with. computers affect all of these areas of our lives. they teach hand-eye coordination, allows us to communicate with others dozens of ways, and let students learn and stay up-dated from their very own home. computers must stay a fundamental part of our every day. to begin, computers must remain in our community because they teach even young children hand-eye coordination. in a recent report the @organization states that in the past five years; the number of driving students who pass on their first try has almost doubled. the video games, the computer mice, and even typing the brain at a young age to work in sync with the body's arms, finger and other apend ages,  @caps's not only on the road where hand-eye counts.  says @person, head of surgery at @organization hospital.  @caps finding that younger doctors, ones that grew up on video and computer games, can form robotics surgery with much more presision than our older atendings.  @caps the coordination we aquire from the computer many jobs @month be out of reach, too. when saked, @num out of @num managers of local business said they would have someone who could type, over someone who couldn't. so, though you @month think computers teach no they can coordination for the rest of a persons life. secondly, computers should be part of homes because they allow people to communicate with others world. in a @date poll, only @percent of @num years old had, but a recent poll says that @percent now have e-pals. computer have opened to communicate e-mail, @caps, social networking sites, just to name a few! parenting @caps says that parents prefer there teens to e-mail trends or @caps as aposed to talk on the phone because @caps quiets the house, the phonelines for others and keeps phone bill low. my friend once only talked online for a month and her parents encourage her because the phone decreased by a third, @caps's clear that even though you @month feel that computers take up time that could be spent with others, @caps's actually a way to communicate with people everywhere. finaly, computers can help students learn. in todays schools, students depend on homework being posted online, and getting their books over the web. once, my brother didn't take home his book-bag for a week, and got all online. we was greatful for the strain off his back. when asked @percent of @num graders say they use e-books at least twice a week. the internet also is a valuable research tool. @num out of @num highschoolers say they use a book for researh less than once a month. as you can see, the internet is a valuable learning tool. in conclusion, computers help as with coordination, communication and education. computers have nothing but positive effects on people on society as a whole.
7 dear local newspaper, @caps to this article more and more people use computers, and the people who support advances in technology believe computers have a posotive effect on people. i disagree on you part. i believe that computers can ruin your life, and make you go blind. firstly, computers can ruind your life if. you stay on them for too long. computers is a little device that can almost let you do anything on it. the computer can let you look ups where your friends live, you can play tons of games ect. i remember this one time when i was watching channel @num news and a @num years kid fainted from playing a computer game for too long. see, i told you that they can ruin your life all it takes is a couple of hours to like the computer. secondly, computers can make you go blind because the screen of the computer is too close. the computer is built so you can do things on it, but unfortunatly the screen was screwed in too close so when you have to see something on your computer you literly have to stick your face on top of the screen. i remember one time when my dad bought a @organization, my dad was on that computer all day and when he got off it his eyes were blood shot, the mont after that he got glasses. see, i told you stickig you face too close to a computer screen can hurt your eyes. in conclusion, the computer can ruin your life and can make you go blind. the computer is bad for you, so you should stop and think about what i wrote in this persuasive letter.
8 dear newspaper @caps, even though there are good effects of computers on people, there are also many bad effects. some of the major bad effects of computers on people are no exercise, you can talk to strangers, and no interaction with family and friends. one of the effects of computers on people is no exersise. one of the most important effect of computers on people is no exersise. right now many people in the @location are obese because of bad eating and no exersise. one of the problems is that these people don'@caps get off their computers and couchs to go outside. these people choose to stay indoors and just do nothing except watch @caps.v. and go on the computer. so computers have a big effect on how these people live their lives. another problem caused by computers is kids talking to strangers. most kids in the @location are a member of a social network like @caps or @caps. there are people out there that go on these websites on their computers and pretend to be a teen. this can get many kids in trouble if they are not careful on these websites. since most people access these websites from their computers its another bad effect of computers on people. another bad effect is no iteraction with family or friends. when people are on computers, they focus on whats on the computer and not about their surroundings. being on the computer stops many people from interacting with their family and friends. not interacting with anyone causes their social skills to weaken since they are always on the computer. this can become a serious problem if a person becomes too adicted to the computer. this can cause many problems between communication throughout the family making the family weaken. in conclusion even though there are good effects of computers on people, there are also many bad effects which can cause serious problems. computers can cause tragaties in families and/or in that persons's life.
8 @city @caps: i believe that computers (for now) are a good thing for our society. they allow you to see places. if you have a long distance relationship you can talk to them and they have many good excessories. what if you were looking for a new home? you could use google to search of selling homes in a certain location. then finding some one to move your stuff for a fair price. computers have many websites that you can go to when looking for that special place. the computer is also handy when you are going on vacation. you can look up the weather for that time. if you are going somewhere for, you can use the computer to find a plane. computers are helpful when it comes to places! the excessories on the computer are endless. one big excessory that people like to do is games. games are great to get your mind going. practically all of the grades require hand-eye coordination. for example, @organization. you need to remove all the tiles before the time runs out! if you are bored, games are very fun. i think that games are a great excessory. some people have long distance relationships right? well, if you have a computer you can have an online. this relieves many people when they know your not there. if you have an email, you can talk  to your friends that you dont see at school. this gives you a chance to connect with them. myspace and facebook are very similar. these are what you can use to talk to your friends at school. computers are very useful. as you can see, i have stated many good reasons. excessories,  talking  to people. also, places. many people use computers in their every day life. computers are awsome! 
2 i think that computers are amazing. computers are an amazing way to meat new pol online.
10 some  experts  are warned that people should spend too much time on their computers. yet, look at all of the advantages to a computer. you can develop better hand-eye coordination skills, internet with friends/family who could live hundreds of miles away, and you can learn about cultures all around the world, along with the people who live in those countries, without ever leaving home. in my oponion, computers overall benefit society, helping us learn more & more every day. first off, there are many skills you can develop on the computer. for example, when playing interactive high-paced games, kids get a sense of awareness timing, and hand-eye coordination. not to mention, with new advances in technology, people can now go to college without ever leaving home, and at a much lower price, while still getting a great education. many people even work from home, thanks to their computers. these are still only a few of the many skills that can be learned on computers. secondly, why buy a ticket to a far away country that's fairly expensive, trade in all your money for the money they have there, go through the hasslels of baggage, ect. when you could simply go online and look it up on the computer? you can go online, look up some of that countries recipes, language, pictures, people without the hassel of going there. not to mention, for kids who aren't old enough to @location, or have to do a report on it, instead of making through countless textbooks, newspapers, libraries in general, they go online, @caps their country, and they have must, if not all the info they need right there. so not only is getting the information then you would've learned in the first place, thereby, extending your knowledge. finally, the internet helps people connect. leading experts from the @caps.s.a., or family security agency, says that since people have started using programs like @organization and facebook, many more families, who live in different countries, have been able to re-coonect and get to know one-another. for example, if you have an uncle who lives in @location, you could both buy cameras for your computer, install them, and within minutes, be seeing each other/talking face to face. i think this is better then simply writing letters to them, as it's quicker, and you get to connect more. same goes if a friend or you move away, but want to stay in touch. a quick facebook account or @organization, and you'll still be good friends. so all in all, yes, computers do benefit society, as they help teach people skills, learn about distant cultures/far away countries, and connect people, who might live in different countries. i don't see anything wrong with these beneficial factors to society. so yes, computers have a positive effect on people.
12 dear local newspaper, @caps a world filled with gargantuan people seated at a moniter, their eyes staring at it blankly. outside the city streets are deserted, save for the squirils running along fence posts. this is what will happen if people spend to much time on the computers. people will spend less time exercising, less time outdoors enjoying nature, and less time interacting with family and friends. this is why computers have a drastic negative affect on people. first of all, people send huge amounts of time on their computers and small amounts of time exercising. in a recent poll done by @organization magazine, it stated that @percent of people between the ages of @num and @num prefer to be online rather than outside exercising. that article also states that since @date, child obesity has increased by @percent! @person of @organization at @organization states that   the reason child obesity has increased so much is because children spend so much time in front of the computer and less time outdoors. do you want this rate to increase in the next ten years? secondly, spending so much time inside decreases the time you spend outside enjoying nature. bird watches monthly has had a decrease in subscriptions the @date because people are not interested in nature anymore. in a study done by @person and his collegues at @organization, @caps of @caps spend almost @percent more time indoors infront of electronic devices, most frequently computers, then they do out doors. @person says,  @caps to the new advancements in technology, people are to spend more time indoors than outdoors and that percentage will most likely increase as the decade proceeds . finally, spending so much time in front of the computer leaves you less time to interact with family and friends. in @date more than @percent of family ate dinner together now, only @percent eat together usually because they are in separate rooms in front of a moniter. this also leads to higher crime rate, believe it or not. because young children and adolescents don t have the person to support and guide them because they don t spend time together @caps to the frequent use of computers, there is a @percent chance that child will commit a crime compared to the @percent chance a child would in @date. do you want that for our youth? now @caps a world where people jog together in the park, as they jog, they see a group of bird watchers huddled together under a tree. as the joggers proceed, they come to a pavilion and see a big family celebrating the @date of a family member. this happy thought won t become a reality if people spend too much time on their computers and less time exercising ,enjoying nature, and less time interacting with family and friends. so, local newspaper i encourage you, to encourage others, to get outside and spend less time infront of the computer. you have the power to make a difference in your real lives. but the question is, will you?
8 you must be insane! computers are very important to society. my first reason is, computers can be used for research. secondly, can be made. lastly, you can talk and video chat. these are my three reasons why computers are important to society. if you want to know more send on. firstly, computers can be used for research. for example, what if your boss wats to find the of products ? all you have to do is go to www.google.com, and look it up! is is that easy. also what if you need to do reasearch on @organization for school? instead of reading books about him, you can type in his name, and theres your information. in @caps @num out of @num kids/adults use the computer for research. this is my first reason. secondly, purchases can be made. what if you would like to buy a plane ticket to @location to help? you can go on the computer and buy a ticket at your convenience. you can order order all types of that needed to @location. or that a relative/friend can have a. how way simplier than going out and doing it yourself. this is my second reason. lastly you can talk and video chat. you own a other people, and you all in diffreent country need a a video meeting. what if you have relatives that live far away that you miss alot? you can have a video family. this is my last reason. i hope you consider my reasons why computers are very important to society.
6 you say that computers are bad and does not help any one in these physical life but some people go on the computer to find yoga poses and diest tips and how does that not help them physicaly and mentaly. computers they @month get kid in a lot of trouble they chat on (@caps, facebook twitter, etc...) but they also don't know whos behind the computers they spend so much time on that @caps thing. that they don't attention to life itself. now there are good parts about the computer you can find things you need and you can check travel sites etc... so you can not say that the computer is all that bad it helps a lot of people. so you should really be consider judging the skills of the computer they really do help in life. and they do help people that have physical needs.
8 dear newspaper, in my opinion, i believe that kids and adults spend more than enough the on their computers i can see how it benefits you in some ways but it keeps you away from halwe, being outdoors and excersizing. it also can have an effect on your eyes in your later life. people go on @organization, @location, and @caps search engines and a little more than half those site's results are fuke. and the more people go on computers, the easier it is to yet caught pladurizing and that is a big thing in the community. those are some ideas, but i have some more don't worry and details to go along with those ideas. people need fresh air, excersize for their body and to enjoy the outdoors. you can do all of that stuff if you just get off the computer. and instead of searching the places online and what their all about, just go visit them. you will get fresh air, excersize and experience. and after having that experience you will pass it on, teh real to ohter people will not get any of hot fake stuff. for example, you can search @caps online and they just have pictures food. but if you take visit there you will get to really last the food. would you rather being sitting in a chair, staring at the computer, or having fun outdoors visiting places you have never seen before? you will never get or learn anything by pudurizing plus you will get than and get clicked. but if you think a little or maybe had experience with your writing tool, then you will learn and. that is also because kids are too lazy to it out because they are not outside doing things and they're inside and used to they becausethey are so their computer all the time. i guest i also agree with using computers because they give you skills they going to places don't give you. like, you also need skills, mainley, hand-eye coordination for typing the long papers for collage and those skills will get you for in life. it's like a chain reaction, you type on the computer a lot, you will have good hand-eye coordination if you have good hand-eye coordination, you will do good in school, and it goes on. and you end up being successful. another benefit with computers is the sales, more and more people are buying computers which helps the economy so i guess i agree but my opinion will stay strong with not using computers. so wether you have a computer or not, if you dont i prefer not to get one, but get off your bum and do some excersizing and visit those topical islands you always visit.
8 dear @caps, @caps people are using technology. a lot of them feel that it is helping and improving their learning ability, others disagree. i personally feel that computers are an advantage but also disadvantage. i say it can be an advantage because it is giving people a chance to experience above and beyond what they are learning. i say it is a disadvantage because a lot of people are on the computer and they don't get a lot of exercise. there are pros and cons to computers but manly cons. how long do you stay on the computer? @caps people find computers more entertaing than going outside and getting some exercise. since technology is advancing, more and more people are going out to buy computers. a lot of teenagers are spending more and more time on the computer, playing games and going on their favorite websites. that is one reason why children from the ages @num and up are obese. they don't get enough exercise. that also leads into people spending time with your friends and family. i know alot of people like to spend time with their friends and family. but what if you were always on the computer and never made time to hang out with your friends or family. your friends might ask you to go to the park with them, and you say no. your friends are going to start pulling away from you. you might end up being lonely. being on the computer constantly can ruins your life. if you are choosing the computer over other important thing, then i think we have a problem. going on the computer all the time can became an addiction. i don't think people realize it, but it can. i can take over your life. i say this because when you have an addiction to anything, it is hard to stop. it is possible to stop all by yourself but thats rare. majority of the times it is best to seek help, i personally think you should take all of these reasonings into consideration.
6 dear @caps, i am writing to you to inform you that i agree with the followings said on the writing prompt. first, i will be talking about how people  use computer too much. secondly, i would talk about people who talk online way too much. lstly, i would say spending to much time on their computers. to start, people that use computers too much. first, people like to go on things such as myspace, secondly people like playing online games. alstly, some people like to gosep to others online. for example, if you go to soemones house you are always going to see a young kid or a parent online somewhere or playing online gmaes. also, peopel talk online way too much. first, they go to face book all the time. secondly, they got ,myspace which you can get your identity stolen. lastly, kids love to go on myspace it's the smae as myspace. for example, peopel might come to you and say do you have a so and so and sya can i get your eamail address. certainly, spoending too much time on their computers is bad. first, kids might have problems online and to keep the problem to get worst. secondly, might be argueing with a friend. lastly, might nit be active but live playing or going other online websites. so @caps did you start to agree with why people should get active outside and have fun. in conclusion, this was why i agreed with beign active because being on the computer all day would get your and hard use too being on the computer @num. 
6 the people who are concerned about the bad on computers are right about a couple things, but good does come out of it like what is the miltary needs recruits for the army they can post up their ad on the computers that everyone will see, and what the people who drop out of school and they want a second chance they can appily for scholl online. my last reason is what those people who have a hard finding work they always look up the best job for them over the internet. read more to find out how the internet is good for society. first, as the army keeps losing more and more soldiers in combat and they try to recruit people they can post their ad up over the internet. sure they can mail it out but that would take forever for people to find out about it and learn about it. for example, they can post the ad up on myspace and have thousands of people looking at it in minutes. finally, the internet is a great way for the miltary to recuit soldiers. next,
6 dear @caps, @caps has come to my attention that people are spending to much time on computers, and i agree because people spend so much time on computers that @caps gets addicting, people don t get enough exersize, and eyesite gots worse. so please keep reading my letter and i will tell you the side effects of the computer. most of all @caps gets really adicting for a lot of people that they dont spend time with thie familys or sibleings and some kid get so adicted that they come from school and start useing the computer all day and dont study for a test or do home work. now people spend so much time on the computer that they dont exersize or play sports with thier friends and just sit all day and get lazy and fat just because of the computer. we just need the computer just to chek @caps and facebook like i do but i just check my facebook and the go play basket ball. one of the biggist problem that i think is when you sit on the computer to long and get a head ache and ruins your ey site. so thank you for reading my letter and hope you agree with me.
7 my opinion is that people spend to much time on computers and don t concentrate on their family. another reason is that people will not do school work if their to concentrated on the computer. my third reason is people wont enjoy hanging out with there friends. those are my reasons now let me explain them. first, people will be concentrated on the computer and not their family. they will be focused on the computer way to much and not have fun with there family and friends. people ignore their parents when on computer. i know this because my sister goes on the computer and completely ignores my mom and dad when there talking to her. please heed my advice or your kids will be ignoring you when you are talking to them. @percent of children go on the computer and ignore everything. now i can advance to the next reason. second of all, peop concentrate to much on the computer that they dont do homework or any school work. if they dont do homework they could get bad grades on their report cards. if they get bad grades they could fail the marking period and stay back. please listen or your child could stay back. now for my third reason. third, people wont enjoy hanging out with there friends. on the weekends you wouldn't want to be on the computer go out with your friends, enjoy yourself.
9 today in our society almost everyone uses computers weather @caps to do research, play games, or interact with others. these are all positive things. the schools across america are using computers from @num grade to online colledges. people benefit from computers by getting everything and anything done from them. @caps anyone who has a brain can relize that computers are a positive in todays society. first off computers are a positive thing because they can get almost anything done for you. you can play on them, and interact with others the reason that the computer being able to get almost anything done for you @caps a good thing because if you need to get work done you can do that if you need research @caps can do that and @caps can help you in any subject. the reasons that playing games can be positive @caps @caps does not only give you great hand eye cordonation but @caps also exersises you brain and can be a learning for young children. the reasons that interacting through the computer @caps that you learn how to be and talk through email for buisnesses and,make many @caps pleases use your brain and that computer our society today. @caps to keep on going americans are the smartest people in this world and our very well. i @caps have to you like and that @caps why we send every one of them to school @num of every year. will that said they use computers anyone to say that computers are bad the that you love do while this. that useing computers and benifiting your life. @caps as you can see that computers are a thing for the good and can benifit to days saciety @caps i beg you for your sake please use computers and benifit your life. its for your own good.
9 dear local newspaper, i agree that computers have an effect on people. it helps people learn hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn a far places and you can talk online with other people. computers teach hand-eye coordination. as @caps grow up, they learn about letters of the alphabet and spelling. there are many online programs that teach @caps how to type. once the @caps get in learning how to type, they end up typing fast. computers help @caps of future learn & with all these learning websites, @caps will be able ti teach them solves new things. isn't it a blessing to be able to meet people from a far? you'll get ot learn there cultures. would you want to know something about? they make daily go around, there you'll you? well its so learning a new culture is a faster way of making friends. have you connect. oneday i will people who dont just want to be friends, maybe more than that. be positive about online chatting, or online dating services. as you can see for my reasons above, the computer has an effect on people. the computer teaches you hand-eye coordination, it also gives you the ability to learn afar places & people, and it allows you to chat with other online people. make sure you stay positive & be safe on the computers.
10 dear to whom it @month concern, @caps name is @person, and i feel computers are bad for society. computers have been the big difference when comparing @num to @num centuries. people have come to rely too heavily on computers. the communication globally has not been very helpful and people are spending hours on their computers every day instead of exercising. on the whole i feel society would be better off without computers. at the end of @date before the millenea would take place everyone feared what was called @num. the year two thousand would supposedly be when all computers shut down and didn't work. computers were at their beggining for society so everyone thought they were great. people were panicing over the thought of their precious computers not working. the entire nation had become reliant on computers. everyone hid in attics and basements waiting for the world to end. do you know what happened? the sun came out the next day and everyone logged onto their emails with a sigh of relief. not only relief for the world not ending but for the life of computers to be able to go on. people still rely on computers just as much more today. i recently visited @location and in a rest every where the even had their laptop that they had to take everywhere with them. in conclusion the @caps society is at a sad state with how much they rely on computers. a fast instinct is to say communication when you why humans need computers. why is that? we have telephones. is there nation television channels? we have plenty of means of communication, such as ways like maybe writing a letter to someone? communication would not be a problem in fact it has mainly caused trouble. computers and internet allow news to be spread quickly even if it isn't free, damaging someones carrer and publicity. they also allow communication with foreign countries. exess communication that can get countries into wars. normally the @location would have no idea whats going on but with internet the nation is involved quickly. computers breed had communication and you can easily communicate other ways with family and friends. since i am a teen i also know the problems with youths and computers. often times kids don't want to go outside and istead sit inside on the computer. obesity is a rising issue in @location and kids need to exercise. kids also dislike going on trips like camping outings because they don't want to leave their computer. without computers kids would get more exercise and be less overweight. now you have seen @caps reasoning that society would be in much better if there were no computers.
6 dear local newspaper, @caps my opinion on this is that people do use computer's a lot! some people don t care about exercising, or enjoying nature, maybe people dont even have friends so they spent a lot of there time on the computer because they have no life or maybe they just go on websites that are addictive. for example @caps.com, people/kids have one of those? they chat with friends or maybe even boyfriends. enyways thats my opinion. another opinion is that i think people should not spend most of there time on the computer. i think that because people should be having fun, socializing with people, and living there life! so this is what i i think, my opinion about  computers .
8 dear @caps, i feel like computers are good for you in a lot of ways. like computers sometimes keep kids out of the street so they wont get in trouble. the computer has a lot of games you ran play on so it would keep you doing something. computers also have something called microsoft and microsoft is something that help you do writing projects and things like that. computers help a lot of people cause like i said earlier it has games and some of those games have to do with school such as science, math, reading, and social studies so it is very helpful. computers are also bad for people like you because when you go on it most teens liketo go on something called myspace. myspace is a thin that you can have freinds all around the world and can talk to them and put pics of yourself on it. if you go on myspace and have friends from different state or the same state you that they world want to find you and rape you. they would start a conversation with you like they would ask you for your name and where you live. another reason its bad is because when @num graders go to the middle school @num grader will tell the inaproperate websites and the little kids would go on it and will get in trouble. well you heard my opoin i hope you understand thank.
8 dear @location press, i believe that computers have a terrible impact on society, the reason i believe this is true is that kids can go  braindead  as some people call it. also kids can get obese witch is already a greatly growing process. the last reason is that kids get bad eye sight from it. the first reason i believe that computers have a bad impact on our society is that all kids do is sit there and eat while they are on the computer and they get an addiction to it so they just keep getting fatter because they arn't getting any exercise. this problem with children getting fat is already a very brought up topic and with something like this out it's not going to get any better any time soon. studies show that @percent of kids who are on the computer more than a hour and a half a day are actually going braindead. this means that if this becomes the new trend for all kids that our next generation will not be smart and won't be able to keep up with other countries and fall behind, so we have to do something about this trend setting issue if you want our country to stay in one piece. the last but not least reason is kids are forming a bad eye sight. this can also bad for future generations. if you let this catch on the generation will all need glasses its almost like a domino effect. these are all the reasons that computers have a bad impact on the society. kids get obese, they go braindead, and they develop bad eye sight from it.
7 dear local newspaper, i believe that computers have a positive effect on people because it teaches hand-eye coordiantion. you can also learn about different people and places. but it also allows us to communicate with the people online. computers have a positive effect on people because it teaches hand-eye coordination. because it's rely important to have hand-eye. and when your out in the world you rely need to be able to look at something and pick it up or say if you get into a altercation with someone. so it's rely important to have hand-eye. another reason why i feel computers have a posative effect on people is because you could learn about diffrent stuff over the internet. like learning about far away places and people. so the internet is giving you a great opportunity to learn more about or earth, other than your back yard. so technacally it's preparing you for life. my final reason why i think the computer has a posotive effect on people is because it allows people to talk to other people who are online. like say you dont have a phone but you have a computer and you need to tell something very important to someone; you could do it online. and people say it's one of the fastest pieces of technology known to mankind to people who need it. those were my three reasons why i believe the computer has a posotive effect on people. and if you don't believe me go hop on a computer and see for yourself. you won't be dissapointed.
9 dear local newspaper, it has came to @caps attention that many people do not agree if computers have a beneficial or bad affect on those who use them. in @caps oppinion they are not beneficial. first when on the computer people have less time to exercise. also, computers don't always have approprate sites. finally, people have less time to interact with family and friends. i believe for these reasons that computers have bad affects on people. without a doubt people who spend hours on the computer everyday have less time to excersice @num in every @num young adults are obiese. this is because most teens sit inside watching @caps or going on the internet instead of being active. some students are so addicted to computers they never go outside! i understand that computers can be helpful to do school work but, kids who never get off can have life threatening weight problems in the future. as you know many web sites that are not appropriate for teenagers are accesible to them on the computer. parents have to constantly worry what their child/children are doing just to make sure it is not bad. if less teens used computers as often as they do they would be lifting a nof their parents shoulders. i remember reading a newspaper article about a girl named @person on a website chatting with a  @num year old guy who later came and found her and turned out to be @num. if kids were not so addicted to the computer than they wouldnt get into these websites. many teens spend there whole day on the computer leaving no time for their family and friends. for example when a friend calls and asks @caps brother to go skateboarding he says he is busy when he is just on facebook, @caps friend once said to me  sorry i can't go to the pool today i am going to play rollercoaster tycoon.  with this attitude toward outdoor activities i am not surprised that students wasting time on computers do not have time for family or friends. as you can see computers effect many people in a negative way. they prevent people from ecersising, expose kids to in approplate websites, and take away from valuable time with family and friends. i hope everyone agrees thet computer aren't beneficial to people.
10 dear @caps @caps, i would like to notify your business that computers benefit society. computers allow people to talk to friends and family, they are important resources for many jobs as well as school work, and they allow people to learn and store information. computers are one of the biggest advances we have in technology. first and foremost, computers allow people to talk to friends and family. i like to go on the computer, mostly because i'm able to speak with my friends. computers are a good way to talk to friends that you @month not see often or just to talk at the appropriate time. i have a facebook and i always talk to my friends about events happining in school or school work. for instance, last month i sprained my ankle and i stayed home from school for one day. so i went on facebook at around @time, when everyone was home from school and my friend told me what was for homework that night. so, now because of our computers i could catch up on the work that i missed that day of school. also, if you have family that lives far away or someone in college you can send them an email to keep in touch. my cousin is in college right now and i always talk to him on the computer to see how he is doing. for example, we always talk about sports we are involved with during that time of year. as you can see, computers are a great way to keep in touch with family and talk to friends. secondly, computers are a big part of many peoples lives because many jobs involve computers; as well as school. computers are a very useful piece of technology because people use computers for paying bills, jobs and more. for example, my dad tests computer programs as a job. the programs are constructed, then corrected and revised, then finally sent out all over the world. if people weren't allowed to use computers then many people would lose their jobs and many families would be in huge debt. also, children do a lot of school work on the computer. for example, i take spanish and i earn culture points for my class by answering a question on the computer. studies show that over @percent of children use computers for some sort of school work. computers are a big part of the working society today. finally, computers allow people to learn about different places around the world. the computer holds a lot of valuble information. there is facts and fasinating pictures about different countries. it also shows people around the world the culture, style, language and many more facts about places around the world. for instance, my uncle was on the computer one day and he was looking at places in @location and after a long hard thinking process him and his family moved there and they still live there to this day. computers inspire people to learn and see different places and @month lead them to something important one day. in conclusion, i feel very strongly about how positive computers are to society today. i know that you will feel the same way because computers have so much to offer.
7 dear local newspaper, i think that computers are a great thing to have. for instance they are entertaining, they have communication, and they help make designs. my first reason is that computer are entertaning. i hate to go look at nature. but i love to play videogames on my computer. i still get my exercise though, because i go out and play basketball then play on my computer. the computers are still a good thing though because after @caps done with basketball, hanging out with friends, or if its raining i like to play some good old gun blasting computer games. my second reason is that you can comunicate with computers. i love to talk to my friends on facebook. you can just login and talk to anyone in the world. there is also video chat you can actually see someone who is talking to you from anywere. plus email is great for work. you can send information from one computers to the other. my last reason is for designs every modern car that you drive, is originally from a computer. people get on these computers and make blue print designs to make cars. these are my reasons that computers are good.
8 dear (newspaper), this is a very controversial topic. i am discussing. but on this one, i must say i agree with the experts when they say computers have a negative effect on people. it ruins their social lives, and other bad things. if you spend all your time on the computer, you get no exercise, no fresh air, and you will not get to experience the rest of the world. not recieving your daily exercise is a big problem. obesity has already been an issue for millions people in the @location and it is mostly because they eat unhealthy snacks while sitting at the computer the whole day! you want to live a long and healthy life, don't spend all your time having your eyes give to a screen. in adition everyone needs fresh air, right? going on the computer inside a room is not going to help at all. you need your daily intake of oxygen. lastly, if you are on long enough, enough, it will become an obsession. computers already have a bad effect on people all around, and just think about what has just been mentioned. another problem computers have is that they keep you away from your family and friends. as mentioned before, the social life you had will be gone. with that in mind, people will always see you on the computer, and eventually get sick of you. computers bring no adventures, just pictures of them. going out into the real world might be hard, but it is something that should be done. a real life cannot be lived in a dark room with no people or no nature. haven't you always wanted to travel around the world, see different types of cultures, lifesyles, etc? it gets to the point where computer use should be limite, and living your life should be in place of your free time. using a computer all day will not let you meet new people, and see new places. you will sbe getting nowhere with a computer screen in your face, so put it away! in conclusion, using computers all the time restrict you from exercising, getting fresh air. meeting new people, and seeing different places all over. at the end up the day, life is short, so you can't aford to waste it. computers have a negative effect on everbody, and hopefully someday these problems will be changed!
8 dear @person, i'm sending you this letter on the behalf of the people that spend way too much time on computers. some people @month say that you learn different cultures and interact with new people everyday. the truth is that a computer doesn't help you; in fact it hurts you. by spending all day on the computer you will get fat, lose great experiences on the outside and miss out on life. as a whole @location is known as an obese country. this is due to the fact that most people eat and then dont exercise. most of these obese people don't exercise because they are glued to thier computer. while interacting with others they just keep on eating, most dont even know why they're eating. if we want to erase @location as being an obese country, then we must get people away from their computer screens. it is actually our fault, because we aren't making a stand. we must show people just how bad the computer really is. also, while people are on the computer they're missing out on the world. they won't go outside, they wont know what the real world is actually like. imagine cthat being an adult and having no clue about the outside world. also, the could miss out on life changing exercises the kind of experiments that people @caps, they would miss out on life as a whole. we only have one life, so you better enjoy it. it would be so sad for someone to just pass through life being stuck on your computer screen. i truly feel bad for that person, then again it could be fixed. all that we have to do is take away the computer. if we do this then all the problems will be solved. finally, if we get rid of computers we will be known as a new nation. free from temptation and independent human beings. we will rewrite ourself in history as the that made a chane and got rid of computers.
8 dear local newspaper, i am writing this to let you know that many people are spending to much time on computors rather than enjoying nature. people say advances in technology believe that computers have an effect on people in such a way of saying. many people showed on as is say can use the computers but to remember to think about nature what nice things it has in store for us. im going to saying that experts are right that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. im thinking that in some points many family members and friends see then other relative person on companion so much on the computers it's like if they are thinking maybe they don't care anymore. caring about nature and your loved ones is such a great thing. @percent of my friends agree with me when i say that people should be less on electronic devices because that can effect your brain or maybe your eye sight (eye vision.) @caps more and more people should lay off it. @person of yale university has conducted extensive reaserch and proven that many computers that are being used by people can be damage of using it every time. i strongly agree with him that there should be a time limit on something to let them later on have the spaare time to enjoy and have fun with nature but something different such as to enjoy listening to soft music. i know you will agree with me when i say that maybe people should spend less time effecting themselves. whatsoever im hoping from you to agree with my position so this can be possible to break this habit of going on computers and having no time for your family and friends is not such a to start off with.
8 dear newspaper @caps, @caps opion in thig is that, computer are used all the time. people use them to talk to friends and family online. people also use computers for home work online. and the last rason i say computer are used is just for fun stuff game you can play. i use the computer to look how @caps teams are doing. now on to more about why. computers are good for society, because people use computers to talk to friends and family on @caps, @caps and @caps. this is a good reson becuase we all have family. so i think that this is a good way to talk to them. an for friends this is a good way because if they move you can talk to them on this. the reson it a bad thing is because people like older men can use the computer for child pornarapy and talk to younger girls about sex and thats not right. now on to more about using computer for homework. the reson computers are good to us is because people can use there computers for homework. this is good because if you need to do something on our history then that what thats good for this is good because everything you need is on a computer. now on to more about how computer are good to society. @caps @caps reson is because computer are good for fun stuff. computer can have every game you want they have kid games, @caps @num year old sister goes on to the games that you can match. teenagers can play games on the computer. the compter for me is cool because i can see how @caps football team is doing. ho @caps @caps are doing. this is why the computer are good. these are @caps opion on this is that compter are used all the time peopl use them to talk to frend and family online. peope also use computer for homework. finally last and @caps reson is because you can use it for fun games for kids. an i can check how @caps teams are doing. 
10 dear @caps @caps, @caps computers hold exclusive inofrmation, i do not believe the have a good effect on people. the majority of students today crowd around a computer while they can be taking care of their body. such as excersising or just going outside. people need to enjoy the wonders of nature instead of sitting on a computer. not only will computers impact people, but it @month also impact family in friends. there will be less interacting time a risk by going on a computer. different websites can expose the wrong thing and get you into trouble. i firmly believe that computers have hamble affects on people. in @location today, we are already loaded with obese poeple. @num outof @num people are not physically healthy and a majority of obese people today state that they do own a computer. computers attract people and same @month sit at the computer for hours at a time what about excersising or enjoying the outdoors? computers damage our bodies in a way by luering ourselves in while we can go out and enjoy nature. i definatly will argue this fact that computers have a bad effect on humans. computer change not only the body, but mind. my sister has a computer in her bedroom and i barely see her at all. she stays up there all the time, and when my mom calls for dinner, it takes more than five @caps to get her away from her computer. computers affect people because they keep humans away from civilization. friends and family are impacted by the lack of interaction from one person. it's disrespectful to take time away from your friends to play on computers. this ruins many peoples social health, because the more they ignore their family or friends, these people will stop trying to interact with them. when these computer finatics came around, there want be anyone there for them. computers definatly have an unhealthy affect on people who use them. how would you feel if tons of your personal info got out into the public. nowadays, computers have a major chance to do that to you. websites like @caps, mysapce, or twitter have your information, and with a click of a button, it can be exposed to the world. computers have a background of doing this kind of effect on people. some dont understand what they are doing and if bad info or a picture sends out, it can fully negatively impact your career or edecation. computers help people to make wrong choices and there is no doubt people should let up on the time they spend on the internet. many agree, computers disadvantage many people in their own way. whether it is by taking their health away because it keeps many indoors, or if it costs you your friends and family, computers are not good for your physical and social health. computers can send out information and they are risky. they will majority impact your future and impact all people in a bad way.
8 the effects of computers to people are that adults and kids are getting way more attention then they need to. the first reason why is that most spend their time social networking. the others are either buying things or playing games. some of the people that are on the computers are wasting too much time being tech-saavy. it's other ways people can spend their time like biking or taking a brisk walk. another solution is you can get up on you learning skills or find a job around you town. computers drain and waste peoples minds everyday. i think it is essential for the people that can't get off seek fitness and mental health. than again it could be legitimate reasons to be on the computers spending as much time as you want. the people that abuse the access of their computer too much should think and find something else to do. i think it'll be a good idea to have a time when the computers should be shut off one day or a week. by that i mean the cable/enternet company should turn the internet and the cable off for a week of pure exercise. that'll make people who are lazy to do something active. it'll also be a good motivator for people who are on the computer or watching t.v too much. then it would make everybody fit and health if they try. i understand the elderly or senior citizens who need their computers for health help. that's understandable but everyone else should not be exempt. computers and laptops should be network disconnected to make people get off their feet and do something helpful or brain building. everyday people are being digitally sucked in. some people in this world just can't get enough of it and it need to dead soon. the government should make a legal law that you must do something that will actively benefit you. it should be a person of the state or local towns person that goes to every house. another way that could be done is by one person from every street in the state go home-to-home to make sure the procedure is being done. a lot of people are not going to like it and they will not obey the new law. it should be a penalty towards anyone that fails to abide by it. the second choice should be a loss of internet services. that'll make them really mad and in exchange they should still exercise. sometimes it takes harsh laws to make somebody change.
9 more and more people are using computers on a daily basis, but i do not agree that this benefits our society. people are spending too much time on computers and less time exercising and healthy. also people using computers are spending less time with family and friends. as people use computers more they are spending less time excersising and staying healthy. profesor @person has done a study showing that people who are on the computer for more than @num hrs a day are overweight and do not excersise regularly. he goes on the state that if these habits continue throughout their lives they will become obeast and are more likely to die from a heart attack before age @num. i have experienced changes in my communities health due to computers as well, last year i had a friend who weighed @num lbs and exercised regularly but when he got a computer that folowing year he stopped exercising and gamed over @num lbs he now is much slower and can not do more than push ups. i do not agree that computers are benefiting our society because as people use computers more they exercise less causing them to be unhealthy. not only do computers less on unhealthy life style, it also causes spend less time with family and friends. studies show that @percent of children that their our computer spend less time with their family and more time on the computer. this @month not seem like a thing at but this study also shows that @percent children who spend less time with their familieis grow up to become lonely and kill themselves due to depresion. i remember when a new came to our school from he wasn't that kid and didn't many friends he was still doing just fun but when he came back the next year started and i found out he had at the end of he school and keep in touch with an of his friend and to his parents. so far that week of from the rest of the students and don't much. then the we got back the @date he wasn't at school and for the rest of the week he didn't show up either and finaly on @date and teachers told us he ran away from and has still not been found. so people that use computers are spending less time with their family and friends which can cause them to become depressed and lonely. more and more people are using computers daily basis, but i do not agree that this is benefiting our society. people are spending to much in their computers and are spending less time excersising and staying healthy. also people using computers are spending less time with their family and friends. i know that the more people using computers is not better for our society it is worse.
11 dear i think computers greatly benefit society, and advance technology. they provide knowledge in a click, and entertainment after a long day out work or school. not only that, but people have found long-lasting careers because of the invention of the computer. so obviously, computers are a great influence on society. do you want to find out when major legue baseball first came to be? or maybe you have a history report due the next day, and your parents can'@caps drive you to the library? this isn'@caps a problem anymore. computers have evolved a long way since they were invented in the @num's. you can check up on your local news, by having @num's of electronic newspapers right at your fingertips. or maybe you want to venture outside your neighborhood, and check out what's happening in @location or @location. news isn'@caps the only thing the internet is useful for though. you can also go onto one of the @date's of websites for school help, or check how the stock market is doing. or, you can just use the handy calculator found right on your desktop. what could be better? of course not all users have a computer for information. many have it for entertainment purposes. in fact @percent of people use the computer for entertainment everyday. what, with all the fun stuff you can do, who can blame them? social networking is placed at the top of the list. a whopping @percent of internet users use sites like @caps or @caps. these sites are useful for catching up with friends you might not have seen in years or continue a conversation from @num minutes ago. you can also use computers to watch live-streaming @caps.v, or that new @caps you got yesterday. that's right, @caps.v's might not be needed soon! and what would a compter be without games? there are @num's of @date's of them scattered all across the web. how great is that? and finally, many people have found their careers through the internet. did you know that @person, @num, was found through you tube when his mom posted videos for the family to see when they couldn'@caps attend proformances? of couse, you tube isn'@caps the only way to make money. tons of jobs are listed by employers only for the curious person to find. no more wondering city streets, now you can just submit on aplication or have an interview without ever leaving your. artists have also discovered talents, by playing around with @caps or @caps. not to mention the career paths involving computers directly, such as repairing or movie special effects. so no matter what you use a computer for have it be job hunting, entertainment, or information, they are a good idea to have them in your home. there's a erason that @percent of @caps use them, and it's not just an excuse to sit around all stay.
7 dear local newspaper, @caps stand on this hole computers thing is that it is becoming a big issues because people are spending all there time in books instead of comuitateing with friends and family, exercising, or injoying nature. just like the expert then tinker siad in his book called @caps by computers  to much time on the computers and not the rackemed saven hours outsiad can make you very wnight.  @caps @caps why people should get out more is @caps they can have coumite shion with friends and family. i bet you did not know that @percent of kids from @num to @num are siting on thier cowth or play vite games as we. another @caps is that people need more exercis. more the @num of the leading of the country will be abeast due litle exercise, and that is mostly because of computers.and the last @caps, and the most importint as well, is @caps people can injoy nature at its fullist, blivie it or not but jack cup thinks @caps too he said '@percent of people how injoy nature will @num years longer and people now not will likely have a heart in there @num's  @caps that is why i think computers are bad for people but it is not just me it is @person, jackup @caps, sisintsits, and many percentages as well.
9 i walked into my living room one night and saw my mom on the computer. i thought to myself  she is always on that computer, doesn't she work to do? . i said to my mom  i think we should have an hour two of the computer each night, or not have one at all.  i told her that i think computers are a bad choice because you don't know who is on the internet and is trying to talk to you. also, it gets in the way of exercising and spending time with family and friends. the internet/computers are very dangerous now a days. you never know if someone is a friend or a predator trying to get you. say if you were talking to someone and you thought it was your friend, well you don't know for sure if it is then or not. i could be an older man or women trying to get a hold of you so they can probably kidnap you. steal from you and worse. now i watch the news and see many kidnapping because kids are talking to people on the internet and don't know who they are or what they look like. like, when a girl was talking to a man and she thought it was her friend, turns out it wasn't and she got in a whole lot trouble. maybe if she met him she would have gotten very hurt and be scared of that memory for the rest of her life. family is very important to most families now a days. i have heard that spending time with family would bring your grades up in school because as you talk to them, you learn new things. sadly this is not happening because people are so isolated to their computers they don't spend one minute with family or friends. i have a friend who is always on the computer. she never spends time with her family or friends. she is so focused on the computer screen then what is going on around her. recently she has been getting off the computer and making more time with family and friends. even her grades started going up because she spending more time studying with her mom and dad, then being on.... for example @caps or myspace and not getting any work done for school. in other words, she is very happy in life now and has changed from this experience she has gone through. most people think you can use your brain for knowledge and call it exercise. that is one way to put it but it is not exercise for your body. people have spent more time having their eyes glue to the computer screen that they don't go out and play or maybe go a gym. the rate of obecity in our country is increasing for many reasons and lack of exercise is one of them because people spend to much time watching tv and being on the computer. i have a little cousin who is over weight and should be out playing sports and exercising. but does she,  no ... she spends her free time on the computer in a stuffy room, instead of getting fresh air from outside. she keeps asking me how did i get and what age, and i keep telling her, i exercise and play sports so i can't tell you when. i keep saying that to her but she never listens. to this day she is still the same because she didn't take my advice to get off the computer and go outside to play. i strongly agree that we should have only two hours of the computer each night or have no computers at all. for kids saftey from bad people out there in the world, spending time with family and friends and finally for exercise and to stay fit with our bodies. i hope people understand what i say and take action to persue them in they own life and convice others too.
8 dear local newspaper, @caps you know any child or teen between the age of eight and seventeen who doesn't live to go on the computer? well myspace, facebook and aim is like a online hangout. kids every where log on and don't log out unless the parent of the child makes them. i firmly belive that computers have major effect on people, my three reasons are people don't have the exersise, they dont interact with others, kids are smocky they will sneak on if doing research for if wasnt . online websites and games are like hipnotysing the people and making them stay on for hours. most parents belive that having their child on a computer doing research for an hour is good; however kids are and would sneak to pay online going or go to a website they were not allowed to go on and wasnt on before. sometimes the best thing to @caps is get some fresh air and interact with others. buth with websites that make people stay conect for more than two hours they dont get fresh air and they dont interact with others . most times people forgot and dont know what something is except for how a computer because they play on it so much. people grow up fast when you think about it, and people start to eat, drink, sometimes sleep at the computer. people stay at the computer and eat their, they wont get enought exercise, they will start to get fat and soon an only stay at the computers because they didnt exercise burn the fat off. how you see how computers have a major effect on people by not interacting with others, not having enough, and kids wife sneaky and will go on other website, they wer not allowed to go on and if thier parents wernt home.
9 dear @caps @caps, i am a student at @organization middle school in @caps @caps @caps @caps recently you produced an article about computers where good or bad people i write today to say that computers are beneficial to people everywhere. this is true because computers help people with things hand eye coordination to learning advances to our schools finally it helps people communicate with ease, @caps plase consider the following. first of all computers help hand eye coordination greatly in the long run. this is true because people playing games on the computers got more skillful with using ther hands and eyes together. @organization ullodhers from @organization @location  computers help hand eye coordination @percent more than putting your son or daughter on the football team  @caps computer games could help kids get more acurate with there skills or that of any sport. @caps now you know why computers help people develop better hand eye coordination. secondly computers help people learn new things. although people might think to be false it is indeed true. @organization a recent study at @organization shows that @percent of schools in @caps use computers for research.finally recently had a paper about @person and the only scorce i thought of was wikipedia on the internet because it is faster than searching for a book about him. @caps now you understand the computer is a helpful learning tests. finally the computer is a great way to communicate online. it is better than @caps@number because it is faster and more than calling someone up and talking for. @caps it is alot cheper than @caps@number because you just have @num payment a-month unlike phone. where it starts to add up. inract @person or the @organization of @location in a recent study that  @caps@number are absolete now, with the internet peope can chat at lignning speed . finally using e-mail or facebook is @caps much better than phone tag on facebook you know where you can chat with. @caps thats my reasons that the computer is good for communicating. @caps now you see that computers are nessecery because they develop hand eye coordination, they @caps help people learn and finally they are a great way to communicate.
9 dear editor, i hear you are looking for your citizens opinion in if computers are bad or good. @caps opinion is computers are bad. i think computers are bad in three ways and i want to express them to your and hopefully persuade you into going towards @caps side. smell nice out to day. i can smell flowers, the grass, and many more, @caps first reason why computers are bad is if you use the computer to much you don't see enough of enjoying nature. nature is beautiful, it has @caps, green grass, rainbows (sometimes). you can make a walk of in the moons and just be yourself and be by yourself. in other words nature is very nice and you should set out and enjoy it. if you don't enjoy nature it might be no late, because soon it become and rainy and then, yes fem has flabberlasting colors, but what comes after fall, winter. winter is not nice, it is cold. you work, because you need to shovel the drive way and your car off and that can get very tire some. the goof of is you can get those chorse. oh not that make me to. @caps next reason why computers are bad. when was a good smile run. @caps next reason why i think computers are bad is spend all working and no time exersing. excersing is a very fun thing to do, you fel to go outside. hang with friends, any many shore. exercise is a main way of staying healthy. don't you can really get unhealthy, and sick and his dies, die i have a friend whom nothing use. the computer his body rest weaker and weaker so exercise ias am main piece of staing healthy. there are many ways to health you can bike, run, walk, rog canate, climb a mountain, etc. the posibilitys are endless while exercesing in the park you never knew you can meet. car's fast say your friend,  yo sup man,   not, you   not much, just fiding around for some exercise   same here, same here  see you never know who you can meet in the park now that was @caps friend. he is alwasys here, out how as you think, yep in the same park. i wouldn't have met him if i was insine on the computer. like i said be what was @caps friend. but since i come here every day i can meet a new friend every day maybe. so @caps last reason why i think the computer is bad is because you don't get enough interacting time with friends and family. i love @caps family but i interact with them. if they are exercising who if i am here on the computer. no one can. in conclusion i think the computer are bad because you can not get enought time exercising, enjoying nature, and spending @caps time with family and friends.
8 i belive having computers in a household is a good idea. they can play games, learn, talk and many more. here are my three reasons having a computer is a good thing. having a computer is great to play games! there are so many varieties to choose from. there are card games, board games, even @num games! you can play solo, but it might be more fun and easyier to bring some friends along for the ride. as you can see having a computer can be fun, but its not the only thing to do on a computer. useing a computer to learn is wonderful too. the computer can take you to places you have never seen, heard, or been to before, or maybe a place you couldn't afford to go. you @month learn that in on place it's sunny all the time and in other places it's not. another thing the computer can teach you is about animals. animals have been here way be for us. there is still much we dont know about them. many scientists have spent their lives studying animal and have put it on the iternet for you to better educate yourself. the computer can also teach you hand-eye. hand-eye is great to have if your trying out for a sport like football, baseball, and basketball. also you never know when you'll need to catch somthing. my final reason is also very helpful. being able to talk on the computer is good to using voice chat or instint messenger is your choice. while talking on the computer you might make some new friends that share the same intrests and hobbies you do. and you can chat with them as long as there online. also while your talking you can express your ideas and feelings. somtimes you might just need to blow off some steam. or maybe post an idea that can one day be famous. as you can see games, learning and talking are easier to do on the computer. this is why i think.
8 dear, @organization the big rectangular shaped black or white box with lights and beeps, the compter was a smart idea,! but why do you ask,? i'll show you. this device can teach you a new language, skype can let you talk to @caps on the web or on phone!, (but you still have to pay @money.) you can surf the web or have a laugh on youtube, who needs to go out and buy stuff when on ebay or amazon just order and your done, (but you still have to wait.) why go to blockbuster to rent movies when you can go on netflix and order a movie and keep it for as long as you like, no late fees, no driving all the way to the movie store, no more of that please!. next lets go back to the web, @caps you own a @caps or a built in camera on your laptop or netbook, you can video chat with @caps and family across the globe!, @caps you'r the kind of person that like video games then boy you will love this!, @caps   @caps's can download games such as sim's, spore, etc. then you will love the @caps. macs also share good stuff such as the finder, safari, dashboard, etc, so thats all i have to say about @caps. and now you are probably asking which computer should i get?, @caps @caps friend's at @organization @organization you have the abillty to choose either @caps or @caps, but it's not @caps disision to pick out your computer, it's yours so go out and create an investment for a computer today!. but im not finished yet you can also pick a laptop, a desktop, or a netbook i can tell about all of them and i will, a laptop is good @caps your on the go a lot and @caps your in the office or you have a lot of business trips its a good idea th have a laptop at hand,. a desktop is good @caps your home a lot and work is oniline on the web or just llike the comfort of home than a desktop is right for you!, and last but not least, the netbook, it's good @caps your on the go a lot especialy when yory on vacation, and it fits nicely on your lap or on a table or @caps you dont want to get up to use the computer just grab your netbook and your ready to go, i almost forgot all netbooks come with a built in @caps so @caps your on vacation and you dont have a phone or computer just go on your netbook and there you go. well thats all i have to say thanks for reading 
8 alot of people would disagree that computers are benefiting people. but i think that computers are exremely helpful because they are a good way to learn, they are fun to use, and it's also a goodway to talk to old friends. i know there are some people who are on computers alot more than they should but still computers are very helpful. computers are a very good way to learn because on a computer you could easily find out whi the @caps of @location is. but if you didn't use a computer and you went to a library it could take hours to find the right and find were in the book it is. you could also learn about news faster without writing for it to come on the news channel. computers are a lot beter than having to drive to a library because with just a couple as clicks you could find what you want and be done. computers are also fun because you can play little games on the internet that could easily take up on extra @num minutes that yu might have on a work break or before school. and even some games exercise your mind like solitare its fun but hard. but there are some games that people tend to over do because they go addicted. but most people haven't ever prayed a game like that or only play once in a while. lastly computers are a good way to stay in touch with old friends because there are a lot of ways to talk to people online like say if when you were in high school your best friends moved away you sould still talk to people on a chat room were you can text. or a video chat were you actualy see them face to face. in conclusion i think computers are helpful because you can learn, play and talk to people. computers are best all around helpful.
12 the innovation of computers was a great leap into discovery. unfortunately, the negative aspects of this magnificent invention detract from the novelty. with the computer came a plague of not exercising and a disinterest in, perhaps even an inabilty to enjoy nature. on top of this destruction of the mind, this monster is the cruel cause of many declining relationships for who has time for friends and family while in the middle of an internet game? as unique and intriguing as the computer might be, it is slowly destroying the mind. increasing interest in a monitor tends to result in decreasing care for exercise as well as a decline in the amount of exercise gotten each day. while playing on the computer, the mind @month be racing but the body sits unmoving, @caps activity is being done. indeed, for some the addiction is awful enough that the person only moves to get food, use a restroom, go to bed or when a parent demands it. all of the day's food settles into the stomach and little to none of it is burned off. meanwhile, in some of the more severe cases the person is so entranced that bedtimes are pushed later. sleep is essential to the body and mind and going without can be damaging. nowadays the computer detracts from the sleep and exercise that the body requires. even nature suffered from the advent of computers. fewer people went out to admire its beauty. nature is a wonderful teacher about the circle of life and the natural way of the world. oftentimes parallels can be drawn between the wild and the tamed. attached as people are to computers, they cannot experience the world to the fullest. some argue that flora and fauna can be found online, but seeing a picture is different, almost cheating, compared to being beside the plant, able to study it from all angles rather than in an unmoving form. the experience is not the same. also, computers are indoors, so the true world is chielded from view. even nowadays with laptops if one was to be brought outside, the user would be focusing on the screen, not what is around them. computers have severely cut down on the admiration of nature. even family and friends suffer when computers are around. many people barely pay attention to conversation while focusing on the screen. they tend to onlypretend to listen half the time. even when chatting with friends online, the conversation is disjointed because attention is probably focused on another part of the internet. frequently, during conversations without a computer nearby, the mind is focused on something from earlier that day. relationships are suffering, and computers are at fault. computers are sucking in society, more of it each day. much of what is done on computers, like the study of faraway places, can easily be found in books. computers have resulted in a lack of exercise, less time with nature, strained relationships, and a generally unhealthy lifestyle. through all of this, they have returned little to society. why does the world continue to put up with computers and their negative effect on humanity?
12 almost every family has access to a computer. they have become a part of life and a way to be a part of life outside of your house, even if you have to stay at home. computers are a source of vast knowledge from millions of sources. they have already caused exponential advancement. overall, computers have a positive effect. on a rainy day, @num students will spend time on their computers. out of those students, @percent will be on sites such as a.i.m.(@caps @caps @caps), @caps, @caps, or @organization. even if they can't use their phone or get out of the house, they can communicate with friends, old and new. teens and adults use the @caps to talk in friends they haven't seen for up to @num years. people will talk to eachother more, building more relationships and better conversational skills. over @num of the sites used by teens are based on @caps networking. to be able to easily have a conversation with someone miles away is a sign of tremendous advancement. @organization is a multi-million dollar company. @person, a for @organization, says that sites like @organization have skyrocketed in popularity over the @date. more and more people are putting down their @person dictionary to type the word into @location, where it is accompanied by a pronunciation and found more easily. students use computers for information on school reports in @caps, @caps @caps, @caps@number or @caps. information can be found in any subject. there was a survey taken to see which is used more often, books with a specific subject or computers for information or various subjects. computers are used overwhelmingly more often. they're quicker than books and it's easier to search for a of resource an the @caps. and say sight of particular interest or exceptionally usefull can be added to your favorites. computers are more practical than books. pictures of scientific laboratories where space shuttles are sent to the moon have @num main component computers. adds from @organization show that they're computers are getting smaller and smaller. there's a laptop that will fit in an envelope and a handheld touch screen computer that can almost fit in your pocket. you can type papers and assignments so they're more ledgible. computers can even score tests. advancement is centered around computers. before computers, so many things we do now would seem impossible. but computers open up a realm of possibilities. typing is faster then hand-writing in some cases and papers can be saved electronically. if our country keeps advancing at the rate, than it is possible to have computers that do maindain chores such as taking out the trash or washing the dishes. there can be computers that talk bark to you like a real conversation. people can learn more and more information and personally advance in intelligence. i look at a computer and think of progress. there are points of computers that are not ideal, but overall, computers are benefitial to society. in a computer, you have access to friends old and new and information from millions of sources. most of all, computers represent progress and advancement i see no direct harm from computers.
11 dear @organization, the use of computer benefits society due to the possitive affect on people. such as good hand-eye coordination, ability to learn about far away places and people as well as being able to talk online with family and friends. did you know that teenagers who use computers often when compared to those who don't, have increased test scores? this is because they are able to look so definitions faster, research and learn about anything they need at their fingertips. furthermore, families and friends that live across the country are able to keep in touch due to email, video chats and facebook. it is fascinating to realize that use of the computer can increase your hand eye coordination. you are probably wandering how this is and think that i am insane but there are legitimate reasons. since i play basketball, volleyball and softball, hand eye coordination is extremely important. one cold, wintery @date @time. i was working on a long history paper and @caps essay, which meant countless hours on the computer typing. at five o'clock off i went to my basketball grow, @caps the best game of my life was playerl. then, a week later, we had another game but this time i went straight from church. consequently, i did not play as well; missed a lot of passes and shots. this proved to me that things use of computers, my hand-eye coordination improved. can you imagine being able to learn about people in faraway places, their cultures, ethicities and relgion? well now this is more than possible through the advances in technology. in history, we were doing research on the world hunger crisis in our allied countries. through the knowledge of this hunger, i was able to start a fundraiser at my church. @person; @caps teenagers like myself do not eat for @num hours. research has proven that @num children in countries of africa die a day from malnurutousment. now that this has been brought to my attention, i am going to work four hours a day to give these innocent children even a portion of what i consume. thus through the use of computers i was able to learn about the pain those children suffer and now it's my . do you have family that's across the country that you are rarely able to see? my aunt and uncle live in @location and they were just blessed with a beautiful baby boy, @location. since we are only graced with their presenced about once a year we begin to miss them. but now through skype, email and facebook, we are able to stay updated on the success and growth of @location as well as @caps they have recently traveled to. also @percent as the teenage population in the @caps.s spend at least four hours a day @caps, tweeting or using facebook to stay in touch with their friends. recently, i have moved from @location to @location and staying in contact with my fr iends there is extremely important to me. those are the people that i grew up with and have known since birth. the use of computers has allowed me to stay in contact with distant friends and relatives. to conclude, due to improved hand-eye coordination, ability to learn about far away places and people as well as being able to communicate online, with other people the use of computers benefits society. through the internet, people can learn about @location places to travel bike and exercise while enjoying nature. furthermore, when family and friends want to spend time together, they need to plan the logistics of it and without email and being online this becomes nearly impossible. i appreciate you taking the time to read this and hopefully you will take my opinion into consideration when debating over the topic of computer.
8 @organization, computers have great benefits to our society. whether it is because it helps people get their work done. or it allows people to communicate without telephone numbers. maybe it's because it helps students study. with any of these reasons, computers are really benefiting our society. have you ever had a paper assigned one day and due the next? if you think back what had helped you complete the paper? most likley it was a computer. in a recent survey @percent of college students say that they would not be getting the good grades that the were getting if they didn't have a computer. but, computers don't just help students, they can also help adults in the working community. i know that i have made friends over the years that have moved away and that i have lost touch with. with a computer it is easier to find those people and start talking to them. with different types of programs, you could most likley find anyone. whether it's @caps, @caps, @caps, or @caps. nine out of ten adults said that they found a lof of their highschool friends thanks to the computers. furthermore, computers are a way for students to study. students could find search engines and reasearch a paper. or they could play educational games. with a computer if a student forgot his or her homework they could most likley use a computer to find out what the work was. when i went to the middle school to survey, @num out of @num students said that they would check to see if it was on the computer before asking a friend. so as you can see computers have benifits to our society today. three just happen to be that they help people get work done faster, they help keep you in touch with friends and they help students to study.
8 i think that computers have positive effects on peole. people can find out important news online, and you can connect with people you don't see often. also, you can order anything in the world online. these are three reasons why i believe computers have a positive effect on people. computers inform people about important news. if there is a blizzard people can find out ahead of time and stock up on food. if there is a burglar going around, people can find out, and lock all doors and windows. and by knowing all this information, it helps helps people plan events, like birthday parites. finding out important news is very helpful, and conveniant. and @percent of people, are less to inconveniances, if they know the news. another way computers have a positive effect on people is by allowing them to connect with people they don't see often. this provides an easy way to share events tha have taken place, and just have some time to talk face to face. with video chat, you can show off new , or newborn baby. you can share you want with people you barely see. experts say that freindships last longer if you talk to each ohter often. and with computers, this is possible. a third way computers help out is allowing you to order anything in the world online. if you need a japanese doing for someone in ohio, you can order it online. if you're are old, and can't go to the grocery store anymore, you can order then online. i have seen that people who can order everything online, don't have to do a lot of driving, and this saves time, money, and gas. this is also very convendent and is less stressful then waithing in lines to purchase on item. these are just three ways htat computers have had a positive effect on people. the are that you can find out important news, you connect with people you don't see ofte, and you can order anything in the world that's why i believe comptuers have a positive effect on people.
10 do computers really benifit society? this has been a tricky question for years. some people say computers are a huge help and it allows us to see the world through a different perspective; we learn more from computers and this vast increase in tecknology. though others say computers are addicting, it is the @caps unsafe and unsecure machine to be using especially when it is left a lot of personal files on it while hooked up to the internet. plus people spend more time on a computer than ever, missing out on thier families and friends, not being able to enjoy nature and the other simple things in life. besides, if you want my honest opinion, computers should only be used as tools.  the fact is many people look to computers as personal diaries or something to save files on or even something to play games on,  says @person.  they ignore the biggest fact that computers are only used to make life easier.  this is really what computers are made to do, help us. it could be as simple as a @caps (@organization) or as complexed as a super computer but it still only serves the main purpose of making life easier. even if you tried to upgrade a computer it would still serve the same purpose, yet people still look on it as if it were still the next big thing in entertainment. many people might not even know it yet but computer can turn on you and really ruin your life. ever since @person made @organization the @caps popular disk @organization @organization around, people have been using computers alot. its not because he created the fastest computer ever. it is because @organization is selling world wide; for buisnesses, small companies, schools, even in entertainment. a few years ago they made something called the xbox @num. it revolutionized both gaming and the way people look at gaming. but whats the problem here? the problem is that because of @organization people are now more addicted to entertainment. when this happens people will start becoming dependent on a computer. its not that @organization did anything bad but the fact that since @caps computers have internet, those people who depend on computers are going to find it hard to avoid being hacked or worse getting all their information stolen. there is this one thing about computers that remains constant. family and friends will find it hard to talk to there loved one when they spend all there time on computers. this makes comunication hard, and like i said before its very addicting.  @caps of the people who don't have real friends will chat with people online not knowing who they really are.  says @caps @person. making friends online is the @caps unsafe thing to do on a computer. over @percent of the people online are not who they say they are and people will often break away from thier real friends just to find this new  friend  they've made. so remember, even though computers are
11 dear @location, i understand this focus situation, the effect of computers or our society people's reactions are less than about them & my question to is who? computers a very good effect on our town's specify. computers areaids in tracking hand-eye coordination. they give people the opportunity to look at things & talk to that it traveled here they wallets empty faster than the speed of it. @caps also have the ability to help people so things that an than a pig sty. let me explain more these reasons. computers are very good for our society because they are kids in tracking hand-eye coordination to kids & adults. just to help you understand why in to teach hand-eye coordination, @caps are so many that help you learn but help you learn will get you. in foot ball catching helps to teach the skill but makes you up on the ground after being by someone potentially yourself. in baseball swinging at a pitch to teach his skill, but if the is very close to you it could how you for the if you do the ball could someone & hurt them, ability to day back. computers are great way to this skill in a saw even @caps @person here in town says that he has seen an of kids with better hand eye coordination, due to do have a good our town? well, computers let people to that. you can talk to relatives in far away places but to travel with this. i'm sure that you're wondering if i have i do have another reason. computers have to samethings electronically so fast easily, make a look on computer's hard drives, @caps are so much more that ran be on a computer, that make a room empty. before my famiy had a computer complete dedicated to papers files that your so important & that we could not lose. when up got picture, typed up paper, saved our was empty! i hope that this letter has proves to you computers effect on our society. computers help and in the process of hand eye coordination. the help to thing happen but if done on real life could faster of they also help to electronically than a. so now, after this letter you go out i publish this telling every good effects of computers. again i thank you for reading this letter.
8 to whom it @month concern, @caps more people are getting involved with using the computer while i think that is great other don't. i believe that using a computer is a good thing because technology is going to progress and computers will be the base, also computers are safer now because or privacy options and virus block. finally, computers help you gather knowledge that no one book could tell you. although technology is progressing computers are only the basics. sooner or later everything will be based on computers like, jobs, school, and ever the medical field. jobs will have more computers and touch screen devises because they are easier and more technologicly advanced. as for school @caps students have to take computer classes to learn how to write brouchures and make websites. the medical field is now using more advanced ultrasounds that take the image and make it there dementional. so, if everything is changing around you why do you want to be stick in the past? although, some people are worried about internet saftey and viruses, there are ways that those can be limited. as for social networking sites don't set it up for the whole world to see. set it up for only your friends to see. also, make sure you know who your friends are. as for viruses, don't go on websites that cause viruses. also, you can get a virus blocker that helps eliminate them. the computer also helps to give you and get you knowledge. you can learn about cocrent civilizations. or modern day without taking a step out of your house. also the internet has vertual simulations so you can experence what it was like in other coultures, in other time pericals. computers give you knowledge that help you through your life especially if you don't have a library. even though some people disagree computers are the base of technology, safe, and full of knowledge i do. yes, they do have some flaws but they are a great learning tool.
12 dear @caps, @caps and kids of any age at this society, are way to focused on the latest technology. one piece of equptment that is affecting peoples lives, is the computer. we need to get rid of this habbit and learn to do different activites! people are spending way to much time on computers and less time enjoying nature excersing, and need to interact with friends and family more take the time to agree with me as i confront you on how the computer is taking over our lives! is time flying you by? are you overwhelmed, at how life passes you so quickley? well, if you answered yes, stop the computer madness and head on outside! your no enjoying nature! nature is as beautiful as a gorgeous scene of @caps @caps love oceans with pink sand. who would want to miss this? @percent of @caps complain that they rarely enjoy what life has to take on the outside of your house. just think you won't be able to see the stupendous, the seasons changing, withought going outdoors.  i want my @caps, to experience the wide variety of nature as she grows old.  @caps of her daughter. well, @month i add, little @caps is not going to get much nature out of her, if she does not get her eyes unglued to the comuter screen! yes, comuters, are very brilliant, and have lots to do, but if you want to be missing out on the new trees being discovered every day, be my guest! @percent of all the population in the @location is overweight due to technology brought into our world. the greatest impart is the computer! high-paid physicians try and teach their parents at a young age, to go out and play sports - while excersing at the same time and nor to stay home and play videogames. now you tell me, would you rather get a good healthy excersise, and have all the energy you need or would you like to slowy add on to your and gain issues as you the internet? i remember @date, i grabred my nike hightops, and my pink ipod i started jogging at a slow while listening to my favorite song. naturally by i felt amazing when my was complete going each day is as healthy as eating a bannana, @num apples, and cheese eery morning their healthy!  @caps since technology has been a part of my life, my two daughters have not visited their grand parents in over @num years! this needs to step!  @caps @person to the press. yes, comuters have  online-talking  devices such as @caps, but if you are never going to spend quality time with family, this is a bad habbit. on @date, @date, my brother and i, were too busy on the computer, we missed a birthday party the family we are addicted to this device, and need to spend time with our loved ones. @percent of all therapy computers have @caps into depresion and have been with their plains, due to the high amount of to do on this device and less time bonding with members of your who would rather play on a old, gray, computer when you can have fun talking about you day and the game life with your family? @caps@number now a never! what will you choose? do you agree that computers take over lives? if you try and prove me wrong just remember, nature is a big and many people are missing out on the advantage technology is taking over peoples excersing habbits, and many families are less bonding @caps@number up to you keep the population of @location in good hands!
9 dear local newspaper @caps, are computers really as great as they seem? it seems to me that they are used way too much in people's lives, and that computers are distractions that don't allow people to di ceratin things in their life that they would if they weren't always on the computer. people's lives are starting to revolve around going on the computer, checking your facebook, and looking at new videos on @caps.com. i know from experience facebook or myspace can be very addicting. i'll spend hours commenting on pictures or new wall posts, and then at @num pm i've realized i haven't begun any of my loads of homework. this happens quite often, and i end up staying awake until around @num. the following moring i wake up at @num am, exhausted. i am not exaggerating either, this happens to many of my friends, and if you have kids, ask them because i am @percent sure they are on facebook or @caps all night. this doesn't just happen with kids either, my mom just got a facebook and she is hooked to it, even more than i am. sometimes it can be come a competition to see who has the most pictures, or the most friends. kids start adding people as friends that they don't even know computers aren't just distractions, they are also very dangerous. at my school we had assembly where they showed us how easy it was to find out someone's personal information, even if you don't have your address or your phone number listed, there are many other ways to track you down. if you take a picture right after you won the championship soccer game, in your jersey. just that one picture shows your team name, your last name, and your number. anyone could easily search all that stuff on the internet and know exactly where your next game be. as the local newspaper @caps, i am sure you must be concerned about the safety of the town, or even your own kids. some people @month say  that would never happen to me  but it easily could, especially if you're constantly on your computer. i have noticed that a lot of teens around my age are starting to become obsessed with being on the computer. a lot of times in families, instead of spending time together. syblings are fighting over who gets to go on the computer. one sybling @month need it for homework, while the other just wants to talk to her friends on @caps and each believes they deserves the computer. computers are starting to interest a lot with people's lives, in a negative way. once again they are distracting, dangerous and hurt families. computers hurt society more than it helps. and maybe you should look into how much time your kids are spending on the computer. 
6 i think having a computer is good because you can research stuff and you can meet people and chat with them. computers are important to society because it helps keep track of info like doctor appointments and crimnal records for police to follow by. having a computer is a good but if you spend to much time on it you will hurt you eyes. having a computer can help you talk to friends who have moved and have website that they can talk to you on like myspce or facebook or even yahoo chat. when having a computer its very helpful in life and can help you in a lot of areas. computers can also cause problems like spending to much time on it and not getting enough sleep for school. having a computer can also be bad because sitting to close or spending to much time can hurt your eyes and cause you to wear glasses. the way i look at it as i see is that to much is bad so i think spending some time on it is good do you agree?
9 dear local newspaper committee...., i am writing to you, about how there is a substancial dilemma within the concern of computer use. from my data that i have collected, computers are both somewhat good, and bad. but i believe that there are more reasonable  @caps,  toward computer use. in my opinion, i state that computers are quite addicting due to, addiction of computer, loss time of exercise, and how computers @month  help,  one in obtaining the loss of their social enviorment. computer @month seem helpful but of @organization they are a great way to research for @organization reasons. but there is also the choice of books for research. computer use has risen to a substancial crisis line, because they are addicting. an example is the well-known link called,  @caps,  @caps is a place where you can socialize. but when your child has a @caps, and they are on the computer doing  homework,  there is a @percent that they will end upon @caps, than rather doing their homework that important information was found at an @organization @date. computers are addicting also because of online computer games. computer games online can be fun, but are a complete waste of time for you electrical bill, and @organization purposed of you child. computers are very addicting in terms of @caps, and online games. computers are somewhat good, but are very to you health. did you know that @percent of @location has increased their weight, due to videogames and computer? computers are horrible when it comes to this topic. overtime, you begin to gain weight by spending more time using the computer and less time working out and staying fit. this also revolves around addiction, by using the computer over a large period of time. in the end, computers are a harzardous topic, when it comes to working out, and staying in shape. computers are terrible and horrified when it comes to friends. friends are people who spend time with you and interact with you. but computers see it a different way. by using computer for a long period of time, you begin to think how computers are all you need. soon enough, your friends will leave you because you don't care about them, and forget them. this also revolves around addiction. by addiction, you lose your friends and you damage your social enviornment. computer @month seem  fun,  but are defuliated when it comes to friends. in the end, i beleive that computers are a waste, because they are addicting you become very unhealthy and they strive to damage your social enviornment. with the facts i have stated, they have supported my reasons. computers are not the way to go. so, try books.
8 dear newspaper, in my opinon i think computers do have a positive affect on people. they can learn about far away places. they let people talk online. it can even help you find a job. this is why i think computers are very positive. certainly, people can learn about far away places on the computer. say, someone wanted to take a trip to @location they can look it up, learn the launage. they can by tickets. they could also find interesting things to see in that country. these reasons are why i think a computer is a positive technology. my next reason i think a computer is positive toward people is that people can comuicate online. this can help keep families in touch. it can help you find and talk to old friends (facebook). you can even make new friends to talk to. these are other examples why i think computers are positive. my last reason i think computer have a positive affect on people is that it can help you with jobs. it can help you find a job. it can also help you with your job. lastly, it can have you have a higher position at your job. these are my reasons i think computers are important and positive to people. for all the reasons above are reasons i think computers are an awesome =) and positive technology, i mean just look at all the reasons. they let people talk online. they can also teach you about far away places. and even help you with your job. this is why i think computers have a positive affect on people.
8 dear @caps, @caps you know that computers can prevent you from doing a lot of things? instead of going on the computer you can exercise more, play outside, and spend more time with family and friends. this is why you need to spend less time on the computer. exercise is important to your body and computers are not. you can get some weights and exercise in your room. a run out the beach doesn't sound bad either. just by doing that you lose a lot of weight and not gaining weight on the computer. so go exercise and lose weight because it's good for you! computers also prevent you from getting freash air and playing outside. when your are outside you see that playing is much better than just pressing buttons and clicking everywhere. on the computer. you don't even have to play outside, you can just walk with someone or just sit on the grass and talk. the computer prevents you from doing all of this fun activities outside. spending time with your family is a huge activity that your computer is prevting you to do. you are on the computer for an hour and your family is having a barbeque. you finally get off that computer and you realize that spending time with them is so much fun than sitting down and looking at the screen. this is why computer are a distraction to everyone because you don't want to exercise, play outside, or spend time with the family. you can use the computer but just don't stay on to long because you are missing the fun.
11 dear @caps have you ever wondered how much the world wide web has to offer? i would definetly agree that computers have a benificial effect on people. they teach hand eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about far away places and they give people the chance to recconnect or new people. the internet has so much to offer and is absolutley benifical. studies done by @person, doctor at @organization stated that @percent of people who are on the computer typing have better hand eye coordination than those who do not. you could be improving your coordination and not even know it! intelligent people would agree that being on the computer is very helpful to you. there are many computer games are there that you have to react quickly to and call for fast reflex and hand eye coordination. i know personally that it has help us. since @caps been on the computer more i have noticed that my reaction time off this block for has shockly improved! yes, i know that some people should get outside and exercise, but you can excersize and improve your hand eye coordination, either way you can go wrong. as the massive sits in space like high take fascinating worlds it the computers. the technology of computers to learn about the far away places. kevin, scientist that @percent of our knowing about space come from computers! for example think about google earth; it allows the human eye to see clear pictures of anywhere in the world! i think you would agree that without computers we would a lot of knowledge about the wonderful world around us. would you rather us not have computers and not know half the stuff about we live in? by these high tech computers we can learn about life outside like space, and other galaxies. did you know that @num of the population use the computer to talk, and reconnect to friends and family. i know i do! i know that people shouldn't be to computer, talking to people. but its a great way to stay in touch with people. they have awesome websites like skype and oovo that allows you to chat with other people over. friendly, educated people agree that this is a good way to catch up with old friends from highschool or even way back to grade school. another great aspect of online communicating is long friendships can be created. newly explain, now they not online and got so close they ! personally i know that i go to @date camp every year and make new friends. internet websites like facebook helped me keep in touch with her. clearly this is a great source to use! the time has come to decide the choice of using computers would deffinetly be a wise one. without a doubt it will certainly help you; hand eye coordination and keep you talk or recconect with people. most importantly it gives people the ability to learn about the wonders of far away places. so dont make the wrong choice, and appreciate and use all this computers have to offer.
8 dear newspapper i don't think that computers benefit our society. i don t believe that computers can be dangerous they make people lazy and you can be easily scammed on the computer. one reason why i don t think that computers benefit society is because it is very dangerous. computers are dangerous because people can get kidnapped or herrassed. the town of @location police @caps says that over @percent of kidnappings are from people that were met on social networks such as myspace and facebook. the police cheif also says that their are many cusses about people being herrassed by stalkers or people trying to harm them. another reason why i dont think computers benifit us is because you can be scammed very easily on the computer. @percent of people say that they have lost large ammounts of money due to credit card scam's on the computer. on computers their are sites that will act as if they are selling you something and take your credit card number and all of the other information that you give them and they will take your card and buy thing with it and you will have to pay for it credit card companies say that most credit card scams and frauds happen over the computer. the final reason why i don't believe that computers benifit us is because they make people lazy. computers make people lazy because they are packed with a bunch of fun things like video games and you can watch videos and you could shop and you could see just about anything on a computer. i did some research and found that @percent of people that are over weight have account's on multiple sites on computers. these are the reasons why i dont think computers benifit us. i hope you too heed to my advice.
8 in my opinion, i do believe that computers are good for you. i agree so because one, it can help you to communicate with other family members around the world. two, it can teach you new languages you really desired to learn, and three, it can keep you updated on whats happening around the world. first, i believe that computers are good for you because it can let you communicate with your long-lost relatives you hardly see anymore. for example, if you miss any of your family members, you can simply go to your computer and search them up so you can type to them or talk to them through via chat mode, then you won't ever have that missing feeling anymore since you have a computer. in addition, computers can teach you how to learn new languages you alway's wanted to know, like, @caps, or @caps, or even @caps if you wanted! you can just simply go to your computer and type in  language of @caps , and listen what it tells you of @caps! moreover, computers can keep you updated on whats happening around the world! it is way better to see it on computers than on tv's bevause computers give you more information about the situation of the event! likewise, you could click,  locate area , on the computer and see in which area the incident took place in. you could also see the video's, behold the images, and seek the location of it on the computer. sadly, my lecture has come to an . those were my three main reasons why computers are good for people: you can communicate with long-lost relatives of yours, you can learn new languages, and therefore be updated on the qhats happening around the world. would'nt you wan't to uphold those amazing events also?
9 dear local newspaper, have you even been on a computer too long & haven't spent time excersising, or haven't spent any time with your family? well, that's a big problem here in the @location. in my opinion, to make this problem better, people should only be allowed on the computer for a certain amount @organization time & after they enjoy themselves with a nice workout, time outside & most importantly with their families. i think this will make the problem better, because you can enjoy yourself a little bit more rather than getting home from school & shooting right to wherever your computer is & being on it for the rest @organization the night. i also think this will help the problem because it will also allow you to get better grades. if your on computer all the time & don't have any time to excersise, go outside, and bond with your family then that most likely means you have no time to do homework. by not doing homework, your grades could go lower & you most likely won't understand what you are learning in that class. this one problem ran also affect you so many other ways. the problem with computers & why people, mostly kids are so attached with them is because @organization websites such as twitter, facebook, youtube, etc. & kids are @caps to them. this is part @organization the problem because kids can't get off @organization them, they like it so much. this problem leads to the main problem because if parents say  time to get off... go get some fresh air.  the kid always goes  one minute  & the parents let them get away with that, but then that  one minute  turns into an hour at most. this is bad because by the time the kid gets off the computer, its dark out and they can't go run around outside. i think this is important because think that facebook & twitter should be limited amount @organization time and should log you off after @num minutes. in conclusion, this problem is a national issue & in my opinion should be a new law, that kids have to play outside, and spend time with their families before going onto any computer. as you can see having all these great websites leads into a problem with kids. thanks for your time on reading why i think computers are a big problem here in the @organization.
9 dear the @caps @caps, experts say that computers are  taking over people , i strongly disagree. people spend the amount of time they need and want then become active or spend time with family and friends. computers allow people to learn, they allow people communicate to family and friends, too. also, @caps people use computers for work and jobs. i believe computers allow people, like myself, to learn. you can learn also @caps things on the computer. you can learn about other countries, you can read articles on news, also. you can learn different languges and about the world. online people can communicate with others. there is skype, which allows you to communicate with others while on the internet, you use a webcam. there is also instant messanger, or @caps. @caps is like having a conversation with a person who's right next to you! then there is email which can send letters, photos and comments. @caps people use computers for work. microsoft @caps allows you to type stories and type letters. @caps people do job reports on @caps. also, the internet is helpful for work. websites and search engines help you a lot. websites can contain information that working people need. to finish this letter, i want to say that @num) computers allow people to learn. @num) they allow people to communicate with friends and family. lastly, @num) @caps working people use the computer for work and reports. i hope i influenced you to see why computers aren't bad.
8 has your daughter or son ever asked you that they want computer in their school? were you ever baffled when they said they were talkking about @caps in the school, that they can teach hand eye coordination, gives them the ability to learn from far away places, or even allow them to talk to people all around the world? what did you think about that? did you agree? if you did then your thinking about the positive side and not the negative. many reasons why i don t agree. saftey, the money, health. many people said that its good to interact with other people but not all the time if your son or daughter interacts with people they @caps know are you going to be worried.? they can be asked who they are, were they live. sometimes they even ask if they can meet up face to face. my friend @person said her school got those computers and her friend @person was asked to meet or with somebody she never knew and she ended up saying yes and @person says she nevered showed up. would you ever want that to happen to your child? well this is only the begining. once your child s school gets computers they will be addicted to @caps, @person said that  if a child does not go out and enjoy there childhood but they want concentrate on their homework, they will just eat and be on the computer eventually they will become obese.  @caps is very imperative that your child does go out and have fun and get exercise because then they will just be on the computers @num. have you ever wondered that? another thing is the school will have to pay alot of money, if your child ever damages the computers then you will also have to pay a lot of money too. not only if your childs school gets computers @caps will benefit you guys alot. i trolly and sincerly do not belive that students should get computers. also your students computers @month get viruses because of inappropriate sites. then your going to pay for that as well. lastly the school will not have enough money for materials. what will you do?!? your child is not there to be addicted to computers your child is there for education! do you still support these computers!? i hope not because there is a @percent chance that they will or will not get @caps. hopefully i gave you enough information about the saftey, money and health. this is very urgent situation so please be aware.
9 dear @caps, i beleave that computers have a good and a bad effect on people. even though i think it has both effects on peope, i think that it has a better effect i think this because the internet gives people the chance to learn more about other places. allows people to talk to family that lives far away, and it also helps to make new friends. i support the advances of technology. i support it because people can talk to their family that they can't get to see. i have three cousins that live in @location that i never get to see, but with computers i can talk to them all the time. we can email and @caps to chat to eachother to find out what they've been doing, hows school, and so much more. my aunty loves to send and get pictures from them to see how much they've changed since the last time we saw them. without the new technology we wouldn't be able to do that. computers also help learn about other countries and the people that live there. with the internet you can find what the country looks like, what types of food they eat, what type of language they speek, and so much more. recently i had to do a project in @caps @caps about a place in @location. i got @location, @location with the help of computers i found out so much more about the country that i never even know about. there were so many great places to visit and learn about the history of @location. learning so much about the place makes me want to visit there someday. without computers i never would have learned so much about that place. another great thing about the new technology is that we can make new friends and talk to different types of people from all over the world. i read recently in the @caps @caps that atleast @percent of kids have a myspace or facebook that helps them interact with people from all over the world. there can also be dangers to talking to people you've never met before. to be safe don't tell people your phone number or where you live. but meeting new people can also be good. for example, my cousin doesn't get along very well with the people she goes to school with. but after school she goes on her computer and talks to people that are just like her. either way she should be careful. in conclusion, i must say once again that i support the advances of technology to an extent. computers help you talk to family that you don't see, helps you learn about new countries, and meet new people. thank you for your time.
8 i support advances in technology because in the future. our world will be run by computers people can learn about places and people that they can never afford to see for real, and lastly, this helps to connect people to other people without talking to them directly. have you ever thoughtabout the future, i know i have, usually when you think future, you think nobody and lots of automated things. the fact is the world is turning into a pure run by technology and as we the people get smarter, so does the technology so what good will the future if none of us know how to work a simple peice of technology such as a computer, then how are we going to use the more complicated things then? believe it or not our world within @num years will be run all on computers, you will not have to do antyihg but wil them. without computers, how would we know aobut all of the stuff that we know now. how would people know that egypt looked like @num year ago? they dont to be there they could just look it up on the computer and how just as must about it as if they went there. also computers enable you to learn about people that lived before your time. what president that you in something aobut how would you be able to find out after computer you could go to a library is right there to be will out computers in todya society. our average being would in at how does becaus of the that computers have given us. i can whey some experts are conceried that are however, for some people this is the only correction to their emily and friends it there is a family that lives lets say in a different country, and he or she wanted to talk to you, how would you go about doing that? i know that i would try to contact them on the computer. i love friends that live out of state and i enjoy talking to them so if we did not have the compuers that we do. these experts are sasying that we are going to drive across the country to talk to them, if you ask me htat is pretty tire consuming and pointless. in conclusion, i hope that you agree with me in keeping technology in our lives is important because of the future for people to learn nee things about places and people, and also to communicate with friends and family although i can se your part of view that kids are not getting enough exercise most kids that computers are also involved sport.
8 dear editor of @organization, i am writting this letter to you @caps i think people are not getting enogh exercise @caps they spend so much time on the computer and they are going to websites here are some things that i want you to write about so people can and @month be aware. my first reason i exercise why this @caps so many people spent so much time on the computer they don't get they don't walk. they sit and want message their frends @caps day. not worrying that they are ganning @caps and @caps a on their heart @caps of the @caps. @caps of this it can @caps to heath @caps things could you can't do @caps. m @caps reason @caps @caps websites to moral kids @caps@number @caps things they are not suppose see when kids have free @caps computer excise the thing wen let me @caps this can @caps@number @caps @caps sites, gunsites, @caps to a things can make something they @month really hurt someone or maybe even themselves. kids try to learn @caps people talk like @caps websites things that they are not able to and over they can see are @num on @caps @caps. my third reason chat sites places to get some attension they will @organization things they are not suppose to the @num year oldd man here some things to write are doing and please monitor them as much as you can to prevent this.
8 dear @organization, i took a poll of @num people and @percent of them agree computers have a positive effect on people. computers can help people talk to someone in a far away place, teach people hand-eye coordination, and give the ability to learn about people or places. using computers is a great way to keep in touch with someone. for example, my grandparents live in @location. some of the ways i keep in touch with them are e-mailing, video chating, and instant messaging. some other good things about talking to people online is if you're talking to many people at once or if your parents are on the phone. another good thing about computers is they are good at teaching people hand-eye coordination. the ways of teaching this are typing, and clicking on something, @caps people, when they type, look at the keyboard. but, with pratice, they will advance to looking at the computer screen while typing. to click on something, you need to move the mouse while still looking at the screen. that, believe it or not, is hand-eye coordination. one last reason computers are good at helping people is it a student needs to look up a place or person for a school report, they can very easily go to google.com and type in who or what they are looking for. another option is , say someone is going on a vacition to @location and they know nothing about it. they can go on the internet and get information on @location with just a couple clicks of the mouse. finally, say someone wants to learn about @organization @organization for fun: they type @organization in look at all the websites, choose the best one, and start reading. in conclusion, i deffinately think computers have a positive effect on people for the reasons i have stated. people can talk to someone online, computers can teach hand-eye coordination, and finially, people can look a person or place up using the internet. this is my opinion on computers, i hope you agree.
9 dear newspaper, @caps, my name is @person and i believe that computers have a negative influence on people. when people are on computers all day they have less time exercising. they are in alot more danger, and they spend less time with there family. these are my only some reasons why computers dontbenefit society.. in more, more time spent on computers equals less time exercising. with the obesity rate rising no one wants to be unable to do regular activitys. with spending all your time on the computer, you would just be using to get over weight and unhealthy. it also makes many people feel self consiou about themselves. if they dont have enough time exercising and keep eating they will become even more self consious. more over it will bring more danger to you and your family. there are many places on the internet where you can meet new people. but how do you know if people are who they seem to be? if you spend more time on the computer then you will increase your chances by @percent to get a personal assuts, or even give you personal information up. so why should you take the risk? just get off that computer! even if you dont meet on internet assuter you will still be glued to your computer cauzing it more likley to be harrased. i definatly dont want that for my family. the last reason is the most important to @percent of @location family. if you are spending all this time on your computer you will be out on in your family. this time is verry important because you never know when your family will be gone! and it is a verry scarry topic to think about. i know that most people in @location was spend all the time with there family. on another note a survey shows that @percent of children that spend time with there family and less than @num minutes on the computer have grades higher than @num in all classes. wouldn't you want to make the honnor role in your school? in conclusion, computers have a negiteve effect on people! spending most time on your computer can causes less time spent exercising, more danger/harm to people, and less time spent with your family. wouldn't you just rather spend less time on your computer? thank you for your time.
10 do you have computer at home that you go on? everyone goes on the computer for many different reasons with friends or for projects and @caps like that. computers can be good in many ways but they can not be. computers are made it do all @caps to help us learn. i personally think that computers are good. we can learn @caps that are going on from far away. an example is if we have a big project in @caps @caps about @location, and we dont know the computer can look all different focus and see pictures. computers can the history of place not us. i can sister talking how they had that has to be taken using a computer. the answer in the question world war @caps. she got a @percent we @month also be able to see whats going on with the @location and different place. all you have to do for that is go on the compute and look it up.  okay class today we will be going down in the computer to do some research.  said my teacher.  what are we going  @caps.  @caps that are going on the @location. all of these @caps can us research projects many other @caps. we can also use computers. computers also have different @caps. an example at the program can help us that they let us look information, play game, help with our homework. i have just realized that you can pretty much do anything you want on a computer. @caps shows that @percent of people in the @location go on the computer for help with their. i can remember my friend telling me that she always types her essays because its for her teacher and from typing. so the program is helpful to us. people always go on the computer and love @caps that are an save, at their. i usually do that so i know when a good is to an in the to buy what i want. well you should really consider thinking about this those cant even reasons the people in the @location.
10 @organization, @caps of people use computers @caps for many different types of things. computers are very beneficial to society. even though people @month use their computers too much, the tasks they complete help our world run smoothly. also, computers allow us to keep in touch with friends and family that we don't see anymore, and they teach us valuable information very quickly. without computers, society would not run as smoothly as it does now. one way that computers benefits our society, is that they complete tasks such as writing a paper, researching information,..etc, much quicker. for example, if you, the @organization, needed to quickly print an article in the paper on the devastating earthquake in @location, computers would greatly benefit you because they would allow you to type the article much quicker than having to handwrite it. computers are very beneficial to society because they allow us to complete things very quickly and efficiently. another reason why computers are very beneficial to society is because they allow us to maintain relationships with people from long distance and allow us to always keep in touch with old friends and family. moving to from about @date, computers have greatly helped and i stay halfway country. in a recent survey by @percent of college graduate a computer stay in town friends from stay in but allow you to actually see the are our society is beneficial by computers because they world. reason society is because they alloe people very quickly. search engines such as @organization, @organization, @caps, and more allows us to research anything we want to know at just the click of the button. this ability to know anything very quickly has agreat effect on people, without of this knowledge people becomemore intellectual and intelligent and with that intelligence, they make great things happen. according to @person, a computer scientist at @organization, the knowledge people get from computer search engines allows them to better do @caps things and achive more in thier lives . computers benefit society and have great effect on people when they are balanced our with other important things such as exercise and socializing. they teach us new information quickly, perform tasks, quickly and effeciently and allow us to keep in touch with people across the world. if it weren't for computers things would take longer to get done and society would become worse. we need computers to do @caps things and do tasks needed to live life. 
8 dear editor, @caps you think that people spending a lot of time on the computer is good, i don't. people should get more exercize. also they don't get enough fresh air. finnaly they don't spend enough time with family and friends. now we have to determin weather people should spend a lot of time on the computers. those people who spend alot of time on the computer could be going outside everyday to get exersize. some parents got their kids hooked on playing on the computer all day instead of going out side to get exersize. they could ride bikes, scooters, play basket ball, wiffle ball. they can also go swimming play, sports, and go to a play ground. finnally they could go for a long walk on the beach. people need to get fresh air instead of being on the computer all day. they can go sit on the beach for awile, go outside to watch their kids play or watch their games like baseball or basket ball, or they can go outside just to be outsides. they can go sit on their porch to wait for their kids to get off the bus from school. those people who love to play on the computor don't spend enough time with their family or friends. they could go visit their family more often, go out for lunch with their frinds. also they can spend more time doing things with their kids. even though there is a chat on the computer it is nice to talk to your friends in person. the time has come to decide weather people spending a lot of time on the computer is a bad thing or not. they don't ge enough exersize every day. they also don't get enough freshair. finally they spend time with their friends and family. so now you need to write a letter to your local newspaper telling them which you are choosing.
12 dear @caps: you recently posed a question in you newspaper. the @caps yourk @caps, asking if the readers were for or against technology. i support computers because they give one opportunity to learn about different people all over the world and their culture, they save massive ammounts of time in today's hustle-bustle society, and you can talk to people online via certain computer programs. with a computer one can learn scores of information about foreign countries and their culture. i read an article in the @caps @caps about a man who was participating in a church program in which a foreign citizan would come to @location for a while to make friends and learn about the @location. this man, @person, was assigned a from the farms of @caps who had never been out of the fields. @person thought @caps would be nice to welcome her in his house with a familiar setting. unfortunatley, he knew nothing about @caps. he did have a computer though which he quickly retreated to so he could learn everything about her home. when the woman stepped into his door, @caps was eastastic to feel like @caps was home again. @caps ended up staying with @person and getting married. if he had not charmed her with his knowledge from the computer. @caps might not have stayed and had a wonderful life with him. also, @person from @organization says that language students such as spanish and french have @percent higher success rate if they have a computer to learn more about the countries. he says the average grade for kids with a computer is an a. but the average grade for kids @caps a computer is a @caps+. therefore, having a computer to learn about faraway places and people can ensure happiness and succes in the future. computer also save a massive ammount of time. in the school newspaper, @person told about her homework problem.  @caps@number night i had @caps homework. i had vocals @caps is a galore to deal with. i had to look up @caps@number word in the huge dictionary, i was failing @caps because i just didn't have the time for my homework! then my family bought me a computer, @caps was so nice using the online dictionary. i could finish my homework in @num minutes compared to @num hours! i was finally doing well in @caps.  @caps her computer, @person would have to have and @caps @num. @caps would have just kept failing @caps her time-saving computer. also, @person says that @percent of people get to work faster when they look up traffic reports on the computer instead of listening in the radio. he says that @percent of people get a because their boss is so impressed with their consistent timing. as you can see, time is a valuable thing which computers can help save. finally, computer allow one to talk online. a student once had the misfortune to break one of his vertabrae. the doctor told him that he would not be able to participate in school for a. the student, @person, came up with a plan to speak to his teachers via his laptop and webcam. everyday, the teachers would give @person an update over his computer. when he finally marched back into school, @person barely had any work to make up because his teacher bad interacted with him over the computer. @caps his computer, @person would have a month's worth of work and learning to make up which would have been overwhelming. also, @person of @organization says that students that communicate with their families during college have better relationshops after college. obviously, being able to talk to some are over the computer is a useful thing to have. in conclusion, having a family computer is a very good thing. not only does @caps allow people to learn about places other than their home, @caps also gives us more time and allow us to talk to other withour ever leaving the comfort on home. i recommend that everyone who wants an easier life should invest in a computer.
9 dear @caps of @organization, @caps you know that eight out of ten homes in @location have at least one computer if not more? computers help us with daily things and make many tasks, like writing an essay, much easier. they benefit our society in many ways. without computers some families would lose contact with loved ones who are far away, not to mention it can keep many things very organized and neat easily. maybe the best benifit is how you can learn about far away countries and cultures with the click of a button. computers have endless posibilities to how they can benifit our society. many people don't realize that some families can not be with eachother so easily as other. if a family member is in the service somtimes talking on the computer is the only chance they get to commnunicate with their loved ones back home. saying that this is not a benifit is a lie. for others who don't have such sevier need of communicating it is still a convinient way to have a conversation with someone far away without racking up the phone bill for a long distance call. also many times this can be an altenative to parents buying their children expensive cell phones. so having a computer is defanitly a benifit to communiting. the computer can also make many tasks much esier, for example if you were assiangned a @num pages essay in school typing it on the computer would be much neater and quicker than writing it all out. also many buisnesses relay on computers to keep data organized and all in place. like the program excel, @organization created this to make a simple way to organize data. it is much more efficient than than having every thing in different site with millions of texters in every draw. so another benifit of the computer is that it can keep tthings organized and poride easy ways to complete evey day tasks. maybe the greatest benifit of the computer is how much you can learn so easily. say i was curiouse about the recent earthquake in @location, if i wanted more inofrmartion @caps head straight to the computer. you simply go to @organization or another search engine of your choice, type in the subject, one click, and bam you could read for hours all of the websites and articles that would come up. the computer is full of information, and is right at our finger tips, this is definitly a huge benifit to our socierty. the computer is a wonderful tool that can asist in so many ways, wether it is communication organization, or just curiosity. this advance in technology is just another way to improve every day life. computers don't just benifit our little town of @location, they benifit our whole socoety in all of the amazing things they do. 
9 dear local newspaper, @caps you can see, about @percent of our population over use the computer. they should be out getting fresh air and spending time with their family and friends. on the other hand, the computer can come with much use. for many people. family lives quite a distance away, @caps well @caps some friends and getting out of touch is a possibility. you can also learn about far away places, like @location. the computer is often used for projects essays which is important. you can learn quite a bit with a computer. the computer can be used in many ways. one way is to keep in contact. sure you can just go to the park and spend time there but not everybody live that close. for people who have relatives or even good friends who live quite a distance, a computer is what you @caps. it is a great way to keep in contact. you can keep everyday updated at all times. for example, my cousin recently went out of the country for college she will be there for a few months so she has her own blog on the computer to keep everybody update and stay in contact. the phone is not always an option. to learn about far away places is great. online you can learn about the history of specific places. you can see the towns and so much more. you can even see pictures. maybe one day you will even get to see those specific places in person. how cool would that be? school is a big thing now-a-days. students have project after project assay after essay and its a lot of work. @caps you grow older it becomes more work and with a computer, you will have less weight on your shoulders. with essays you can type them, and fix your mistakes without it looking sloppy. projects are easy to fix to: so messing up isn't a big deal. on the other hand, more americans now than ever before are over weight. the computer has a lot to do with that. most people will come home and sit on the computer for the rest of the evening. they don't realize what a big effect a computer can make on a person. more people should be out exercising. spending time with family. computers can be negative thing or positive. it can be more helpful than you could imagine. but, yet it can make a huge negative effect on people. it can help keep contact with people to learn about far away places, or even school work. let it be benificial, use it when you @caps it.
9 dear newspaper @caps, @caps you know that over @percent of @caps own computers? computers are one of technology's greatest and are sweeping the nation, as well as the world. as you can probrably tell, i believe that computers have positive effects on people. computers teach hand-eye coordination and create the ability to learn and research quickly and efficiently. and don't forget get that they offer ways to chat online. have you ever played a game of baseball where you just can't seem to just hit the ball? well, sounds like you need to work on your hand eye coordinator. studies have shown that @percent of people that use computers have an increased hand eye when doing activities like sports or games. so if you use a computer, you'll be hitting homeruns, not striking out. after you've won your baseball game, it's time for homework, and guess what? your teacher assigned a project that's due tomorrow! don't panic, get online! computers help you learn and research, which is faster than going to the library and getting a book. say you need the date olympic gold medalist @person was born, google it! finally, once you have your information all you have to @caps is your source. ok, now your homework is done and you want to talk to your friend about your plans on @date. computers offer numerous ways to chat online. there's @caps, @caps, @caps, wovoo, @caps, and many more. so you sign into @caps, and talk with your best friend. now your not bored anymore. computers are a great way to decrease boredom, just by talking with friends online, but you better go to bad soon because you have @organization's in the morning! as you can see, computers are incorporated into our daily lives. they're everywhere! i believe that they're changing society, mostly for the better. they teach hand eye coordination, help you research and learn, and let you chat with friends. additionally, if you don't already have a computer, then get one!
8 dear readers, i understand that some @month think computers can effect peoples' lives. this is because it causes them to not go outside excersising and enjoying nature. my point of view is that people have the choice to go out side, exercise, and enjoy nature. computers give so much information that it could give people ideas of fifferent activities people can do outdoors. computers also have abilities to download videos and other soft ware that people can look at and perform excersing with them, and learn techniques. in my life my mom and dad, and many other people im my family, look online at different websites to see what activities we can do on the weekends and seasonal activities. computers are very important and are life changing. if it wasn't for computers some people wouldn't be able to get an education. doctors, police officers, and banks use computers for thier job and it helps us go through are everyday lives with ease. from what i see and understand i that computers have a positive effect on our lives. computers can be negative but it all has to do with self control and how you use it.
8 dear @caps @caps, i think computers have a bad effect on people for three reasons. one they can really hurt your eyes, two it is not safe if you have little kids in your house. finaully three you will never see your family or friends if your on the computer. the first reason was computers have a bad effect on people is it can really hurt your eyes. if your always stareing at a computer screen all the time you can go blind. and with you having bad eyes you can get serious head injures just from hurting your eyes. the second reason why computers have a bad affects on people it is not safe if you have little kids in your home. like you can be watching adult movie that little kids are'nt aged enough to see if can have a bad effect and it has a bad effect on people because you will have no and if you have a little kid in your house he will always be in and he will probaly hear something really, really kid like music, @caps if you have a kid house the reason was computers have bad effects on people is that if your always on a computer you will never see your family and @caps if you are always on the computers you will miss out on the and will never you never see and don't @caps a rent on on the computers. @caps what you look and keep the little kid with you in the house. and last get off the computer and go see your family and friends. 
10 letter to the @caps i disagree with the so-called  experts  that claim that computers could have negative effects on people. the idea that you socialize less with family and friends is a pathetic arguement. social networking sites like @caps or @caps allow @caps with all your friends @caps and other online games help you met new people that could be hundreds of miles away from you! twiter is good when you just want to say something quick like  @caps to @location . @caps allows you to talk to friends, comment on their videos, and subscribe to them, plus it provides hours of entertainment without a fee. computers also can provide fun games and entertain users. there are many free games, like @person, that have endless possibilities. @person @person (made by @caps) claims to be the most popular @caps (@caps @caps online @caps@number @caps) on the web. you can level up combat skills: attack, defence, strength, ranged, and magic. or you can level up skills like wood cutting, prayer, farming, fishing, mining, and cooking. @person, like most @caps, has quests, with varying difficulties. for example, for one quest you have to kill a demon, but for another, just find a missing cat. there are over @num quests, and there are never fewer than @num people playing at a time. some other notable @caps games are @organization @caps: @caps, @caps of @caps, @organization, @location, and @organization. as you can see, the computer has an impressive list of entertaining @caps for all ages, not to mention sites like @caps or addicting games. computers don't really affect exercising. that's a personal choice, so you have to choose between @caps or the basketball court. it's like saying that before we had computers or video @caps consoles, that a @caps@number board stopped kids from exercising. the computer doesn't actually stop us from exercising. it's our minds that do, and our judgement. if you have bad judgement, you'd stay inside all day tweeting and @caps. with a good strong mind and willpower, you can overcome a bad decision and play sports or go to the gym. all it takes is good judgement. just to recap what i've said, @caps is plenty on computers and there are many choices on how to do it. many sites amuse us, and we should make use of that. not to mention you can buy games like @caps of @caps or @organization @caps: @caps for your @caps! computers don't actually hinder exercising, all it takes is good judgement to get off that chair and exercise.
11 dear @caps @caps @caps, @caps having everything known to man at your fingertips. @caps having an endless source of information in your own home. wouldn t you want all of this all the time? the question then is, do computers have positive effects on people? i strongly believe computers do benefit society. firstly, computers teach you hand-eye coordination. the main way is by typing. when you type, you start of looking at the keys but eventually you memorize all the locations of the keys. also, computer games teach hand-eye coordination. if you weren't looking at the screen, would it be possible to win the game? when computers teach you hand-eye coordination, you can use it for other things too. for example, you definitely need it in sports or more. specifically, baseball. if you didn't have good hand-eye coordination, you wouldn't be able to catch the ball or be able to hit the ball when you swing. hand-eye coordination very important. secondly, computers give people the ability to form about places and people. when people are deciding when to get vacation, they go in the internet. what there is in do. why would you travel in a place is you back. many use the internet in research other countries. when the eight grade did reports their information. eighty seven percent the internet. finally; some people say computers take away from interaction with family and friends, but computers actually allow you to tell with other family and friends around the world. wouldn't it be wonderful to with your loved ones in a different state of country? the main way of online communication is @caps-mail or @caps @caps. these allow you to send someone a message faster and easier. it is much easier in remember someone @caps-mail address than it is a phone settle for just talking, when you can actually see the person? it would be like them being in the room with you. computers are a great way to talk to someone. why wait any longer? computers are a great way to refine your hand-eye coordination skills. you can research faraway people and places to see what life is like around the globe. most importantly, you can communicate with family and friends online through @caps, @caps-mail, or @caps@number definitely, computers benefit society. so go and share this information with other people to convince them that computers are positive.
8 computers have many effects on people these days. most of them are very good effects that can lead you to become more self-confident. computers can educate people, from learning about some ancient person to doing school projects. also computers entertain people too. lastly it can even increase you chances of finding a job or helping out your job. for most people education is very important to but since kids don't stay in school @num they use the computer to teach to kids kids can learn about other places. this benefits us because we're learning something and growing out our knowledge. also kids can do their projects. for example writing on essay, their science fair project and so on. lastly kids can learn about people from other times. for example famous musicians long ago, celebrities, legends, hall of famers etc. people always look for some kind of entertainment and the first place they ever go is the computer. everyone likes enetertainment and the computer in the the best plan. they could play a variety of games. games from the past or gaems from the future. there is also a whole bunch of : multiplayer, figure, castle defense, shnaler sports, racing, acade, and so on. another fun thing to do is interact with friends online or even talk to any family don't live near you. lastly, you could watch funny videos, sad videos and music videos. another that computers effect people is their of finding or help on their . the computer can teach people what they will do on their job, and what to expect. also, it can let you search for jobs. in your. finally, it can help them for allowing them to a web page. in conclusions computers have people. it can increase their education, give them entertainment, and even help out on their job, or help them find a job.
10 to whom it @month concern: i will agree that computers have caused many people to spend less time outside. however, it has kept kids inside instead @organization on the streets causing trouble. computers have become a part @organization our everyday life. some use it to stay connected with family or to reconnect with old friends. experts say it's bad but the @organization gives us a computer class in @organization? we learn keyboarding skills. @organization techniques and how to research any topic. @organization, itself has influenced computer use. if we could travel back in time, we would most likely see kids hanging around the streets. now-a-days, kids spend a lot @organization time inside, on the computers. this isn't necessarily a bad thing. i bet you, or your parents, or maybe even your grandparents used to hear @organization gangs or fights going on in the streets. now that computers have become an important item in many people's lives you don't hear those types @organization things as much. i'm not saying they don't happen but you don't hear your child come home and talk about gangs and fights. therefore, being on the computer isn't that bad. in history you probably learned about immigrants coming over to @location to get away from their ruler. well, not everyone was able to come. some people have family in another country. due to time difference, it is hard to stay in touch. my mother came over here when she was @num. the rest @organization her family still lives in @location. to stay in touch they email or @caps chat. the five hour time difference makes it difficult to know when to call. the invention @organization computers has made it easier to catch up with family! most importantly, the use @organization computers is influenced in schools. my @organization, @organization, has a computer class, where we learn how to skillfully type. we are also taught how to correctly cite and research work. this is helpful because if we don't know this information we could plagiarize and plagiarism is illegal. frequently, teachers give us projects that ask for computer use.. either we have to look something up for specific, accurate information or we have to type a @organization document. as well as using the the online @caps book instead @organization taking it home. after reading all the facts, i'm sure you will agree that computers can benefit society. students stay off the streets and only cause trouble with siblings at home. people won't feel like they've left or lost their family. schools influence computer use to help us learn. certainly you cannot disagree with me!
8 deear newspaper, i think that the effects that computers are having on people is a @caps thing because most people just sit at the computers all day long. in this letter i am going to talk about the effects of computers on people, what we could be doing instead, and what person are doing on the computer. first thing is that computers are having a @caps effect on people and there life computers are making people just fit inside on their computers all day and do nothing. they just sit there playing games also about @percent of the people who are spending to much time on the computer are probally pating well their on the computer which that is why some people @month be fat. most of the people who spend all of they time on the computer is people in there @num's and @num's some are in there @num's or @num's. just sitting there on the computer will get you. where in life. it will not give you a job or school education. by just sitting at the computer for a while you will not be able to do things out side. if so many people were not on the computer all the time then they could be outside. being outside they can play sports, ride bikes, swim, run and more. they could also get a job and make some money or go to college, kids who are on the computer to much could get out and go to the mall, hang with friends you could get some exercise, or just enjoy nature. there is no use for going on the computer and being there for more then @num or @num hours, the most you should be on the computer would be an hour to an hour and a half. kids and teenagers should only go on the computer for homework and the rest of the time doing something eles. well all of the kids grade through @num grade should go out a play with their toys and people @num grade and up should hang out with and do thing like go to the mall, see a movie, or just have a sleepover. also everyone in these grades should interact with there families more by seeing them more then @num/@num times a month and they could have parties or just get together and hang out. so people should do some of the other things i said instead of just going on the computer all of the time. the last thing is the things that people are doing on the computers which is like i sometimes go on facebook. other people go on facebook, google, games looking up information, and more. they also have emails where they chat with other people. another thing people go on is youtube and listen to music and watch veidos. so i don't think that the effect of the computers on people is a good thing. i think that people shoud be out doing things then just sitting at home on the computer. people who sit at home on computers could and probally will get to fat. so the effect of computers on people is @caps.
8 dear @caps @caps, i think that computers have a positive effect on people. you can do lots of stuff with computers such as help people learn new things almost about everything. also, there are some programs on the computer where they allow you to talk to other people. also, for adults, they can take care of some finances and bills online and some taxes. i think computers definitely have a positive effect on people. a lot of people use their computers to learn new stuff about other things and people. nine out of ten people go on the computer at least more than once a month to learn about something new. also, kids in school use computers all the time for school work and to learn about new things. kids in school use computers in school all the time for projects and experiments and they learn new stuff about people and things in the world. computers definitely have a positive effect on people when they learn new things. another great things about computers is that there are programs that allow you to talk to other people. eight out of ten people talk to another person almost every day on the computer. this is a good thing because they re able to talk to friends and family from a long distance and enjoy themselves. it is also a good thing because if family moves away you can still talk to them from a computer. another positive effect computers have for you is that adults can pay bills and finances on the computer also. seven out of ten adults pay bills online at their computer. this is a good thing because adults have to do it by hand, now they can just do it on the computer, which is definitely a positive effect on a person! i think computers definitely have a positive affect on people in many ways. they help people learn new stuff about things and. also, they allow you to talk to friends and family over the internet. and finally, they allow you to do finances and pay the bills online instead of by hand. there are many ways still computers have a positive affect on people, i ve only stated just a few of them. i hope you take my side about my opinion about computers and that they definitely have a positive affect on people.
4 dear @caps @caps, i think that computers are bad because you will be wonign to do no homework because people are playing to much computers and they are getting aditivf to the computers and it is dayise because you mit be talking to people that you don't now on thr computer and it is the vary dagis because it is the sam thing as haveing a myspace on teh computer it is vaery dangish because ther are dad people that be going on the computer and people be pating bad stuf on the computer.
9 have you ever had someone move away and you wanted to keep in touch? well having a computer allows this to happen. @caps, it gives students the to learn different places. people and much more. but why do some people not hire them? first computers allow you to talk online with friends and family. for example using email, @caps and video chat for example i have a friend who moved away and now we email back and forth to keep in touch. @caps allows people to chat instintly and upload pictures and videos. for examples my @caps @caps pictures of my baby cousins so people can see how their growing up. lastly, some buessnesses use a webcam to talk to other people. say the boss on a the but to see how he employees were doing withness him he could hook up a web cam and have a conversation with them. that is how computers allow people to the @caps, computers @caps people to learn about things, for example if a student rod to make a topic they could type the topic a website like bring or google and they could find all the answers they needed to help them with their project. @caps if a family wanted to go on to see they could search for it and find a hotell and sites they might want to see that is how computer allows people so that the reader can read their hand writing. @caps they help pay taxes. for example, turbo tax is an online program that allows people to pay taxes online and it remembers every tax you have paid. so if some company sends you a notice saying you havent payed a bill you can go on turbo tax and check. so reader these are some ways why people should enjoy computers. they allow people to talk to friends and family by email, @caps, and @caps by webcam. they @caps give people the ability to learn information faraway places and people. lastly what is so bad about having a computer? they allow people to pay taxes online and @caps type papers. computers are needed in this day and age or else some people would not be able to survive without them. so reader these are some reasons why people should easily computers.
6 dear @caps, @caps, some people do spend most of the day on the computers, but not everyone. oh, let me start with no. not all people take atvantege of the computer. like scientest, your banks, and schools. these tipe of computers helps us through life. with out these computers then we willl still be cluless on a lot of things. but, there are people out there that did take atvantege of the computers. and they still do. with unforgiving acks like child porn. one of our mane problem in the world is child porn. and a lot has to do with the kidnapping. or in rare cases the parents are the cause of it. so these are a lot of changes that need to be doen. but when there cleared then the computer world will be peacful once agaen.
7 i do not beileve that computers benefit society. kids can learn more but they spend too much time on line. when kids talk to people on line they don't know if it is really someone you know. there are techneral problems with them that deileate files. for these reasons is why computers do not benefit society. kids spend too much time on computers. computers do teach you more things, but they also have games. children spend most of their time on games than studying. chidren can get agressive when loss of exersise. thats what is happening today. kids are loosing exersise an are getting hevier. they can evan loose intrest. all they want to do is go on the computer. kids talk to people, how do they know who they really are? people can make a fake e-mail adress and make a false account on @caps or @caps-space. these people want children's personal information. also if you are talking to someone that has a name of someone you know. the person just might be a freand. like me. i was talking to @caps cousin on @caps (the account said his name) but it was his wife. that is why you need to be carful about what you say and who it is you are really talking to. computers have virouses. when computers get virouses, they can deilete the files you want to save. if you had a video on the news you want to keep it. youu put it under favorates, they you get a virouse that deleites the file. the video is how off the wedsite. sometimes your computer doesn't bring you to the wed anymore. you how have to click alot of places to get there. for these resons is why computers are not benefical to society. kids spend to much time on computers. kids can talk to people they don't know on them. computers have technical problems that delete files. just remember there are many many more resons why computers are not benefical to society.
11 would you like to discover new things and explore amazing mysteries around the world? do you love to have friends overseas? do you want to relax and do something fun after @organization? advanced technology today allows you to do almost everything that would have been considered impossible @date decades @date. we need to decide whether computers have positive or negative effect on people. i firmly believe computers gives society many benefits and opportunities. who would disagree that computers are devoted to educational purposes? computer experts have invented countless programs that make @organization easier for kids. for example, @caps helps you with essays and reports. with her program teachers wouldn't hurt their eyes trying to read sloppy hand written compositions from students @organization helps you organize and calculate, @organization gives you the @organization to create dynamic presentations. many schools have a computer lab for students to complete their @organization tasks. @organization has also aquired convenient-sized laptops to help students do their projects and take test. that saves a lot of paper and a lot of trees! furthermore, many colleges offer their courses online. you can obtain a college degree right at your house without going anywhere. education has never been so easy, thanks to our advanced network and computers. it is very important to mention the entertainment benefits of computers. i have notices many teens play cool games on the net. they seem to greatly enjoy this opportunity. it in an ideal way to relax after a stressful way getting on the computer and listening to the newest songs. some websites after downloadable songs for free so you don't need to worry about the financial part. moreover you can watch movies online anytime, form wide section such as horror, romance, comedy, fantasy or even children films. no more movie tickets, no more driving in the theater. without a doubt computers can put a single on everyone's face with its entertainment benefits. many people feel that computers both kids and adults always from their social life, but actually, computers give them a chance to communicate with other people around the world. ten @date @date, who would have thought that they could chat and talk directly with same one a thousand miles @date, with no mail or telephone or whats over? i came to the @location @date. i am extremely grateful to computers because i can keep in touch with my friends and relatives. i can just send them pictures of the snowy winter sceneries here through just a minute. how much easier could it get? computers definitely improve communication and brings people closer. let's not wait any longer. computers have endless positive effects and should be popularizeas. they help you learn have fun and communicate with people faraway. above and beyond all that new technology makes the earth a greener place by saving paper and trees. don't sit here and wait educate people about the benefits of computers today.
9 computers were built to help the people make tasks easier and quicker. since then, they have been updated over and over untill what they are today. computers are a part of most peoples everydaylives, and essential to most bussiness.but the common question in our society is, are computers really benefitting us? my answer is yes. computers do many things for us. they teach us hand-eye coordinatin, give us the ability to research effectivly, and recently, became a great way of communication, @caps's are definately benefitting us. one reason why computers help us is by teaching hand-eye coordination. in a magazine i read, one expect, (@person) said that leading to type without looking is a great way of improving reflexes. the speed that you type is improved with practice. another way it improves hand-eye coordination is by learning to click and react to different things effectively. i often on being ammused by playing games on the computer. these games usually are hard, but with my improving hand-eye coordination, i am learning how to play these games well. my father always tells me to learn my way through a computer because they are our future, soon, mostly everything will be done by them with the improving technokolgy, it is impossible for it not to be benificial to our society. our home computers have been great at teaching me thing like hand-eye coordination. another reason why computers are great is by making that tough history paper, just a click away. my garndfather always tells me how easy i have it. instead of going to the @caps and having to pick out a book, i just go to google and have an entire search engine infront of me. when we go into highschool we will need a computer to suceed. to keep our essays organized, our research effective, and the clear to read typing right infront of us. my brother tells me that having a computer is the best investment has ever made. last year, we had a science assignment to figure out how our heart beats faster. this way very easy considering i typed it in and had hundreds of ways to increase my pulse rate. computers have changed the way we research and finish school works. the last reason why computers are fantastic is beacuse they make communication just a click away. a couple weeks ago, my coach emailed us that our gametime has changed. this doesn't seem like a big thing, but without his @caps, we would've missed the game. my cousin @caps is from @location. me and him meet only once a year. with that limited time, we can't really get out what we need to. recently, i bought a webcam and have been chatting with him on it every week. it is almost like he's with me. all the girls in our school can't get enough of me. so i get home after sports, go on, and theres always enough of me to go around. webcamming is a great way of communication. with all the new computer going on sale and new appliances coming no one knows when it will stop. well, the question still lingere, are computers benificial to our society? the answer @month never come about, but at least for me, improving hand-eye, researching being a breeze, and communication just waiting for me is a pretty sweet deal. so for now, i stand by the opinion that computers are great, and extremely useful to everyone.
11 @city @caps, computers are very helpful devices. life would be very hard without them. not only are the helpful, but they are fun and easy to use! i believe that computers have a great effect on people because you can keep in touch with family and friends, go on school websites and use search engines. friends and family are extremely important in peoples lives. computers can help you keep in touch with them! the @num applications that i mostly use are @organization, @caps, and @caps. @organization is a free online application that you can download to your computer, add your friends, and video chat! using this, i keep in touch with my @caps, my friend who moved, and even a friend from @location! @caps (@organization instant messeger) is where you can send messages to friends and get instant replies! it is just like text messaging, only through computers. lastly, @caps is a website where you can add friends from all around the world! i am friends with tons of family that i don't get to see very often, a friend who moved to @location, and many other people that have moves! @caps, @caps, and @organization are great ways to keep in touch with other people! when you are home sick from school and need to make up school work, instead of calling a friend from each of your classes, go to the school's webpage! all teachers should have their own website that you can get from there. on their pages, they should have posted homework, quizzes/tests schedule, favorite links, projects, and their e-mail address. i find this very helpful because even if you don't understand you homework, you can e-mail you teacher! not only do school website have teachers pages, but they also have lunch menus, events coming up, the school address and phone number, and many more! school could be a lot more difficult without a website. do you ever have a question but nobody has the answer to it? www.google.com has the answer to everything! you can find webpages, videos, pictures, translators, etc. google is not the only search engine on the internet, there is also @caps, @organization!, @location, @caps, @location, etc. these can all help you find answers, pictures, videos and many more! i often use these to find pictures for a school project, webpages for research, translators to check my spanish homework and videos to show my friends! if we did not have search engines, life would be a lot harder. computers, as you can tell, are extremely helpful, easy, and fun to use. people love them and use them all the time. i hope that you agree with computers having a great effect on people! staying in touch with family and friends, having a good education, and finding answers within a click is the easiest way to go!
8 computers have a positive effect on peoples lives. they are big helpers. they teach you skills you need in life. the technology abilities help us with tasks every day. finally they help people to keep in touch and meet knew people. i think that computers have a very positive effect on our lives. computers teach us many things. first of all just learning how to use the computer is a skill you need in life. at most jobs you have to know how to work a computer. today computers are essential part of most work enviornment. hand-eye coordination is another skill the computer teaches you. computers actually help you with sports in a way. to catch a ball you need hand-eye coordination. the technology the computer gives us helps us alot in life. if you need directions you can look it up on the computer. if you couldn't you would have to call the resturant for directions. without the computers help we would all have to write all of our papers out. for students it would be a nightmare to have to do reports without a computer. we would have to read so many books to get the information. the world would be a much different place without computers. sometimes people who we love have to move far away from us. it's hard to keep in touch on the phone when that happens. the computer through keep you in touch. with programs like facebook, twitter, and @organization, its possible. you can chat with them pictures of how there doing. you could even keep in touch with them from @location. computers almost anything possible. in conclusion computers are great machines. they teach us life long lessons. they help us when we need something or have to do a report. computers even keep people in touch so their relationships don't fall apart. i don't know about you, but i think computers keep the world up and running.
8 dear newspaper, i think that computers have a negative impact on society. i say this because it alows kids to be bullied at all hours of the day, it takes away from their exercise, and it gives then less time to study and do school work. overall, i think that talking is the main use for computer. but, some times it is used in the wrong way, @caps. experts say that @num out of every @num kids have thing to use to talk on line, but the also say that @num in @num of thoes kids are bullyed on line. also every year you hear someone or them, well most of the time it is because of @caps. in fact i heard on the news that half of their kids were bullyed online. and because you can go on at all hours of the day, kids can get bullied at any time. some child say that kids are happy when they go ho,e because they cant be buuyed but @caps be bullyed at their safe place, their home. another bad thing about the computer is that it replace exercise. a text a and @caps football scout said  every year their are less less people who play sports because of video game or computers.  @caps the obesity rate of kids has gone up in america and many agree that the cause computers taking place of exercise. also people think that you get better hand eye coordination but most leaders agree that you don't because it is not your hand that is moving it is your mouse. lastly, noe grades are lower then ever for students. most teachers say that @num in @num students get good grades and they say that all @num that don't spend to much time all the computer. i was waching discovery chanel and it said that @caps most kids are spending @num hours on the computer and less than @num hour on studying or homework. the computer made for storing information and learning. how did we let it go from that to a tool wed for @caps, making lazy kids, and for anti-learning!
8 dear @caps of the newspaper, i understand you think computers don t have an effect on people. computers do have an effect on people. for one reason the computer helps people find out information about anything. also, it helps people do work. plus, you can comunicate with anyone you want. dont make any decitions before thinking about these effects on people. first of all, computers helps people find information quicly. to find information everybody uses either google or ask and many more. the information that people find would probably help them find were a store is or a number for a restaurant. not just that but, you can find at how much something is at a store and if it is on sale or not. these are just some of the great effects computers have on people. however, work is a really large effect computers have on people. for example, computers would really help someone if they are looking for a job because their are many stores you get to choose from. to go along with that, adults and children use the computer to type something on word if its for a report for work or an essay in school. maybe you have used the computer to type information for your newspaper. yet, one thing kids love to do on the computer is comunicate with their friends. most kids either use facebook, @caps, or oovoo to comunicate. having these programs helps kids stay in touch with friends that moved away. plus, one thing good about these programs are if you have family that live very far away from you, you can always talk to them at any time. i understand why you think computer dont have an effect on people. computers do have many effects on people. thats not all, computers help people find what their looking for. it also helps you with your work. never the less computers are a great way to comunicate with friends or family. think long and hard about what decition that you want to make.
9 dear local newspaper, i have herd that some people do not agree that computer benefit our society. well in this letter i am going to give you three reasons how computers do benefit our society. those reasons are @num) people have friends and family in other states @num) some people use them to stay organized and @num) computers help you learn more. i hope that by the end of this letter you will see that computers do benefit our society. first of all, i think that computers benefit our society because @caps lets people @caps in contract with family and friends in other states. this is true that you could use the phone and call them out you have to pay for long distance. you don't have to pay anything to email somebody. i know from experience because, i have friends and family in a lot of states in the @location  @caps computers help me stay in contact with my family all over  @person ( @organization ) @caps many people use the computer the contact with loved ones everyday. some people even on them to stay in touch with family or at war. next i believe that computers benefit society because @caps keeps people organized. i know this many not seem like a big deal but a lot of people or computers to @caps things organized @caps they know how everything is would happen if didn't have computers to @caps all of the appointment in? well i will tell you what would happen to @caps all would end appointment would @caps giving you things you already got.  i @caps @caps on my computers - @person and @caps, i strongly belive that computers benefit our society because they help people learn more. yes @caps is right that not everybody goes on the computers to learn but that doesn't mean they don't learn. here's a cuple examples is @num) @caps - @caps lets you learn song lyrics, dance moves and more (@num) @caps - @caps lets you learn what other people like, don't like and @caps on. then there is face book, @caps lets you see what people are doing that day.  people learn everything to the computer  @caps @person. now i hope you see that computers don't benefit our society than that is your opinion. i hope you see what i see now.
10 dear @caps @caps readers, some of you might think people exercise computers. they don't act outside enough or interact with family or pets. you also @month think that they are not getting enough exercise.well you are right but i am going to explain way your wrong. you can do things like learn, socialize, and actually become healthy. the first thing you could do is learn. while you are on the internet you can go to learning websites. some of thoes websites can teach you about faraway places like @location, @organization, @location and many more. you can also learn about people and their cultures. take @caps @caps for example, you could learn their culture and the @caps they celebrate and why. another thing you could do is take online classes if you are having trouble in school. another thing you could do so the computer is socialize. you might think or say that when you are on the computer you cant socialize with family and friends. well you can. there are websites like @caps and facebook where all you do is talk to family and friends. now you can webcam people. when you webcam you can see the person whom you are talking to you can hear them and they could hear you through a microphone on the webcam. lastly you could go into chatrooms like @caps ( aol instant message ) and talk to people while you are on that sight. the last thing you can do is become more healthy. is it not surprising? yes, you can go onto websites that teach you day by day how to eat right and exercise. websites like @person esang.com car give you a might eating schedual right for your . after that website you could go out and get the you will need. another thing that the computer offers is hand-eye coordination. while you are looking at the screen your had is controling the   mouse  while the, mouse controls where you go on the worldwide web. lastly you will eventually want to go outside after visiting websites that show you moments and gardens of this world. so now hopefully you agree with me that computers do acctually benift some things in life. i have showed you what you can learn about, talk to people and socialize and lastly help you with your health. 
10 i have relized that there as been a disagreement about computers the positive and negative effects on people. it seems to me, in my opinion that computers have more of a negative affect on people than positive. i believe tat people are spending too much time on the computer and not exercizing, they don't spend quality time with family & friends and need to get fresh air and enjoy nature. although computers are a great piece of techology, many don't get outside to enjoy the nature & fresh air because their computers are inside their homes. this is not good because when you go outside, it helps skin health from the sunlight & lets in fresh air for your lungs. in addition, a walk outside to enjoy nature wouldn't hurt either. it can relieve stress & can be relaxing. furthermore, it is obvious when people are on the computer, they usually block out what their friends & family are saying to them. people can lose track of time & be on the computer for hours. instead you should use this time to be with your friends and family. being with your family can make your bond between each other stronger and you can get along with each other better. also, having a nice family time is a good way to help be with your family. @num out of @num experts say that eating a family dinner can help a child's grades & prevent them from using drugs or dropout of high school or college. finally, kids are more obese than us because they don't get enough excersize. at least @percent or more kids are obese from recent studies. due to this; this can lead to bone & joint issues, heart diseaase, lung problems, diabetes and athsma. these issues above are serious health problems if not treated. if kids excercize instead of being on a computer all day, the number of obese kids will drop drastically. excersize can help kids' self esteem, and get them back in shape. they can either play sports or even take a walk or run. there are many different things you can do to excersize and its fun for kids. unquestionably, there is definitely more reasons why there is a negative affect on kids/adults due to computers for the reasons above and more. computers prevent people from enjoying nature to get fresh air. likewise, they also prevent families & friends to spend time with each other and lastly, it isnt allowing kids to excersice which can lead to obesity.
8 dear @caps @caps @caps, i understand that more and more people use computers, and that can have a good side and a bad one. do you go on the computer for hours every day? that could be bad. i believe computers are good thing, but only if they are used properly. hopefully when i'm done, you'll see where i'm coming from on this matters. everyone is on the computer these days. the problem is, many people are on way too much. they say they are working on hand-eye coordination, but in reality they are wasting away their lives on a chair. they do not communicate as much with the rest of the household and that does not make a big, happy family. they say they are getting important information, but in truth, they might just be getting false information and viruses. bad people are out there, and one might hack into your computer and ruin your day. things like @caps @caps and @caps could have people that want to find out all about you so they can hurt you. yes, being on the computer definitely has a bad side. but there is a good side as well. that is, as long as you are not on too much. it does improve hand-eye coordination, if you play the right games. and it can teach you things, too. many websites have true information about place or things so you don't need to see it to know about it. you can be helpful. it is also an easy way to purchase items. you can just order them. most importantly, you can have fun. so, what is your side on this argument? do you think way too many people are on the computer. or do you think computers can be great, as long as you're careful? i, for one, pick the latter one. what about you?
8 dear local news paper, i think computers can have a bad effect on people from a really early age. starting at thirteen and up through adulthood. people spend hours at a time on the computer when they canbe exercising or doing some type of activity out doors. computers can make some people feel like life is being taken away form them. spending so much time on a computer can really damage a person posture. it is said that when some get on a computer a state of comfortbility comes over them and they lean over with their backs bent and they there for periods of time. imagin a person being cramped in a tight space for eight hours and when that person gets out they all their joints and muscles being stretched from that point of tensions. this is what we do to our bodys when we get on computers.
8 dear local newspaper editor, more and more people are using computers, but not everyone thinks that is such a good idea. those who support advances in technology believe that computers have a positive effect on people. other experts disagree. i think that computers do have a positive effect on people because they let you learn about anything all over the world, they let you talk online with other people, and teach hand eye coordination. i think that computers are very helpful. dont you love having the oppritunity to research anything from any part of the world that you want to learn about? i'm sure that everyone who has a computer does. with computers, you can use search engines like, google, yahoo, ask, and so many more. i know that computers help me with research all the time when i do projects or write papers for school. the internet is a great, reliable that you cango to when researching a topic for shcool or even just looking for an answer to a simple question. my next reason is that computers let you talk to other people online. things like facebook, email, myspace, and web-caming all let you communicate with people anywhere in the world. for example, i have an aunt that lives in @location, and on christmas me and my family used my cousins webcam to see her and talk to her when we couldnt be with her on a special holiday. also, things like facebook and myspace let you put up pictures and chat with friends and family all over the world. my last reason why i think computers have a positve effect on people is that playing on the computer is a good leisure time activity. there are all kinds of fun games you can play, and some even let you compete with other people around the world. for example, internet checkers is a game that lets you compete against someone else. there are so many websites that let you pick games you want to play out of a huge selection. its obvious that computers have a positive effect on people for research, talking to friends & family and leisure activities. i hope you agree with me!
8 computers. theres fun. but there's also a down side. people spent more time on it than outside or exersizing or even getting together with friends and family. but on ther hand, they're also fun, help kids, and even help get together from dating sites. it makes them happy. it's fun! computers are fun. they provide a wide arrow of games, educational can just plain fun. you can play role playing games (which and fun because i play a few myself), or you could play educational games like the games on islands, or other downlodabal education games that are, @caps not fun but essential for the growth and development of a learning child. they also can help kids learn how to and other things at a very early age. some very adults have and various other things that i cannot the life of me think of @caps thing computer get them together and they are happy. they do this hundreds of a day. take away computers and people will die alone and sad. so in conclusion my ideas where! fun help kids and help older people get together. read this and @caps sure you'll see it my way.
8 i personally believe that computersdo benefit society in a lot of ways. it can give you all the information you need with just a click of a button, entertainment is easy to find by searching the internet, and most importantly, it improves communication between people. one way computers benefit society is, by making it easier for everyone to get information about something. this is needed, especially in school. it can help kids get their information about the person they are writing about in their report.getting information easily on the internet can also help people in other ways. what if someone needed to get the hospital's phone number in case of an emergency? he can use the computer to help him find that phone number. another way computers benefit society is by allowing us to get any form of entertainment easily. this is what majority of the people in our society rely on. alot of people use the computer to play games, listen to music, and watch online videos. if someone was bored right now, he or she could use the computer to play fun games. what if that person thought it was a little quiet in his or her room? he or she could then use the computer to listen to music. without computers we would probably be really bored for the rest of our lives. finally, and most importantly, computers help improve communication between people. this is probably what everyone uses the computer for. now you can send electronic mail to your friends in just seconds, post and view pictures of your family or relatives and you can even use an instant messanger to write to your friend and get messages from your friend in the fastest speed possible! without computers, communication between others would be very hard. as you can see, computers can give you information easily, entertainment is not hard to find, and it can even improve communication between people around our society and the world.! computers are very helpful to us and improves everything about the way we live.
8 dear local newspaper, i was reading this article about computers. i agree with kids and adults not having time enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. but, also, kids and adults should be having some fun time outside and enjoying it. but when it comes to usage of computers is helpful for searching information. i think kids and adults need to get active and get healthy, because now kids don't want to play outside, so they can play outside, so they can play video games. when i was a little kid i would always play hide and seek but now my mother doesnt like to play anymore because of technology she rather be on the computer or on the phone. kids all over the world now know how to use computers because they don't want to be outside. computers are only helful when your doing a report or something, important. for example, people that have businesses they are going to need computers. also when a teacher a sighs a project on someone your going to need a computer to search up information for that person. finally alot of kids aren't taking responsibilty of school. they don't that school serious. kids think that the computers will teach you everything well there wrong because things on the computer can be made up. but its also making there life very in healthy. so thats why computers are good usage and bad at time because kids don't play outside anymore and computer are helpfull for searching information so with. what i've sadi don't you agree with me?
8 dear @caps, @caps don't have an affect on people because you can play games, webchat, and watch hilarious videos on the computers. also, you can use the computers for a research project or you can use the @caps for some facts on @caps people like @person, @person, and @location. also, who would want to get of their @caps and exercise, exercising is so boring and lame. second, who would like to especially enjoy the nature, walking through the woulds is so boring, you'll be walking through mud, ticks will be all over body, mosquitoes will try and bite you when you sweat. when kids get older, they mostly don't want to interact or spend time with their family, they want to spend time with their friends everyday. also, they mostly want to use technology to. kids will spend time texting on their cellphones when they're not in the mood for calling. thirdly, computers do give you hand-eye coordination it teaches you how to type without looking down at the keyboard. computers also teach you how to set you fingers on the home row for the keyboard. finally, @caps really do benefit society because you can use this technology in middle school, high school, and through college. when you get older you'll be learning more about these kinds of technology. also, kids could teach their parents how to use computers if their parents don't know how to. teaching you parents how to use @caps is a great responsibility for your actions.
7 in my own opinion i think that people should get less time on computers more time exercising, enjoying, nature, and interacting with family and friends. if people spend time on computers they will not get off and be stuck on computers then spending time like going to the park, or the mall. for my second opinion that people should not get off of computers because it they ever leave somewhere far they are not to be able to contact you. if you on the computer you could get a computer that say's a free labtop then you could take it far like: on a airplane to north carolina, or virginia, or wasington @organization, or a party, or a road trip, or on a ferry boat to the long island sound. for my third opinion that i agree people should not be off of computer because they might plan a trip to a far away place or a new house, or planing a anerveriry, or a new spot for a hunny moon a gorgest place like ona peek hill or at a hotel with a bed shape like a heart. for my fourth paragraph that i agree that people should not be off of computers that the count a location than person house or a location where they might be for that particular spot where that person is. for the fifth paragraph that i agree that people should not be able to get off of computers. i tell you why planning a birthday party for there child, or going to someone house for a visit like to tennessee. or going to @caps @caps to see a basketball team and @caps.s a another team and they are call @caps @caps lakers us caverlars. my conclusion is that people should not to be able to get off of computer.
8 dear to @caps this @month concern, computers do a whole lot now of days. you can play games, do homework, socialize but don't you think there are better things than that. such as exercising, enjoying the beauty of nature, and most importantly interacting with family and friends. these are all the things that computers take away from people. once you get onto a computer you never want to get off. if you look at it, it doesn't take much work and energy to use a computer. so if you eat and use the computer all day your not really burning any calories therefore you will gain weight. computers make people feel lazy sometimes therefore they spend less time exercising. that is not good for your health at all. exercising gives you energy and is good for you. have you ever looked out the window and saw how beautiful nature is? when your on the computer chit-chatting with people and playing online friends do you think about what your missing. everytime i use the computer i wish i could be outside playing and enjoying nature. trees, flowers, plants, grass and lots of other things are what make up the earth, but some people don't apreciate those things. so next time your on the computer think about that. while your on the computer wasting time there is another homeless child wandering maybe looking for their family. would you like to be that child who doesnt have a family or any type of friends? lots of people think of their life without a family but it can happen anyday. so i believe instead of wasting time on the computer we should go and interact with family and friends. even if its just having a conversation do it, maybe it can show them that you really care. in conclusion, i think that computers are a waste of time. i understand how people say it is used to comunicate with people but back then they didnt have computers and they communicated so we can to. computes make you spend less time exercising, keeps you from enjoying nature and lastly interacting with family and friends. you won't go wrong if you listen to someone who uses a computer everyday.
7 dear, newspaper people should use less time on the computer because it effects their lifestyle. instead of using their computer all the time they shoul exercise hang out with their friends and family and just enjoy nature. first of all computer's can bring a lot of obesity to the @location because it bring lazyness and it makes peole not went to exercise. if people start to exercise at least around @percent of lazyness will go down. they should at least go out for a walk instead of using all their electrity. also around @percent of your electrity bill will go down if you go exercise instead of using computer. secondly people need to start enjoying nature insteed of being on the computer at the time. people should go green and start recyling and not worrying about what somebody said on  myspace  or  facebook . also if we started recyling and worring about nature @percent of the earth would be greener. my last reson being their should be more friendler family time enstead of computer time. computers just make you break away from your family and friends because your worrying whats happening on the internet. @percent of people should just get of the computer all the time and just chill with your family and friends. in my conclusion these are my reasons being for people so they wont use the computer so much and so they can just kick back chill with your friend and family, exercise and enjoy natur
9 dear @caps @caps, i agree that computers had a positive effect on people. they teach hand-eye coordination give the ability to learn about faraway places and people and allow people to talk online with other people. more people should see computers as a positive effect on people. spending time on a computer is a great way to enhance your hand-eye coordination. it also teaches you how to type fast. typing is an important skill that you need for most jobs. it is so important that have throuhout school teaching us how to type. we also use hand-eye coordination is loaded and. you have to keep your eye on the and move your arms and hands to hit the. computers are helpful in many ways. have you ever about what looks like or what would be found on it? with a computer you can. comuputers give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people. you can get pictures some important cities and places, and some knowledge on the people who lies there. yes, you would do this in a social studies look buts is much easier and faster online. computers save time and make your life easier. computers are learning more and more advanced everyday. they give you the oppurtunity to talk with people online whether the world the street. in order to do this you need a web. they are sold in computer stores and some are already installed into the computer. being able to talk with people online is a really great thing. its a fast way to learn about that person and maybe about them if they one from a different country. its almost like a pen pal last your in a computer. people are saying that computers have a negative effect on people. they say people are spanding to much time an computer and not on exercise. they also say that they are not interacting with family and friends. all of these things should be. all you have to do is manage your time. or not all day on the computer. if you do this thinks everyone will say that computer your positive effect and are one of the last invention created. i would like to thanks all f the reader for there time and hope hat you all support me and my ideas.
10 there are many reasons that computers are a good thing for the world. they let us learn about far away places without us even having to leave our homes. another reason why computers are so important is we can talk to our family without having to even travel if they live in another country or another state or even if they are your neighbors. lastly they teach us hand-eye cordination that is a much needed skill that can help you get through life. the fantastic thing about computers are that we can learn about far away places without having to leave the comfort of our home. people of all different countries @month be inquestitive about where they came from. they @month also wonder how other countries are doing goverement wise or even economic (stocks). all of this is possible and much quicker then watching the news or weather channel. computers allow us to search the web and arm ourselves with knowledge. the marvelous things about computers is the speed of them. you could be waiting for a stock update on the news channel and wait maybe ten or even twenty minutes. however if you go on your computer and use the internet it makes you life much easier and the faster you can look up somes part of knowledge the faster you might be able to make dinner or even enjoy a nice walk outside and breathe in the nice icy crisp cold air. also radios and television stations might be a little of with their accuaracy. maybe a minute later there is a suicide bombing that you might like to know about or the stock might go up one-hundred points or go down one-hundred points. this is all valuable information that people would want to be one-hundred percent accurate. secondly you can stay in touch with your family even if they live in a different country or in a different state. with webcams that are attachable to some computers or some that are embedded within the computers you can talk to them. my grandma was in the hospital once and i wasn't allowed to see her since i was to young. since the technology of webcams were invented i was able to see her on the screen instead of seeing her in real life but at least i was able to see if she was doing okay. webcams are a could way also in discussions. such as you and your friend are joking and she says something you think is rude but you can't tell that she being sarcastic you might get into a fight. if you have a webcam you can talk to eachother on the computer and see if she is being sarcastic or not. technology @month be one of the greatest inventions that has come forth and @month be the best one that will ever be made. that last important thing that you need to know about computers is that they teach you hand-eye cordination. hand-eye cordination is an important skill that is acquired. this is an important skill because it allows you to suceed in life such as having to write. this skill is also important if you have a job that invloves computers because you need to know how to type and move you fingers fast if you want to suceed in this well payed job. this skill also helps provide a wide range of other suceesful jobs in the world. computers in the long run are magnificent machines that makes life a lot easier and fun in acquiring knowledge. if you don't have a good hand-eye cordnation you should get a computer because it will help a lot. however if you get a computer you must update it reguarly so you computer will not become slow and start crashing on you. in conclusion computers are the best thing that has been introduced to man kind so far in this world. it allows you to do do many things such as news and how the world is doing globally and how the economy is doing globally. also it allows you to stay in touch with your family no matter how far you live or what country that you life in. lastly computers teach you the important skill of hand-eye cordnation. everyone in the world should be able to have a computer so that they could obtain the knowledge that they would nedd to suceed in life.
10 it has come to my attention that there is an argument about whetehe or not computers have a positive effect on people. i think that computers do have a positive effect on people because with computers people can get needed information that could be used to help them, it lets poeple talk to friends and family around the world and also computers tecah people new things. therefore, computers have a positive efefct on people. students whether it be at college oer elementary schoools almost always go to a computer when they have to fo projects for thier classe without computers students wouldn't be able to get the information that they need and could cayse them to get a bad grade on the project which could result in grades geting worse and worse. adults use computers often for work and planning, so if there weren't any computers then it would mean thousands of people would lose their jobs and could forget sceduled plans that could be important and could result in causing families to lose money, not enough money to pay bills and could result in losing their homes causing them to live on the streets. evry person has at least two or more friends or relatives that live in a different place in the wrold that is not easy to stay in contact with so it could result in having to use long distance calling which could waste alot of money. however, with computers people can talk to freinds and realtives from around the world without having to psend any extra money on phone calls to their friends and fmaily members from around the world. also if something happens to a family member of somewhere around where a realtive lives we could use the internet to check in with them to see if everything is ok. many parents are using computers to help teach their kids at a nearly age so they are ready for when they go to school for the first time. also computers are used at schools mainly to teach the students about things that they need to know for the future, as a result computers become very usefull to people when they are trying to learn how to do something wheather its for school. college or a job computers are of tun used daily for important things that we need to learn for our lives in the future sow e won't need any extra help tyring to learn how to do something. also we would be bale to help people when they neede help if we already knew what to do. as you cna see computers do have a positive effecton peopel because people can use computers to help them gain the information they need for school or work, it lets you check in with friends and family from aorund the world and finally computers help teach us very important life lessons. in conclusion, computers have a positive effect on people and it could save a person from losing things that are.important to themselves or others. 
8 people the computer is something good and cool. why is cool? is cool because the computer help you in everything. i have reasons. the first reasons is when in your school you have homework, work, project or something like that the computer help you a lot. because in the computer you can sign in internet and you go to google or other web side. the second reason is the computer help you in your house for example: you have the big problem with your car or something like that. you can go in the computer in @location and the you see the pieces of your car. the thrid reason for the computer is so cool is because in this time you can make the everything thing. we can go the web and facilitate our life. now you can realize the work, homework, project, ideas, writting book, chat, information, print picture, and ect... and that you are architect you can make your proper work or house you see the computer is so cool. but some people use the computer for bad thing for example: for pornography or something bad this is not cool and is not appropiate for people. the computer is something fabolous and super genius. my opinion is that the computer help a lot is something like need in our life. no for live but for our life or something @caps. something you can see your family for webcam. this is fabolous but don't used the webcam for something bad you can learn thing that you don't know. i think that for this reason you used the computer for good thing. appraise the computer. please.
8 dear @caps @caps, have you ever spent more than an hour at once on the computer? computers have a negative affect on people! you could be damaging your sight, time should be spent playing outside, and it'll make it harder to talk to people in person. do your eyes tend to hurt when your finally off the computer? whether or not you playing games or typing articles your eyes @month strain to keep up with a small font on a website. i remember the time when i read an online novel and my whole body was ready to go and play. except for my eyes. instead of playing sports games on the computer you should get up and play one outside! when your on a computer, your most-likely indoors. did you knew a person should be be outside for at least @num minutes to get there vitamin @caps. your net sustaining the right amount of vitamins you need daily, at a computer screen. do you ever find it easier to talk to someone on the computer, than it is in person? your not the only person that thinks that way. if you get off of the computer and talk to one face to face you can improve your social skills. at first it wont be easy but its worth it in the long run. by now you know that computers aren't really giving off a positive effect. there hurting your vision, limiting your outdoor activity time and making it harder to talk to people in person. so come on put down the mouse down and find something  hands on  to do!
10 i remember when computer wernt so popular. back then i had to write my essays and listen to music on the radio. now computers are very popular. i believe that computers have positive effect on people @date because students need them for school, you can use them for other things, and lastly it is easy to acess them. you will know that computers are good for our society! most students use the computers to type college essays, project etc. which is good because its much easier. for example im a student that can't draw so printed some pictures of the computer so i can paste them on my post board. so in the other words the computer is useful for students. i know @num out of @num colleges expect students to turn in there assignements threw the computers or its a zero. in this society theres no time for zeros because when you are in college your still paying for the class even if your failing or not. so basically its a waste of money. so the computer can save us from failing! people these days use computers for pleasure. usually messaging people on myspace, facebook, twitter, and other social networks. which is kind of intersting because you can up with friend that you haven't seen in years. as you can see the internet has its advantaes because you would have nvever thought you will see your friend doing. another thing about computers that you can fint stuff cheaper than everyday lif say if you want to a trip and you call @organization for your ticket. the ticket came up to . but you go on the computer and you on @organization website and find your ticket to florida the price will most likely be a couple hundred dollars less. since we are in a restion we will need those couple hundred dollars for savings. computers are everywhere you can find one at school, home, a cafe or even on your cell phone. which is good because you can use them at your own convince. at home if my labtop is free i can go on it and be on it for hours playing games. also, i remember when my computer broke and i wanted to go on the computer so badly. so i realized that i can go on the computer at the library. i was so happy because it was no cost to me. to sum up computers have a positive effect on people. i seriously don't know what to do if i didn't have one because students need them, you can do other things on it, and lastly its easy to acess one! in this generation everybody is rushing and computers.
8 dear newspaper, i strongly believe that computers do not benefit society. i believe this beacause when the computer you spend less time exercising. secondly computers make time enjoying nature. finally interacting with family and friends is important when on the computer you don't do much of that. plese read on to find out what i have to say about computers. using a computer has a of down falls but @caps of which is the lack of exerizing while on the computer. as you @month know that many countrys are becoming obese because the lack of exersize. computers are no help to this problem. the only exersize computer contribute is the hand and fingers but even that is bad because if you are typing and on computer for too long you will get carpeltunlye in the fingers and hands. @person, an expert on health, said  @caps in three people go on the computer for more than @caps hour a day, which could lead to obesinty. this leads to my next paragraph. when on the computer there is no enjoying the outdoors. enjoying nature is important to every man or women's scegule. on a computer its imposible to enjoy nature because all the computer is is a time consuming brain washing thing to do. nature helps save the brain. without that then you'll be very exausted all the time. did you know @percent of kids go outside every day that means @percent of kids are in side on the computer. this leads to my finally topic. the computer @month have sites where you can talk to friends but that is no where as good as seeing them in person. your family is important so you need to spend time with them. my family always does stuff together like board games and what not. with computers there would not be any time with your family because everybody will be on the computer playing games insted of spending time with you family. in my conlusion computer have extraordinary bad affect on society because it exausts time for exersicing, also limits time to enjoy nature and finally people spent too time on computers and too little time interacting with family and friends, thank you for reading my paragraph on the many affects of computers
11 dear @location, @caps your workers wake up in the @time, they stretch their right muscles and put on their puzzy slippers. they wonder down the hailway and open their @caps book air to check the weather for today. they go on @organization, @num, and etc. to view their e-mails sent from work friends, and family. they check the time on the bootom of the laptop screen and lag onto to play some they are getting ready. society today relies heavily on computers and the net work their keeps us all connected... the incorect with technological advances happening today, people are now using computers to help with their work. but is that a some @month say that it is due to the fact the amount of spent on the computer is the much and that it stop from with friends but it does computers help with the skill of typing, help with fast end easy and helps friends and @num. of through @num @caps, @caps, etc i believe that computers have a possitive affect on people and once a great addition to society. to begin, computers help to reach @caps, children, and even adults the skill of typing. statistics show that more and more jobs on computers and hire people with a higher words per minute ability with almost @percent of adopting new computer and using computers to store information to their company, computers are necesity and so is the knowledge of understanding computers and being able to type. moreover, @caps these days are depending on computers for research to order to do projects and information i can personally connect to this because being a student on @location school, i am assigned project what involve typed words and or information. how hand it would i had to hand writs all of my work and on the for information. @caps multiple @caps are assigned the same project, the does not millon @caps to check looks out @caps there was no computer to use, what would i do? for @caps, computers and a great thing. furthermore, @caps and even adults enjoy social time, but @caps friends are family line faraway or you are not able to visit three, the computer connect in handy computer help to keep friends and family connected through @caps, @caps, @organization / or @num, i.m / @person, and webcam video chats. all of those computer related things would not there for @caps there were no computer. would you want no be disconected from family and being social is a key part of being you why shouldnt we keep them and why with all of these possitive things about computer would ever make you doubt them? in computers are wonderful things. they he is to build skill of typing, help and it easy, and also help keep and family connected. computers affect people only good ways and help everday life be easy. so, believe that computers are a great thing and that without them, even just talking to family could be jeaporadized. lets keep computers
9 wouldn't you agree that computers are needed in our life. i would, we need computer for many things, for example we need computer for communications, we also need them to educate yourself and others. next this is good for buyers and sellers. my first reason why i agree that computers benifits society is because of the communications. now in our present day with all of our new technology many people use computers to communicate with friends or family. for example if you had a loved one in the military you could use the computer to communicate with him with a webcam. computer could be a good way to talk and ask friends about homework assignments you @month have missed as if you was absent. also you could use computers to communicate with somebody selling something you @month be or, you could get more detail about that product by talking to the owner of it through maybe email. my second reason would be education. now a days many college students with work going on @month not have time to attend schools so with the help of a computer they can take online classes. for some students instead of study in classroom all day they could be learning from computers and it could be more to the students so maybe they would understand topics better. like science for example when doing a lab you could research and do it on a computer. with computers students could learn more because they would have textbooks or maybe nothing and if they were interested in a topic they could research it and educate themselves. my third reason would be buying and selling products. many people all over the world go on the internet to buy or sell products. like ebay that is a website many people items on to make money and other people can buy them. so computers could be a good solution to making money and to also saving gas because people can order products online and have them shipped to there house instead of driving @caps from the i have told you like communications, education, and buying and selling products i hope you agree with me that computers do benifit society
8 the computer is able to do so many things. it think computers have posotive effects on people. but some experts believe they don t which is why i'm writing this paper so that i can explain the positions from both sides. did you know most everyone who his a house their chances of having a computer is just as lucky as having a telephone. computers believe it they help us in life wether @caps to keep information, talk online, find a good recipe or what ever it is @caps there. that is why computers are so positive. it we did not have computers there would not be any technological advances that we have @date, @caps one of the most important devices. let me share my expierence okay. i had a job interview right well i could not find that street so i went on my computer and it gave me the directions i made it to my interview. thats why i think computers have posotive effects. now the opposite side says people are spending too much time on their computer and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with fiends and family. well i have some people spend to much time on their computer @caps completely choice. and those are people who usually don't have alot of self control. and exercising who said that everyone need exercise in the persons already skinny what does need to exercise. for the interacting with friends and family you can do that i mean how long can a person look at a computer screen. so in conclusion you can see that computers are good but with self control they can be enjoyed with no bad side effects. so next time on the computer enjoy it but remember your friends, family and your health is more important.
12 dear @caps @caps, @caps, walking into a room seeing people interacting with their computer screen i earning new and exciting, information they can everyday. the question is what effects do computers have on people? i certainly think computers have a positive effect on people. they teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and peapre, and even allow people to talk online with others. computers can definetly have a positive on soriety. computers have tought a very valueable to every user; hand-eye coordination! whetver it's clicking a link to a site that you found on @organization, or playing the matching same of bejeweled, you are learing hand-eye coordination. a cording to recent studies, over @percent of people interviewed said they had excellent hand-eye coordination and @percent said it was on the computer. sure we all need to get exercise outside, but the computer can be helpful as long as we don't let it overwelm us. smart people would agree that coordination is a very helpful skill. these brilliant inventions also helps us learn a bout different places and people. picture this scenario if you will; a student at @organization has to do a project on the @caps @caps in the @location. he goes to the library to check out the encyclopedias but... they are out of date. he then goes to the computer lab and finds it on @organization like that! this scenario shows that the computer is one of the fastect ways to get information on any subject or topic. certainly text sources can give the same accurate information, but the computer is fast and easy. when you need information on the line. but why stop there? not only can you get information on certain people and places on these machines, you can also learn what's the newest fads, what's carrently happening in @location, and the latest @caps gossip. the computer is definetly a easy sources for information on different areas and people. this amazing device can also let you talk to people online! there are many ways to do this. you can use the old-fashioned @caps-mail, you can use a device in the @caps called someone. you of course need a @caps to do thank one. i remenber a time when i was bored so i decided to do my homework. the problem was i forgot what it was! i quickly grabbed the phone and called my class mate but he didn't answer. i then sprinted to my computer and to see if he was online. sure enough he was! i got the home work and got an a all thanks to the computers ability to interact with others.
9 dear the @organization @month say that people are spending too much time foucusing on the computer and not on their homework, or getting some fresh air outside. i say those people are @caps! computers are a giant step into new technology. for example, you can use the computer to do research for school, communicate with friends online and give children some down time where they can learn about far away places and people. if you were doing a research paper for school and you have checked out all the books on the subject of your paper, but you suddenly relized that you forgot one of the most important books! you race back to the library only to find out that it is closed. computers then come in handy. you can google the book and find an online copy of the book, so you make the grade on that paper. also, possibly you are having trouble with math homework and you are home alone, what do you do then? that is what computers are there for! so you can easily go to your teachers website and there would be the explanation on how to do that specific lesson. children @caps to commonicate with their friends, to some extent. such as a homework question or just to talk for fun. without friends children would be knowhere. statistics show that @percent of all children who are permitted to talk with friends, out of school stay off of drugs and promote a stronger education and grades. the internet was not just created for the heck of it. it was invented so people can communicate, childeren can do reaserch, and for fun and exploring as well. for example - learning about far away places, people, and culture, exploring animals, and even online shopping is now availble. these are necessities for all people to have access to. without computers @caps would not know the important news when @caps needed to or information needed for a specific moment. computers are the future (yes i am repertative) @caps @caps to have computers in our lives for communication, shopping, learning purposes, teaching, research on places, animals, people, and culture. also for email purposes and to get important news around to everyone applicable to it. this is why @caps @caps to continue forward with computers, and technology for the future. so all the people of @location keep your computers, they are an important stepping stone needed for growth and moving onto the future of technology. plus who would not want a good computer game once and a while.
8 dear local newspaper, @caps about what the world would be like without computers. scary thought? i had the same reaction. a world without computers is a world of non-communicating people and no where to gather information independently. the benefits of having computers are that they are a way of communicating with friends and family that don't live in your area or that you just haven't talked to in a while. they also teach hand-eye coordination which is good for almost anything. lastly, they give people the ability to learn about other things in the world. in conclusion, computers have outstanding effects on people. first of all, in my perspective, having a computer, allows me to communicate to people i've met on past vacations. i can email, them and talk to them on social networks such as facebook. this is benefical to anyone that has lost touch with friends or even family. being able to talk to friends i haven't spoken to in a white, gives me and others the opportunity to catch up and reconnect. in conclusion, being able to communicate with others on a computer, is only i, of the many benefits a computer has! second of all, not only does having a computer allow you to talk to others but it can teach you hand-eye coordination as well. dereck was a channel @num news reporter,  i can hit some far balls that take the cake for some of our games. i truely @caps it's because my mother teached me now to use a computer!  @caps especially benefit from computers because they teach them hand-eye coordination which is great for those homeruns, or even touchdowns! third of all computers allow students and many others to learn and look up things they don't know. @percent of schools around the country benefit from having school computers for research. on the other hand, businessman, parents, and even teachers use the internet to learn about things around the world and to gather information to teach their classes. overall, computers have many benefits such as they allow you to communicate with others, they teach you hand-eye coordination, and even allow you to learn about things and places around the world. as a whole, this intelligent invention of the computer is an incredible machine that seems to have all the answers and a success for realiable information!
9 dear @organization, @caps you know that @num in every @num @caps families own a computer? computers can be helpful if you need to write an essay for school, but when it comes to family vs. computer the average kid will usually pick the computer. computers are taking away family time, exercise privledges, and time spent on school on school work.  @person, get off the computer and come play '@caps' with us!  @caps mom's will say this to childeren at least once as week, the answer that is @caps common is  @caps!  @caps childeren from the ages of @num to @num would rather spend time on the computer weather it's playing games or talking with friends. this is on issue that needs attention. families should start to spend more time together instead of hanging out in front of a screen. my friend @person has a little brother that is always playing games on the computer. whenever @person wants to play hide and go seek with him he always finds a way out of playing with @person play computer. aport from spending time with family computers take away @caps kids exercise privlidges. one example is that last week it snowed and i wanted my neigbor @person to come outside and have a snowball fight with me but, she said had to finish a level on a computer game and it was realy important. this proves that it takes away time outside alone with exercise. a walk in the park with friends sounds relaxing to @caps people except for @caps teenagers would rather talk to their friends using a computer instead of actualy spending time with them. lastly if time is being spent staring at a screen. when does homework got done? i took a survey recently among the eighth grade and the results showed that @percent of the people that don't do their homework are due to spending too much time on the computer. in my science class a boy named @caps never does his homework. i asked him why one day and he says it was because he was talking to his girlfriend who also never does her homework because she always has something to do on the computer. @caps time spent with family, @caps exercise getting done, @caps time to play outside, and missing homework assignment are alot to sacrifice for  @caps one more level.  i you want to help me get childeren not spend so much time on computer, write on artical on this important issue in one of your newspaper and please consider my ideas.
9 dear @caps @caps i believe that there is more and more controvosy about computer and whether they benefit society or not. in my opinion, computers are a wonderful resource that will soon become a household item. i am writing to persuade you that computers have a positive effect on people. i believe computers are a good thing because they allow people access to more knowledge, they allow people to stay in contact with people they dont see very often, and they allow people to keep up and know whats going on in modern life. one reason computers are useful is that they allow people to stay in contact with people they don't see very often. today, parents don't mind sending their children off to college as much because they can actually see them using video chat websites like @organization. this feature on computers has a big impact on the life of people today. people in @location can talk with people in @location. this type of often allows for people to share new and inventive things they've discovered. another reason computers can be useful is because they help people keep in touch with modern life. many companies are now erasing newspaper ads and putting them all on computer websites. some companies are only selling items on their websites and shipping them to the buyers. with computers students can also get their homework done and send it to their teacher by email if they cannot make it to school that day. there is even at home colleges now where you take your class online. i believe that in a few years from now more and more people will do business with computers and more stores will sell online only. finally the last reason i believe computers are a good idea is that they allow people access to more knowledge with the internet. there are websites soldy devoted to history and information on many things. also there are blogging websites where people can debate on information or get questions answired by real people who @month know a lot about the topic. another thing on computers that helps you get informed is websites like wikipedia where people can search a topic, read history about it, and follow links to other websites if they want to pick apart the topic even more. overall, i believe that computers area a great resource to human kind and will be used for more and more things in a few years. i believe computers are useful because they allow people access to more knowledge, the ability to keep in touch with others, and to keep in touch with modern life. i believe that in a couple years there will be liss stores on the streets and most will be online because it is much cheaper for the companies. so, most people in a couple years will be computers and use them effectively.
8 i agree with the computers helping people. to start with, computers have a possitive affect on us. they also give us the ability to learn. also it allows people to talk online from far away places. so, yes, computers are good for people. first of all, computers do have a possitive affect. the computer @month give some one motivation. or it will help someone find their lost pet. also it could help you get a job. plus you can find a safe home with it. so, ya computers do have a possitive effect. you can also gain the ability to learn. this is by helping deth people with sites on sighn language. also you can get information on places you will visit. this will help learn about diffrent contrays. most importantly it will help kids an adults on school work or work. this concluds that you can learn things on the computers. the computer also allows you to talk with people far away. this will come in handy for familys. also people who have hospitilized family. plus fathers or moms in the military can talk with their kids. most of all though is adopted kids could talk to their birth parents online. here is another reason why computers are good. this is why i agree with computers. they have a possitive affect on people. they given us ability to learn! lastly it allows you to talk to people you love that are far away. so, in conclution, it is a benifit for people to use the computers!
10 dear local newspaper, @caps on a beautiful sunny day, people inside on their computers instead of enjoying the weather. this is what could happen if people are using them. i believe that computers have a bad effect on people because their communication skills will drop, people won't get enough exercise & their health can be imnarred. as i mentioned, everyone who is using a computer on a daily basis, will drop their communication skills.. people enter chat rooms not knowing who they are talking to. for example, if i logged onto & chat room, someone might ask for personal information such as where you live, your phone number & your name. this could lead to things such as kidnaping & even rape. also, interactions with family members & friends @month decrease. you can be playing a computer game, online, or going on youtube to watch random videos of people. you tube in said to be a dangerous site for younger children. kids could go under history to go to a website they were recently on when click the wrong one bringing them inapropiate website. finally, teenagers and adults go onto facebook & twitter. some @month say these sites @month change the social interactions, but it really isn't. kids & adults are constantly getting addicted to it. also telling people what you are doing every moments of your day everyday is kind of unreal. people don't need to know when you do things in your day i have keep up this our communication skills are sure to decrease. secondly, exersice is a problem. doctors say that @percent of their parents are obeise or over weight according to @organization. kid just sit at home & play computer games such as sims @num & video chat with their friends instead of hanging out with them. no one really goes for walks any more either. also, people don't go out & enjoy nature like the you. @person, a state @location from @location in @location said,  each year the number of people are getting fewer & fewer. preety soon all parks are going to have to get closed down.  @caps don't want this to happen, do you? i know i would not. our generations are just becoming more technology enhanced. finally, more & more people are becomeing unhealthy. a person's eye sight is most likely to drop if they are on the computer everyday. my aunt is required to use her computer everyday at work. she went to her eye doctor because her vision was become weaker. one of the first questions he aske was, do you use a computer on a daily basis? she answered yes. he said she would need cataraks eye surgery. this was all in result of using a computer. finally, you could get althritis in your hands & fingers from typing & using the mouse all the time. many people at the age of fourty are probaly going to need hand surgeries from all the work the do, likes! as you can see technology is harming your communication skills, exersice & you health. i bet you don't want your future generations like this. so take a part & contact your local newspaper today.
5 dear newspaper, i think that computers have a lot of effect on people @caps their not getting the exercis they need coz there just exercising there fingers. and while there at the computer there not looking at nothing else but the screen and thats not good for anyones health if there just looking at a computer screen the hole time. another reason why i think at affects people @caps there not eatin wat they need to eat there just eatin something quick like junck food so they could on the computer. all are this effect stay on the @caps people either go places or have atheres might not be going out time their effects need to
5 how @caps you feel if your favorite book was taken off the shelves of your school or public library? i, along with many other students, @caps find this discouraging and distastrous, so i do not believe that censorship should affect books that are on the shelves. otherwise, a demolished love of reading, crushed individuality, and separated population @month be born.     like the beloved @person @person series by @person, many books and series are being taken out of libraries' collections due to people in society finding them offensive. in this case, the world of witchcraft in which this story blooms is against some religious beliefs; therefore, some individuals within a religion campaign to have these books banned. fortunately, none of the libraries i visit, with their eclectic collections, had banned this series, or i @caps not have the strong thirst for literature as i do now. all books have the potential to pull a student into the wonderful world of reading, like @person did for me, so taking away books that are most likely to spark an interest or start a firework of creativity @caps not only affect this generation, but the futures of all.          if this censorhip was to be allowed, who is to say what all  could be censored? who @caps be the final judge as to what books @caps be banned? it @caps all come down to power and who was willing enough to take it. this struggle to be on top has the possibility of seperating people apart like political parties. disagreements could turn into debates, and those could turn into fights. it can be concluded that people are stubborn for their beliefs, and to have someone choose what everyone is allowed to believe @caps  be wrong. for instance, it @caps be like an @caps forcing a @caps to not believe in @caps; a vegetarian commanding that meat can no longer be eaten; a woman taking away men's voting rights. censorship @caps lead to the disrespect of other's opinions, and disrespect is never a beneficial thing.     each and every person has a different opinion on what is offensive or not, so to censor books @caps be to censor all individual mentality. without each person's unique thoughts and beliefs, the world @caps become similiarly vapid and dull. differences in beliefs is what adds variety to the population and what makes a person special; additionally, free thought is a right all people should have. if someone was to limit the mental, literary stimulants that are out in the world, the amount of creativity and individuality @caps decrease.     to conclude, censorship @caps be a disrespect to individuality, personal beliefs, and the overall joy of reading a good book. just because one might not believe in what a story says, it does not mean that the piece of literature should be forbidden. no one is being forced to read the books that grace the hundreds of shelves in a library, so if someone is offended, simply do not read it. so how @caps you feel if your favorite book was gone from all libraries? disrespected? that is how i @caps feel
3 personally i don't think libraries, movie stores, etc., should be selling any of the items just mentioned. if they are found offensive to the public. i think it offends lots of people. citizens such as senior citizens and children shouldn't have to be exposed to inaproppriate material. i think in order to buy or rent certain books, music, movies, or magazines you should have to be at least eight-teen years of age. the economy is bad enough the way it is. there is a new generation of people who are being raised at the moment, and they should't have to look back at their childhood and have memories of seeing offensive movies, or reading offensive books and magazines.      i think music is what influences a person the most. if they are constantly listening to foul language and what not, that is going to just stay into a persons mind. i know this from experience. i also believe that movies influence a peron lot too. for example, a kid goes to see a movie that has a lot of violence in it. well after he is done watching the movie he thinks to himself, 'well it must be okay to kill someone because i saw someone kill another person because they got away with it and never got into trouble.' that is just one example of how the humans mind can change.     in conclusion i do believe that humans have the right to read, watch, or listen to what they want. i just think that people should have to be a certain age for some of the things though. also, i think that anything citizens find offending should be hidden in some sort of area in a store or library. so that  just people who want a certain item or whatever can get it with out other people having to see or listen to anything offending
2 i think if people find books offensive they should not even read that book to begin with. if books are found offensive and taken from shelves then book shelves would be emtpy. then their would nothing left for people to read.     some of the greatest authors use offensive words in their books take them off th shelves and you will be getting rid of the greatest material. @person @caps for example in the book '@caps' its offensive to gays and one gets killed.
3 i don't believe that certain books, music, magzines, or movies should be removed. if they are found offensive then that is not my problem. if they offend me then oh well that is my issue to deal with. when it comes to any of the mentioned items, sooner or later society will find them again and they will be back on the shelves.     no matter how offensive they are curiosity will bring them back on the shelves. if a book id found offensive by one person or group of people that doesnt mean it should be removed off of the shelves. that is a problem that the one person or group of people will have to live with.      anything and everything is educational in it's own way. even if it is offensive it can teach someone wrong from right. that being said is it wrong or right for someone to want something offensive to removed from the shelves? it depends on a persons personal views or beliefs. whether they like it or not things are offensive to somebody out there and there is nothing we can do out there to change that.     it's sad to admit, but there really isn't anything to change that. it's just easier to live with it. maybe whatever you found offensive wasn't meant to be offensive. it depends on what you take offence to. maybe the writer, director, or composer meant for something to be offensive, maybe they didn't. it's all based on how you take what they said into thought. so when it boils down to it nothing should be removed from the shelves. for if one thing must be removed then youi might as well remove everything.
4 i absolutely do not think that any book, movie, magazine, music, etc., should be removed from the shelf because they find it offensive.  if we do that, then all the books would be off the shelf.  sometimes the really good books are when they are offensive, because they are actually telling you what they really believe in.     i remember when i was twelve, the news was saying that a school was taking books off the shelf because it offended one person in the school.  the shocking part was that almost the whole school was reading that book.  even teachers were reading it.  the school board did not even care though.  i think that was completely handled the wrong way.  they should have talked to the girl and said it was unfair to ask that when everybody reads it.  if it offended her, then she should not read it.     music is an outlet for many people.  they can express their feelings in a way that is amazing.  without music, there would not be any fun in the world.  people are alwasy listening to music.  when they are sad, mad, upset, confused, etc.  if people think some kind of music is offensive, then they should not listen to it.     movies are going to be offensive to at least one thing all the time.  that is what makes a movie: a hero and a vilian.  we want to good guys to win.  the movie makes fun of the bad guys.  somebody is always going to get hurt.     when i read, watch, or listen to something, i do not think of how offensive it is to me or somebody else.  i think of how the artist feels.  why they wrote it that certain way.  if i am listening to music, i listen to the beat and the words at first.  then if i like it, i start singing it.  if i do not like it, then i just change the song.     i hope people do not end up just taking things off the shelf when someone is offended.  we need the different opinions in life.  if we all had the same opinions, we would not be ourselves in anyway.  i do not want to be the same as everybody else.  i love my personality.  i am different and kind of an outcast.  but i am true to myself.  and i respect other people's opinions.  i wish everyone would do the same.  or at least try to do the same.  thank you for listening to what i had to say
4 a book represents a person's beliefs and feelngs about a topic. therefore censoring books is wrong because it goes against freedom of speech. i do not believe books, or other media should be removed because while it @month be offensive, if it is the truth about something then we need to read about it to prevent tragedies from happening again. a person who finds a topic offensive isn't forced to read about it. if we do not accept other people beliefs, we are just as prejudice as the books we are trying to censor.      many books that are threatened by censorship are books about historical facts, such as the holocaust. i think we have the right to know about important events. for one reason, if we forget about such things, than they are more likely to be repeated. do we really want the murder of millions of people to be repeated? just becaused we are ashamed of something dosen't mean we should sweep it under the carpet where it can lay hidden waiting to stike again like a hungry alligator. instead books about prejudice events should be kept out to show an example of how we shouldn't act.     while some books are censored because of shame, some are censored because a certain group of people @month find it offensive. there is a much easier solution that censoring those books. the offended groups should just ignore the book. if it is offensive in the first place then no one should be forced to read it. the book shouldn't be forced in any other way like posters, and television broadcast. it should be kept in a certain section of a library so parties wishing to avoid it can.     the main reason for a book to be censored in the first place is because someone finds in offensive. however, isn't keeping someone from saying something just as offensive? to @caps a @caps is a big target for censorship, but it is about treating everyone fairly. if that book like that was censored, it would be like saying some people are better than others. another big target for censorship in some countries is the @caps. censoring that book would basically tell the @caps population that they are wrong.     censoring something is wrong. not only could it cause sad events to repeat themselves, offended parties can just simply avoid the book. while some books offend people, censoring a book can be just as offensive to other parties. the simplest thing to do is to leave it up to the reader to decid if they should read it, or not.
4 in this millenium we really should'nt be to concerned about censorhip. people say so way worse in puplic and do worse things in public. on the other side of this, the parents of a child should be watching their kid and looking to see what they are about to grab off the shelf. its the parents fault if their child gets ahold of a book that has adult content on or in it. so why should we have censorship?                                                                             if a cd contains adult content and the child is underage and grabs it off the shelf listening to it, then its the parents fault for not being responsible enough to watch their child. same goes for books and etc.. now if the child is old enough to understand what they grab then they should be able to listen to it, and ask questions about it. if its about adult relationships and the child takes it, then the parent should explain it all and tell them what is going on. the parent should be the one to take responsibility.                           now, if a book, music, movie, magazine, and ect.contain raceism in it then it should be censored, unless its about history. kids under the age of teen usally repeat what they hear or read. same goes for teenagers too actualy! books with the wrong kind of words in it should be kept safe or there should be a age to where you can get it. the world has enough horrid language in it, why should the library add to it by letting kids get ahold of these books and repeating what they hear.                  i remember when i was walking around a library and i saw a little kid not older than @num grab an adult book and started to open it and look through it. the parent was no where to be seen nor heard, who leaves their child in a book section like that? this young boy put the book down on the hard floor and started to take off his clothes. this was no ones fault, wasnt the library, wasnt mine. people should take responsibility, control their kids and if they can't then leave them at home!                                                        there are also certain people who need book for research and need to take home books for their projects. we should'nt have censorship and take down all the books that should be contained from kids. some of us need those kind of books in order for us to do our research and projects!      no we should'nt have censorship in our libraries! im not about to be able to miss a project or miss a good movie because some parents don't know how to control their kids and watch what they grab. we should be able to keep all the books, movies, magazines, and ect., there could be a way to censor most books but they would need their own shelf, and they could be a age lemit or a pass people could use. that would take to long to do so though. so keep our libraries filled with interesting things without censoring them!
3 wow thats racist. as i said when i saw the movi white men cant jump. yes that movie could have afended me a lot but it didnt personaly i thought it was funny i enjoyed it cuase its true statistics say black people can jump higher then white people. its all on how you look at it you have to have a sense of humor when it comes to stuff like that.      everyone remembers sometime when someone said something offensive to them. but its your choice to take that to heart or just laugh about it. life is so much easyer when u dont cry over every little thing that someone said to you. see now i have a since of humor. when i was in that movie i was laughing so hard i almost peed myself. i didnt care that it singled out white people so what its funny.     to kill a mochinburd was also a book that a lot of people called offensive and i can see why. it had the @caps word in there a lot. but back then it was a different time the people in the book werent saying it to you so why would you be offended by it. he wasnt offending you.      if you take little things like that to your heart then you will have a tough time going through life. somethings you just have to let go and roll off your body.     in conclusion yes we have had a lot of offending stuff said to us but you cant let it get you down so much you have to move on. and if you move on you will be a better person in the long run.
3 every library has tons of information on just about everything.  there are tons of books, music, movies, magazines and more that contain this information.  there is even some information that some people might take offence to.  on the other hand, somebody else could be perfectly fine with it.  i think that all libraries should keep all their books on the shelfs, no matter what kind of content they contain, because not everybody takes offence to some contents in books, and it is the same way vice versa.     the subject race might come into play in some books in libraries.  books have information about people doing things to other people just because of their race.  some people want books took out of their libraries because of the content that they contain, but really it could be a n important part of history that people need to be educated about.  some books have words that are very offencive to people because of their skin color, relgion, or ethnic race.  this information that people need to know because thats how people were treated back then and some stuff like that still occurs today.     libraries have all kinds of information.  i think that all the books at libraries should stay there no matter what they contain.  even if some content is offensive some people it could still be a important part of history that people need to know
2 many pepole think that offensive material should be removed from the libary because children could pick then up and look in them. i do not belive this should be done.     they already have a childrens section if a child looks in a inappropiate book outside of the childrens section then its thier fault. i do not think it should inconvience someone to have to go elsewhere to get that cd,game,book, or movie they were looking for. it is very hard to come across a inapropiate book without looking for it on purpose. it could be a book used for teaching health or nursing class and is not meant to be inapropiate at all.          these are a few things you should consider when choosing a side on this debate. who knows we might have to vote on it someday
3 i do not think that they should be taken off of the shelf because some people find it offensive. the way i look at it is, is that everyone has their own beliefs and rights their own opinions. not everyone is going to think alike.     as an example some people are against blacks and others are not. everyone thinks different and have their own opinions therefore, they should all be able to listen to whatever.      not everyone is going to like what you like and listen and believe everything you do. don't read it if it offends you, but just cause it offends you doens't mean that someone else out there doesn't believe in it or likes it.
3 all throughout the world there are libraries.  librairies have all different kinds of materiel stacked upon shelves.  most of the material is helpful and enjoyable but some is not.  i think libraries should be able to have whatever they want on their shelves.  yes, i understand some of this material @month be inappropriate for a certain person but there is a way you can fix this.     if libraries have inappropriate books, movies, music, ect.  i think they should be able to keep them.  just because some people do not that material does not mean everyone won't like it.  everyone has their own style, everyone likes different things and has different opinions.  isn't that what makes the world go around?       adults @month have a problem with the offensive material because they have children who go to the library.  i understand there concern but there can be a way to stop them from getting to the inappropriate material.  if libraries are going to have this kind of stuff in their libraries i think there should be a blocked off room where kids can't go.  that way the people who like that kind of stuff can still get to it but the children can not.       we go to school for a vast amount of reasons.  some being; to learn, to get us ready for college, and to be independent.  while we are at school not only are we learing things like math and evolution, but we are also learing whats going on in the world around us.  if you haven't noticed, all that is out there anymore is bullying, cursing songs and horrifying movies.  we, as children and teenagers see and hear about this everyday.  since we learn and already know about all of this 'offensive' stuff, why not have it in our libraries for other people who want to study it?     there is alot of different kinds of material in libraries.  some good for kids and teenagers and some inappropriate.  i understand the concern for parents on censorship in public libraries, but there is a way to stop it.  i think as long as its blocked off into a different room, everyone will be fine and it will cause no harm
4 if you walk into a store and see a book you dont like or a magazine you could care less for, should you be able to get rid of it? my answer to that is no you should not. you do not own the libraries books and you do not have any say on what is displayed in any store. you are the viewers and buyers to these suppliers and if you dont like it dont buy it or look.     when i was in the eighth grade i went to @location for a church missions trip. there was alot of cool things there that i saw. this was one of the most popular places in the @location. when we wouldn't be working or serving others we would walk around and do some shopping. there is alot of people in this city and it was packed all the time. now with that being said there was alot of different stores and there are some in my opinion at the time that i thought were very inappropiate for my age level. my whole group walked into a store where we just really didnt belong and we all had no clue this was the kind of store this was. our actions simply invovled nodding our heads good bye at the cashier and walking out continuing our day of shopping. we did not remove any books, pictures, or even magazines in that store. reason being is that, that was their store and we had no right to remove anything. after we left there other people walked in that store and liked what they saw if we would have removed those items they wouldnt of got to see what they liked. that would be like someone removing something from a store i like meaning i'd never get to see it and i wouldn't want that.     if you walk in to a store and see something you do not like you shouldn't be able to try and get rid of that object. whether you want your kids seeing it or not you just cant do it. you take your own risk walking into a store and seeing what they have in store for you.you are there to browse around or buy a few things if you would like too. every store should have their own certain things and what you find offensive other people might like. that goes for the opposite too what other people find offensive you might like. it is all a big chain with many loops.      so say you do take that piece of material off that shelf or off the display. now that material is gone all because of you thought it was offensive. say another person walks in the ame store and takes something off the shelve that they thought was offensive. now there is two things gone from the shelve, but you actually liked what they took off the shelve and your upset that they took that off. this will cause alot of conflict and big situations in the future if this was allowed. one person likes it one person doesnt. if you dont like what you see in a store then you shouldn't walk in or you should simply ignore the stuff that is offensive to you.     these are some of my opinions about this catagory. i believe you shouldn't be able to take stuff off shelves and terminate other stores products. always be aware of what your getting your self into and know the outcome of the decisions you make. this could cause alot of lossed jobs and many conflicts between shoppers and viewers like you. i hope you take this into consideration and understand my reasonings for what i have said
4 have you been to a library and saw no books or magazines on the shelfs? well if the libraries try taking away all the books and magazines that are offensive then there wouldn't be anything there to read. if you pick up a book or magazine and you think it offends you then don't read it, grab a knew one. through out this article you will hear about how movies can be offensive, and how libraires shouldn't empty their shelves over it, then my belief against this topic.     movies, books, magazines and music can be offensive. if you think about it though if you get offended then don't read or listen or watch it. you just simply have to grab a new book. now the question comes, what if its the best book or movie up there? if thats the case then watch it but just know its your own choice to. if you really want to get those books, movies, etc., off those shelves then grab one that just really offends you and take it to the manager and ask him/her to read it or you read a part to them. if he/she don't she a problem with it tell him/her to read from your perspective and then think about it. after you get done with that ask him/her wants a stack of the books, etc., that offend you. thats when you start piling up the stacks right in front of him/her.     the libraries on the other hand if your getting bombarded with people coming in and sayin this books offends me i can't belive this on your shelves, what if a little kid got ahold of this.......!  managers or owners if you get people coming in to tell you to read this book, watch this movie. what do you do? in my opinion i'd read or watch maybe the first two or three but after that i'd start playin it off and just agreeing to get them out of your office. now you gotta think, man if all these people keep coming in here and saying these books, movies, etc. are offensive then you really got to take action. if you take books away from the libraries then you loose sales. i've been to a lbrary where everything was catagorized so people know what there looking through before they start reading which is what i think all libraries should do instead of just putting them out on the shelves.     my belief on the topic is that you go into a lbrary knowing whats in a lbrary, books! now if you go in there and theres a book or movie that alot of people complained about then i'd see them making an effort to get rid of it. but if your the only one then i highly doubt they will make a special effort to get rid of it. you also got to think the author of the book didn't write it just to offend you, their not singling you out.if its that bad where you can't read or watch it without something setting you off then take it back ang grab a new one. if that book or movie is their best seller they're not going to destroy it because of one single person. so if you go to a library and check out a book or movie without knowing whats it about then i wouldn't blame them for not doing anything about it, its your choice not theirs.     this article took alot of diffrent sides which is good in a way because its not just about one single topic. however if you keep nagging on the manager to get that book or movie out of there and they still don't do it then go to a different library. maybe that library wont have as many books, movies, magazines, etc., to get offended about and if there is maybe they will be cool about the situation and try fixing the problem to benefit the two of you. so if you read this article and get offended by it then sorry, just expressing personal opinion and trying to get you to solve your problems. thanks for reading
3 do you believe that certain things need to be taken off the shelf that's uncensored for my children to see.no, i honestly do not because the library shouldn't have no uncensored things put up on the shelves that our children might not see.cause the staff shouldn't let the children in that area without a parent were the uncensored books, magazines, movies, music and etc.      but it's know ones fault because the media staff that works in the library shoudn't allow the younger kids to go in that area were those things are unless their guardian are with them. unless they allow them in the area were the books, movies, magazines, etc.the kids should have a certain part of the library were they can take books from that's inappropiate for them.     there's alot of books that children shouldn't be able to read but they read anyways without adults permission.and yes their some books,that's not inappropiate for the little ones and the big kids.thing's like that is offensive toward the parents how the staff just let them read in see things like that in the parents wonder why, an how there children learning things like that.     certain things should be posted for things that kids shouldn't be able to see an read and do.and yes i have the right to say something to the staff for letting my child read, see things their not suppose to see.they know those things not appropiate for them so why would they let them watch or do or see stuff like that.     my conclusion yes i think certain things that don't suppose to be were they suppose to be for young children to see.that's not right to let them see things like that. so that's why i'm writing this essay to the newspaper arguing on whats right for allowing them to see uncensored things they are not to see
3 i strongly disagree.i think that materials should don't  be removed from the library.@caps all the materials are part of the library and for the school and for us too.all the materials, such as books, music, movies, and magazines, cd's. should don't be removed from the library.i got my own reasons that materials should don't be remove from the shelf. like sometimes i don't found any interesting things to do, so i go to my tiny library that i got in my house and i pick any book that i like.but when i don't like or i don't find any interesting book in my house, i go to the library to find  some intresting  books.but when the libraries or the school got offensive books, magazines, movies, ect., i think that offensive stuff shoul be remove from the library,@caps is not good for the children's, like when they want to read a book, like cartoon or animal book, and they don't find what they want they are going to get mad. and what about the parents the parents if they need to found some information about a book, or they just wanted to read and they found offensive stuff, the parents are going to get mad, not all the parents right but some parent will.and they maybe are not going to came back again.i never experience something like this in my life @caps in my school and the library that i go they don't have anything offensive or inapropiated. that's why a respect the people for the library and for the school, @caps they respec us too. tha's why i never go to places that i don't know.supose i go to a library that i don't know and i bring my parent and my little brother right and this library have offensive materials, my parents are going to get mad with me, they are going to said that if i don't have respec, and that i bring my brother to a innapropiated place they are going to be mad with me, that i bring my family to a offensive place, and is not my foul right.and those are my opinions why
4 real life is rated @caps so why pretend it's not? if a library feels that if a book is too graphic, a movie too violent or that music to agressive then its their own choice to remove it or not. it is true that that it's pointless to try and censor the lives of kids and teenagers.explicit content is all around not only in the media and literature. the never ending game of shielding this generations teenagers and children is already finished.     in this point in time, the main focus of alot of movies and music and books is something violent, agressive, inapproiate, or explicit. the idea of removing these things from library shelves is pointless. the will always be violence and crime in todays world along with excessive swares and cuss words all around. it's exceptable that some parents don't want their children reading,watching or listening to something they don't or wouldn't approve of but even if the kids are protected and home out in the world sometimes the parents wont be there.     libraries are public places, and a percent of the audience would be upset, frusterated or angr if the books, music or movies they liked were no longer avalable due to the cencorship. it @month seem as if viewing, reading or listening to something violent or explicit, would have an effect on the listener. on the streets, at school, at the park and more places children and teens will be exposed to this type or explicit language so attempting to cencor it in their reading and viewing matterial is just pointless.        in my experence i have grown up and been around people who have grown up listening to violent music, watching graphic movies and more explicit material and not been effected. i saw my first rated @caps movie when i was nine, so parents can give thier kids somewhat of an age but at one point trying to cencor anything is a waste of time. with schools now teaching their students the positives of being abstinent and the sexual deseases, students are more likely to refrain despite what they see in movies, read about, or listen to. any child exposed to the internet could be subject to all kinds of inapproite material, explicit canotent, bad language, cuss words, and disturbing images.     real life is rated @caps so why pretend it's not? trying to block the explicity and violence in the world is an endless battle. certain things @month go over the line, but others are just renactments and previews of whats really going on in this world.why would you hinder the real world away from children and teenagers? movies have a rating and music @caps have an explicit content label so people should know whats approiate for themselves. the first sware word a child hears probably wasnt in a song or movie and was probably somewhere in the real world.
4 in libraries, there should not be censorship on materials considering that it's an individual's decision to read what they prefer. there is no appropriate standard on what makes a book offensive to a group, so it should be undetermined as to what makes a book offensive.      in a public library, many children, who the books are censored for, are with their parents. parents should make an independent choice on what they can allow their children to read. letting society ban a book simply for the use of inappropriate materials is ridiculous. if an author spent time creating a story, it should be appreciated, and should not put on a list of no-nos. if a certain person doesn't like a book's reputation, all they have to do is not read it. even in school systems, librarians are there to guide kids to read good books. if a child wants to read an inappropriate book, the librarian will most likely discourage him or her not to read it.     in my experience, i wanted to read a book that my mother suggested to me, but as i went to the school library it turned out to be a censored book. some parents believe children should be ignorant about offensive things written in books, but honestly many of the same ideas are exploited to them everyday on television and internet. so trying to shield your child from the bad things @month be a great thing, but the efforts are usually failed attempts. it also never occurs to the people censoring the books, that some people can't afford to buy the books they want to read. the libraries, for some, are the main means for getting books.     to conclude there is very little reason to ban a book from the shelves. many of the books banned have important lessons that can be obtained through reading it. if a person doesn't like a book, the simplest thing to do is not to pick it up.
4 censorship in libraries is not necassary. no reading material should be taken off the shelf. every book has a different experience that can help a child learn. if the gurdain of a child believes that a certain book is bad or offensive; then the gurdian can forbid the child to read it. if people began to take away options on reading materials some kids @month refuse to read at all. every person is different and likes an option to pick a book that they can get in to. censoring books at a library is pointless, you take away options, and the experience to learn from certain books.     every book has a different plot and a different moral. each story in its own way teaches the reader a moral. when you start to remove books from libraries you are taking away the chance for a student to learn a certain moral from that book. you are sort of in a way trying to hide away reality when taking away certain books. no book should ever be taken off the shelves of libraries. every book removed from the shelves  is another learning experience taken away.     if there is a book that a child's gurdian disapproves of; keep it up to them to forbid their child not to read it. a book is simply a way to learn and explore the different things in life. censoring at the library can only keep kids away from the books for so long. every child deserves the chance to read any book they wnat, unless a gurdian forbids. it is not up to libraries wether a book is offensive or bad. that is soley based on the readers opinion, and everyones opinion is different. so again, if a gurdian really wants their child to stay away from certain reading material they can forbid their child by theirselves.     when libraries begin to censor books they take away the option to pick books. when you limit the themes of books in your library, some kids @month just pick up less and less books as time goes by. everyone enjoys a differnet kind of book, leaving options open gives everyone the chance to find a book they like. although some stories @month seem like a bad option, it is not until the reader has begun to read that he or she can figure that out. leaving options open for students is the best idea, because more kids @month actually read.     all in all libraries should not censor books or any kind of reading material. everyone is different even when it comes to reading a book. people like their options to be open and at a wide range. each book tells a differnt story and teaches a different moral. so leave the options open to the children and let them learn from the stories they choose. some books helps teach a moral or get a point acoss. also some books help prepare a person for the outside world. taking away certain reading materials is taking away the chance for a child to learn the things that are actually going on around them. in conclusion censorship is a bad idea and should be left to the gurdian of a child
3 i think that they should remove books, and take away more stuff from the kids now a days, because they are getting worse in worse like everyday, i think they should move the @num to @num, so atleast they are old enough to read, hear, or watch whatever they want, but they should go through and do a self-check on everything that they put out  in the stores.they should also have different parts in a library so that the little ones dont get to the adult section, such as adult books, that have stuff in them about sex, drugs, or anything else that falls under that catagory. i have @num little brothers, and they are @num, @num, @num. they know more stuff then my parents, and its because now a days kids pick up on stuff a lot more easier. so i say we as in the @location citizens need to watch out on how we put stuff out there that the kids can get a hold of.          when i was growing-up i didnt know as much as my little brothers do today, and that is because everyday they are coming out with something else everyday that can effect our kids, brothers, or whoever. i also do think the schools should have a class about the stuff that kids are experiencing in todays life, in like elementary school, so that when they get older they will already know about the drugs, or the sex life. kids also remember stuff a lot more when they are growing up, so if we put it in there heads at a really really young age, they will remember it. im not saying that kids will stop doing what they are doing, but atleast the percent population will go down, and parents will be a lot more happier. i also think that parents should stop lying to there kids about sex, making up stories so that there kid wont know, they need to stop doing that because they are going to find out about it sooner or later, so why not now? they whould be more aware of the real life in how it is out there, so all the parents out there should not lie to there kids about the sex life.                so thats what my person input is on the situation. i wish this would change sooner or later before the world becomes a big mess.
3 when i go to a library i @month find some stuff that is offensive to me. but if somthing is offensive to me the person beside me @month not  think the same thing  is offensive to him or her. when people try to put boundaries on what is offensive and what is not they can not . there is a wide variety of people that all have diffrent opinions based on their history.      what i think is offensive @month be seen as the best thing that has ever been printed, published, or recorded and other people's eyes. the major problem is that offensive doesn't have a set definition. i don't think that you will ever find a definition that everyone can agree on. there needs to be a limitations to keep certain things away from certain age groups. for example you would not want a kindergarder to be able to check out a @caps movie.      some censoring has to be done to protect people.but it all comes down to common sense. we won't ever all agree on what is offensive but if we use are common sense the problem @month be solved
4 i believe that libraries should have more cencorship. some books, magazines, and movies should be removed or grouped by age. from my own experiences of reading or seeing people read these books, i believe they should be removed because they influence violence, sexual activity, and drug use. young children should not be exposed to those things yet.     first, i think books that contain violence should be removed. i believe that children are the easiest people to influence. i also believe that violence is the worst thing to be influenced by. violence in books can influence killing. fighting and killing is not good. no young child should be able to check out about full of shooting and fighting. the book will make the kids think thats the right thing to do if they are able to check it out. being influenced by violence will make you commit crimes. reading a book is not worth going to jail for.     next, i believe that all sexual activity material should be removed from libraries. sexual activity should not be exposed to children until it is time for them to start learning about it. for example, a young girl reading about teen pregnacy not being a problem. the reader will think that is what she is suppsed to do which is wrong. books and magazines containing sexually explicit words should not be able to be viewed by young children. those thing @month influence kids to do things they should not even be thinking about doing. you can atleast sort them all in an adult section.     finally, drug use should not be issued in books to kids. children should not read or watch anything that are talking about drugs in a positive way. unless it is about saying no to drugs and not using them, children should not read them at all. drugs make people do things that their right mind don't want them to do. children should say no to drugs and to books that are influencing the opposite.     in coclusion, that is why i believe that we need censorship in our libraries. we need censorship because of viloence and drug use. also becuse of sexual activity and many more things
3 'all of us can think of a book that we hope none of our chilren or any other children have taken off the shelf. but if i have the right to remove that book from the shelf--that work i abhor--then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. and then we have no books left on the shelf.'( paterson) katherine paterson believes that if she can take a book off the shelf that she doesn't like anyone can. that should be the right way, but i don't agree. i don't think people should be able to take a book off the shelf just because they find it offensive. they don't have to take the book.     i don't believe there should be censorship in libraries. if people find a book offensive they don't have to look at it or check it out. other people might enjoy that book. likeing a book is an opinion. for exmaple, if someone doesn't like your outfit you're probably not going to go and burn it or throw it away  because that is just that one persons opinion. that is how it goes with movies, books, music, and magazines. everyone likes something different so their should be different books.      when you don't like a book i beleive the only time it would be right for you to take that book off the shelf would be if it was in your house. then you can take that book off the shelf and throw it away or whatever you want to do with that book. if you had the whole town vote to get rid of a book and ninety-five percent voted to get rid of that book then i think it would be okay. you can't just think about yourself when it comes to public things, you need to think about the whole community.     i read an article about banning '@person' from schools, i didn't think that would be a good idea. '@person' was one of the top picked books by high school students. if parents didn't like their kids reading it they should have just told them not to read it. i don't think it's right for parents to just go in the school and say they didn't like that book and take it off the shelf. i t's not fair to other readers who enjoy reading '@person @person'.     choosing what book to read is your opinion so you don't have to read a book you dislike. people like all different books so it's not fair for them to not able to read the book they like just because other people don't like the book. what if someone didn't like a book that you loved? would they just be able to take it off the shelf
3 there are different types of books, movies, magnazines, and tape recorders in libraries. books can be fiction or nonfiction. however, books or any other items can be offensive to people but to others it is just a book to read. so therefore, libraries should not remove books or any other items from the shelf.      who picks out the books, movies, magnazines, and tape recorders? the answer is the customers at the library. the authors of the books or items did not. the authors gave the decision to choice between books or items. no one can blame the authors. also, there are different kinds and different types of writtters or artists. writters and artists took their time for completing a novel or series for us to read or hear. people should not take it seriously about books or other source because it can be nonfiction are fiction.      my next example why libraries should not remove items off the shelf is it might offensed someone but not to others. for example slavery can offensed a colored person but to others it is just a historical event. people need to know what happened in the past with historical events. people need to read the introduction before checking out the book to know if they like it or not. therefore, people should not try to remove it.                    if a child checks out a book and their parents let them, it is the parents fault. it is there fault because parents let their child check the items out. also, if a person has a problem with books or any other sources then complain but the libraries should not remove it from the shelf. like i said before, one person might not like the book or other source but another person might like it.           libraries are for people to check out books or other sources, and not to remove books or other source off the shelves.
3 i do in deed believe that certain material should not be in public libraries, or places where young people can see it. things, such as pornagraphic material should not be out in the open where kids can see it. i think we would all believe the same way when we say that kids do not need to be seeing these things.     i personaly have been in a movie rental shop, and seen some of the movies that my parents would not want me to see. material such as this should be put away somewhere out of sight, and requested if wanted.     i also have a religious view on all of this. i know that it is a sin to look at the things such as porn and so the people in charge of the shop, or library ought to respect me and my religion. @person in the @caps says that if eating meat causes his brother to stumble than he will not do so. we need to have the same aspect on life. if something causes someone else harm we should not do it.     this is an issue that we face every day, and the reason i am using pornagraphic material is because it is everywhere. if i am standing in the @organization check out line i see the people magazines and i find it verry offensive!     i will say though, if you are old enough to live by yourself than you can look at whatever you want. i just find it untollerable to post these materials were viewers who do not want to see them have to see them.
3 if everyone in the world could permantly take a book, movie,music, etc., off the shelf because they think it is offensive would there be any of those thing left for us to enjoy?      i personally think that if people could do that they would, but is everything someone else finds offensive really offensive to you? no, it might not be, so does that give that person the right to pull it off the shelf permanatly so no one else can read it? i think no one has the right to pull that item off the shelf because of there own opinion of it.     if anyone could do that would there ever be uniqueness in people? i dont think there would be. just because you think the music a person listens to is offensive does not mean they think the same. thus it shouldnt be taken away from that person if he/she enjoys listening to it.     on the other hand i understand that some people might listen to music or read books that has offensive language and that they would not want there children hearing or reading that but that does not mean the music or book should be pulled from the shelf. ask yourself if you would react the same way to a person who uses offensive language what should we do then? you can just take that person out of the world.     so i guess the point im trying to get across is that just because you think its offensive and dont like it doesnt mean everyone in the world thinks that. to end my acticle i want you to think about whats offensive to you @month not bee the same for others.
4 the contents of the books in libraries vary in many way. some are children's books, some are adult books, and some are in between. libraries have books that spark interest in a reader. not all books are made for a particular age group or gender. which that should not mean that a library should be picked apart because of the contents of the novel,magazines,music,or movies. a library is suppose to be for anyone that enjoys to read a variety of materials, not just a select few because some people don't like the text or the meanings behind that book , song, or movie.     in the library, in our little town, splits up the variations of the reading materials,music,and movies. there is a children's section, that has all the books we all grew up with, in half the building. also an audult section for larger novels topics that teens and younger children would have no interest in or their parents would want them reading. another great thing is that they have books for people in between, like myself, with teen books that spark our interest.      with the ideas that people are writing about today we can not possible control what comes to their mind. some of the greatest books that are out are probably have the deepest meanings that some audiences don't prefere to listen to. but that is what is so great is that people have the liberty to go and find a book, or a magazine, or even @caps that they like.when freedom of what you read is taken away reader will stop reading. doesn't the admisistrations of schools want kids to read to get their test scores up? if you take away what they like to read doesn't that mean they will stop reading? also doesn't that mean the test scores will go down?     in my experience of topics that i have read about have been more grown up than my mother would like,but the fact of it is, is that people will read what they want. people don't like to be told no in my personal experience. taking away topics that are well liked even with words or contents of what they are reading is not fair to the readers. i believe that they should not censor books, music, movies, magazines, etc. because that would mean the libraries would be gone
3 i myself beleves that censorship in libraries should not be aloud. if their was to be any cersorship it should be from the parents of a child or if your not a child then you dont need censored. by censoring something as small as books, movies, and so on i think it will give people a fake sense of what really happens. just because something isent censored doesnt mean it should be taken out of context eather.     think of it like this if you walking down a street its not going be censor people will say bad words, show bad habits, and even go as far as seeing death or more. being a kid who really never been censored from anything including books ive learned alot but i feel as if i went to a librarie to get a book and if censored or taken off the shelf then i will shown a fake world. once again if life cant be censored then we shouldnt consor anything else.     a censored book, movie or whatever it @month be could also determin how much someone could learn from it. people go to liraries to learn hard facts with proff and evadience and depending on the subject in witch their looking up.     this is some of meny reasons i think cendor in libraries shouldnt be aloud. consorship should be chosen by who you are not by outher people. in the end we @month never know whats better till we try.
3 in my opinion, they should not censor books. they should be read the way that the author intended for @caps to be read. i understand censoring songs and movies, though, so that they @month be played on the radio and in the theaters.      the books that are contraversial right now have great messages, and should not be taken off the shelves because everyone should read them. they were written with this language because @caps's the way people talked back then. these books are classics and should not be changed, or removed from the shelves.     in the book 'to @caps a @caps @caps' by @person, they use a lot of bad language, but this is how they talked back then and the author is trying to convey a great message to the readers. @caps should not be changed     @caps is understandable that they would change songs and take out the bad language so that they can be played on the radio. when an artist writes a song, they know that @caps won't be able to be played on the radio if @caps has bad or graphic language. i don't think they mind changing a few words of their song so @caps can be played on the radio for all to hear.     the song '@caps you' by @organization, they replaced the @caps word with '@caps'. when he wrote this song, he knew that @caps wouldn't be able to play on the radio, so he changed a word, and @caps is still a good song.     movies are about the same as songs, they can't show a movie in theaters if @caps is too graphic. they @month take out certain scenes, or change a few words, but that doesn't change the movie. those scenes or words can be put back in the movie once @caps is sold in stores.     i undertand and respect everyones opinion on this matter, i am just voicing mine. if these authors, or artists, wanted their work to be different, they would've made @caps so.
3 censorship in librarys could be useful so children and young people don't see what their parents don't want them to see. in the kids section, they have kid's books. in the adult section they have adult books. those sections are there to keep children from reading or seeing things that @month be what their parents don't want them seeing. but then again, a parent could bring their kids into those sections so they can find their books without leaving their child unattended.     completely taking books out of the library because they are offensive is not a good thing. it takes away certain literature that people might like reading. but then it also makes those people that want it censored uptight. i am a big reader so i have been to librarys many times but i never actually saw any material that was so bad i thought it needed to be taken out. if there was though, they should just make an alternative section for books, music, movies, and magazines that some people think should be put there.      for example, some albums that contain offensive language or topics have '@caps @caps @caps' stickers on them. it's simple enough to see these stickers so that you can put it in the alternative section of a library. people that like and want to listen to that can easily go to that section and pick it out. books always have reviews, so people can tell if those are too @caps or not. the library staff could put those books in the alternative section. movies always have ratings, so staff could put anything rated @caps or above on those shelves. now i've never seen a bad magazine at a library before. i'm sure they would never have magazines such as '@caps' or '@organization' there. people wouldn't need to worry about magazines from my experience.      that is my solution. make an alternative section for all the offensive material in the library instead of taking it out completely. that takes away a lot of literature for the people that like that material. you couldn't take away movie classics like '@caps' or '@caps'. those movies have been put on the highest of best film lists. yes, they are rated @caps but no, that doesn't take away the fact that they are great movies. don't take the material out. just make a new section for it.
4 censorship in liraries, in my opinion is over-rated. everywhere you hear of book, music, magazines, and movies being offensive or degrading, but does that mean that they should be taken off the shelves of our public libraries, or out of book stores? i say no because, future generations need to know of the material, it @month not always be offensive, and the public libraries have no right to tell us what we can, and cannot read.     some say that our future generations will be greatly shorted of knowledge, or become naive because of this lack of knowledge. i say this is because of the censorship in libraries. katherine paterson once said 'all of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other chilren have taken off the shelf. but if i have the right to remove that book from the shelf-that work i abhor-then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. an then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' so if they're taking books off the shelve because they find them offensive, then there will be so many books gone, that the kids will not have a broder view as so many people are lucky to have today.     everyone has a different oppinion about everything, including what's offensive and what's not. if one person see's a book as being offensive, that doesn't necessarily mean that someone else will also. i've heard of teachers not letting the students see pictures of the @caps, because the think it's offensive. not everyone agrees with that. the @caps is a big part in history and it being catorgorized as offensive is wrong, it's not the only thing in history that is bad. if they start taking out big parts of history, it will be long lost and forgotten.     lastly i believe that the libraries should not be able to tell us what we can and cannot read. we have the right to choose what we want to read, if we think that it's bad and shouldn't be reading it, then we won't read it. but that doesn't mean they should take out the book because one person finds it offesive. someone else might want to read it. i think that people are mature enough to pick what they read, and as for children their parents are the one's that could pick for them.     with so many different oppinions it's hard to decide what to do about censorship, i believe that if it's offensive maybe they should have a special section for explicit media and reading. maybe then people wouldn't be offended by it. just because one person doesn't like it doesn't mean another wouldn't either.
5 if we were to take away every thing that someone in the world finds offensive, there would be nothing left. many people in different cultures find many different things offensive. it's not right to take away from others something becuase a select group of people take offense at it. something being offensive isn't always a bad thing. there's many different reason why, but removing something because of someone else's opinion isn't right.     first, whether you find something offensive or not, is laregly based on your culture. to most @caps cultures, declining food is offensive. to @caps, eating or hurting cows in anyway is a complete disgrace. if something is offensive to one person, it @month be because they have a different background. you're never going to please everyone.      second, one of the best thing's about the @location is that you can have your own beliefs. if something was removed from the shelf at a library, because someone found it offensive, i would be disturbed. i have my own beliefs that i'm sure not everyone agrees with. some of my beliefs wuold be offensive to certain people. that doesn't mean i should have to stay silent about my beliefs, does it? no, of course not. i wouldn't want anyone else's beliefs forced on me. i'm sure no one wants my beliefs forced on them. by removing things from a shlef becuase took offense at it, you'd be removing freedom of speech from the shelf also. that's not only wrong, it's illegal.     some people would be offended at a book with a cross on it. some people would be offended by a @caps cover with a pentgram. that doesn't mean they should be taken away. it's good to get offended sometimes. it often makes people stand up for what they believe. to me, it's reminder of why i believe what i do. i @month be angered by what i see. i'm sure the terrorist group @organization is greatly offended when they see the @caps flag. we wouldn't stop waving it, would we? that'd be absurd! just because someone takes offense at something doesn't make it wrong. it never has. it just means they have different beliefs. we should have the maturity to look away instead of demanding that it be removed.      i personally believe that removing things from the public eye, merely because they're offensive, would be wrong for many reasons. so many people find so many thigs offensive. it'd take away everythign if we removed eac and every one. removing offensive items would also be an intrusion of freedom of speech. plus, many things that are offensive often remind of of who we are. we should be string enough to look away and not fight about it. i don't think they should be removed. i want my library to be what @caps was made to be, a mixture of cultures and backgrounds. i don't think anything should be removed unless it directly causes harm to people
6 cooling the @caps: @caps and @caps from book @person               censorship in public libraries would be an insult to the institution. a library, a citadel of knowledge, should not be bound by a society as to what knowledge it can convey. one point of a library, the destination of researchers, is to offer information that must be sought: for those who cannot find the information in their homes without fear, for those who cannot ask their questions without retribution, the library stands as a pillar of safety. books are incapable of judgment.     to censor the books held in a library is to chip away at human progress. a freedom of thought and a freedom of press, present within our nation and increasing in presence around the @caps, precludes the idea of this censorship.     if any book is subject to criticism or opposition, are not all books worthy of the same? to value one opinion or perspective less than another is to debase the entire culture from which libraries have arisen. libraries are a communal institution, open to all views and writings. the point of bringing books together under one roof is to equate them, and give them all equal standing as literature or scholarly works.     from personal experience, censorship in the library has cost me precious time, and has stolen from me parts of my life. growing up in a small town, where ideas of gender and sexuality were somewhat firmly set, any search for dissenting opinion was often fruitless. when i visited my school's library, as a child searching for answers about my sexuality, i found little aid. around the library were a thousand stories of a man and woman falling in love, but never did i find a fairy tale of two princes. it was not until i left the school that i found that such books did exist in my old school library, but kept removed, off the shelves, restricted. more insulting than finding books of @caps issues completely unrepresented was to find that they were treated so separately.     here lies the problem. some people believe that if minority opinions or values are unrepresented, they will disappear. such is the point of censorship: ignoring an issue or a life-choice to the point of extinction. but books cannot shout their values. they cannot shove information down our throats. books must be read, we must give our consent to their knowledge. unlike an advertisement that might accost us unawares, we must pick up a book and open it to receive its guidance.     if my library had done its job and given me the guidance i sought, i would have grown so much more easily. i would have learned not only how to express and accept myself, but i might have grown to more easily accept others as well.     in the past few years, with the effects of @caps @caps @caps reaching the newest generation, @location has searched for ways to pay homage to the victims of the violence of @caps and of the @caps. what the country finds, however, is that it cannot effectively memorialize the tragedies. in trying construct a monument, the government and culture find that they have little to build off of. the products of murder and book-burning have resulted in an emptiness, a void. as such, architects have created what @month be called 'anti-monuments', commemorating a void to posterity to memorialize what was lost. one of the most powerful, to me at least, appears in the form of a negative bookshelf: a solid wall, with gaping holes in the form of book spines, ranging across the rows. such is the knowledge lost from book-burning. we cannot even describe what is lost, for the knowledge has vanished. we must ask, what are we missing? what views, what prose, what beauty has been taking from us while we continue living, never having the chance to glimpse it?     this is the effect of library censorship. to remove a book from its natural and rightful place on a shelf is to set its words aflame. once it is gone, it will be forgotten. to protect our posterity, to enlighten our descendants, we must work to preserve all books, any book that appears offensive, or disgusting, or brave, or new. let the reader decide its value. let the person in search of answers pick it up or leave it behind. give the book a chance for it @month have a power that is unrealized. leave the libraries as they are, as the monuments to the preservation and progression of knowledge and wisdom.
3 people all judge things differently. thats why i feel that libraries should keep those kinds of books. what @month be found as a offenisve book to one person might not to another one. if there are people saying that the certain books are offensive, then they should take them out of the library. you shouldn't take one book out because one person thinks it is offensive.          what might be offensive to one person @month interest another. the person that doesn't think it is, should have the right to read the book. that would be taking the rights for people away because a person finds it offensive. the person might find the book useful because they want to learn about the topic more. they will never get to learn about it if they take the book out because one person finds it offensive or doesn't like it.           i personally like watching movies or reading books that are thrilling and @month have some violence in them. if the library took these books or movies out because a mother saw her son or daughter read or waching then it would be wrong. the mother would be taking away what i like to read and watch. thats not fair at all. a way to solve this issue is to have certain areas for each type of age group; therefore, they would be watching or reading types of things acceptable for their age group.          i understand the fact that some people take things offensively. also that they don't want their children to pick up a book or movie that isn't acceptable for their age group. they have to understand though that sometime people like those type of things, and they are taking it away from the people who enjoy them. it is like taking rights away from people because they don't agree with what is happening. it wouldn't be right at all to take those books out of the library.                     all people have different views about things. you can't change a thing if one person doesn't like it. people have rights to pick up a book if they want to or not. not everyone is the same, so not all people are going to think the same way. i like things that some people might not like, that is just how human nature is
3 booksdear @person,@caps @caps staring to tell you about the books in the libraries that some adults find offensive so for the kids. these books should be taken away so kids won't read them, second part is adults should protest so the libraries could get does maganzines away or etc, and my last thing is @caps do libraries get these books and let kids take them so they could read them.the first example @caps giving is i founded some books and other things that i search being offensive for kids. and the libraries letting kids read them without an i.d because they are for adults reading sections. these books need to be away so kids won't read offensive things or trying to them. they should pbs books so under age children could read and so parents don't have to be worry about there kids what they are reading in there free time.the second example is parents should protest so books or other etc things could be rid of. parents need to protest so any thing they find offensive should get off of the shelve. or another thing is they will have to make a list of what books are offensive and let only adults read them by having an i.d and could sound a little better so books or etc don't get rid of the books.the last example is @caps do libraries let kids take them home and read them.they should what kids need to read like educational books for school or for other things. adults need to see what there kids read this days. kids need to understand what books are good for them from there age and otherwise their brain will start confusing them at their age.the conclusion is that libraries need to make something up so children don't read these kind of books that the only thing will do is mess up with there brain and then there parents will need to pay so their children could take therapy and others kids so their brain could be better. so please libraries do something so parents don't need to worry about what there kids read these days. like for me i won't like my kid read offensive things because they will start doin the same things so libraries do something about these on offensive things.
3 do i believe that certain materials should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive? no, i do not believe they should be, but that is my opinion.     it is pointless to remove them from the shelves because the children are going to see that kind of material outside of school, so why should we remove it? music, movies, magazines, and books all have material such as; racism, murders, innopropriate language, etc. when we find materials, like those listed before offensive outside of school, we stay away from them. we ignore it and watch or read something that we do not find offensive.      movies and books about @caps @caps are sometimes found offensive to some people and if we remove them from our libraries then we can not have references for when we right essays over those topics. it would be hard to get the right kind of information off the internet because not everything is correct on there. one hundred percent of factual books is correct. you will have no worries then.     therefore, i do not believe that certain materials that are found offensive to some people should be removed. it is a pointless task to do. children see it outside of school and stay away from it then so they can stay away from it in school also.
3 first off, i do like censorship laws to an extent.  however, the government cannot ban everything that they deem innapropriate.  i think it depends more on what the family deems innapropiate.     i do not think they should have any completely inaccessible areas in libraries for children of younger ages.  i believe that the viewer should have a family member's consent to view said content.  i also believe that if the content is not relative to the viewers interests, then they should just not look at it.  they are not required to look at it so if they do not like it, then they do not look at it.     however, if the library does not consent to holding the books, music, movies, magaines, etc., then they do not have to and the viewer can go somewhere else.  and if they do have the books, music, etc., then they can put limits and ratings on them.  but i do not think that an adult could go in and complain about innapropriate material.  as i said before, if they do not like it, then they are not required to look at it.     i actually think that the government should not tolerate parents whining and complaining about the content of different materials.  one parent should not have the ability to take away others' privilages to books, because they deem it innapropriate.  just because they do not like the content, does not exclude all others from enjoying it.     also, if a library does have an age restriction on certain materials, then appropriate acts of discipline should be taken for the viewer of said materials.  however, if the viewer has an adult family member with them and has their consent, then i think they should be able to view the material, regardless of ratings.
4 there are so many books and magazines, music, and movies to be discovered in this world. some are funny, sad, wierd, scary, etc. and then there are some that are questionable to others on wheather it was even nessecary to even put the the material on the shelf of a library in the first place. i for one am not one of those people who would question a book, magazine, movie or music. i believe that everyone's voice needs to be heard somehow and if we all take a voice away that we do not like, then we will lose a lot of voices.     we are all entitled to our own opinion. when it comes to some things some are more opinionated than other, but in the end we all have something that we feel strongly about. there are some people who want to express their feelings with the whole world with people that understand and agree with what they feel. if we take that away from people, then how will we all connect? some things @month come across as offensive to others, but who has the right to say that something should not be shared with the rest of the world. i have observed that when people have the same interests in things like music, books, or movies then it gives people a way to come together and talk about something. i have witnessed at concerts everybody seems to connect because we are all there for the same reason, to see the band or person that we all like to listen to. everybodys different and likes to have their own personal preference on something. like katherine paterson once said, 'but if i have the right to remove that book from the shelf-that work i abhor-then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. and then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' i think she was trying to say that if we all take a book off the shelf that we do not think should be on there, then there is going to be nothing left for anybody to read. then what will we do?      theres such a variety of materials that are needed to be discovered wheather it is a book, music, or movie everyone has their own special type that they enjoy. i do not think that censorship is a good idea for any sort of material on a shelf. theses materials are what keep people connected with each other. i think it is very important to not censor anything because it does not just give the writer a voice, it give a voice for the people that agree with the material of the book, movie, or music
3 libraries should have whatever they want in the library. everyone has their on thoughts on things. if you don't like what they have on there shelfs then don't go there any more or pick up something you like. everyone is different so you can't just take offensive stuff off the shelves, it might be offensive to one person, but not to someone else.      materials, such as book, music, movies, magazines you can't just start taking stuff of the shelves just because there offensived you. the only way i would say take books or magazines off the shelves is if the facts are not right.       libraries hold almost anything anybody needs materials, books, music, movies, magazines and everythings for facts. so don't start taking stuff off your shelves. teenagers might have to write a paper about something that people think is affensive, if you don't have everything in the library then we won't have good facts. no one in this world agrees on anything, all you would be doing would be picking a fight if you taking of offensive.libraries are open to any one that wants to read about almost anything they want to read about.       music everybody has there on type of music you can't just start taking music of because you think it's offensive. most people have there own type of everything.     children is there own person you can keep them from whatever you want to, the thing is you can't hold them back in life. they get older you won't be able to tell them want to do or want not to do. if you keep them from a book or etc they might end up reading it in the long run. keep you kids safe is inpormant i understand your kids are going to expirects things you don't want them to. just by taking offensive stuff of the shelves doesn't mean your kids won't fine them some where else.      i could understand if the books or magazines were offensive to you because it was about your family, but of time your going to have offensive come up in your life. that means your going to have to not let it get under you skin or get over it.      things get under people skin to easy. this is why the world don't get along. if you don't like something don't me around it. fine something unless to read about. thats what i do if i don't like something.
5 katherine paterson once said, 'all of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. but if i have the right to remove that book from the shelf- that work i adhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. and then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' i believe that the books and other items should stay in the shelves of the library that censorship in libriaries is unnecessary. as katherine paterson stated there will be no books left on the shelves if you take every book off that someone in the @caps  finds offensive. what is offensive to one person @month not be considered offensive in another persons point of view. children, teens, and adults have their own right to choose whatever book they want to read, movie they want to watch , or music they want to listen to. if it is a child or a young teen then i believe that the parents should have a say in what their children read or watch. in my case i am not allowed to listen to offensive music or watch rated @caps movies but that shouldn't mean that it should be taken off the shelves of the library. just because that is what my family believes to be right does not mean it is the only wat to live.     a person has their own rights to choose what they want to read, watch, or listen to. they can make the choice by the way they have been raised or just because that is what they think is right or wrong. if they think that a book is offensive then they don't have to read it, they have the right to say no and put the book back on the self. if they think that the book is approriate then they can read it and there is no law stating that they have to share the book with anyone else. if there is a book out there that is offensive in your view and you read it there is no reason you have to agree with it. every person is free to disagree with anything they want to disagree with.      if you are a parent to a child and you are uncomfortable with them reading, listening, or watching something that is offensive you should set the rules early in life with them. parents should make sure that their children are not reading inappropriate things or listening to offensive music or watching @num or rated @caps movies. therefore, if you are comfortable with your children seeing and hearing offensive things then you don't have to worry about what is out there in the @caps.the things that your children are watching, reading, listening to isn't a problem and if it becomes a problem in the parents eyes then they have the right to stop the children from reading the offensive books or watching the bad movies and listening to the music that the view as offensive. every parent and family is different, as long as your child knows the rules and what you believe in then there is no need for censorship in libraries.      in my family i am not allowed to listen to offensive music. offensive music in my house is considered music with curse words in the lyrics. the words that my family considers offensive @month be different then what other families consider offensive. i know that i don't want to and can't listen to those certain songs but that does not mean that i can't be friends or be around people that listen to that kind of music. just because that is what my family believes in does not mean that it should be taken of the shelves of the library or any other place. what my family believes in @month not be the right thing in another familys view. every person has their own right and if they want to listen to that music then they should be able to. my family also believes that at my age right now i should not watch rated @caps movies. if you took all the rated @caps movies off the shelves, then half the movies would be gone and that is not fair to the people who enjoy rated @caps movies. what my family believes @month not be what other families believe in. i know what i stand for and i will do what i think is right and i won't listen to offenesive music or watch rated @caps movies. in no way though does that mean that other children, teens, adults shouldn't enjoy that kind of music and those movies.     in conclusion, i believe that censorship should not be used in libraries. it is every persons own right and they are capable on making decisions that they think are the right thing to do. parents also have a say in what they want their children to watch, read, or listen to. they can montor what their children are reading, watching, or listening to and if they find it offensive they can stop their children. it is not necessary to take the items off the shelf. in my family, my parents find some types of music and movies offensive and i know when i go to the library or any other place that i won't get those items. i will get the music and movies i enjoy and find age appropriate. just as in @person's quote everyone has the same rights and if we all take the items we think are offensive off the shelves, then there will be nothing left on the shelves. everyone has a different point of view and no one person has the correct or wrong point of view that the @caps has to follow
2 should books, magazines, or movies that are found offensive be removed from the shelves? i think that the book, magazine, or movie should stay on the shelf even if it is found offensive. if it is offensive to one person, it doesn't mean that it is to every person. everyone has their own view on the subject of offensive or not.     i don't think the person that wrote the book or magazine meant for it to be offensive. they were just writing what they thought went along with the story and some people took offense from the book or magazine. but, they shouldn't argue over it because, like i said before, the author probably didn't mean for it to be offensive.     in conclusion, the books should stay on the shelves. everyone has different point of view. the author probably didnt mean for the book or magazine to be offensive.
2 i think that if u feel like they are sayin bad thing that you should not read the books or magazines and dont lisen to the music and dont look at the moves.          if you feel offensive about it just dont look at it because a porson might not find it offensive.it is port of life to look at something offensive so why do it now. i think that if they do that they might just take some @caps.vs shows off the air becuas there are a lot off shows out there that are offensive and some do not like that but they dont take it off the air so why take books music, movies, and magazines off the shelves.    i dont believe that they should do that at all becuas if i dont like it i dont look at it so i dont get mad at something somebody say bout my believe.    a porson might not like the same music u like i might not like the same music he or she likes but i dont wont to take it off the shelves they should just stop lookin and lisning to all this stuff a porson says about there believe.
3 censorship in libraries     i know as well as everyone else does, that you can find almost anything, reading related, in the library. there is all different kinds of stuff in there. from children's books, to love stories and people's magazines, newspapers, movies, and music. everyone is welcome in the library, of course, but is everyone aloud to look at whatever they want?     i personally think it's a good idea to have all of this stuff in the library, for anyone, even though some of it's not very appropriate. for people who sit at home and don't have a library, maybe they want to know about something specific and the first place they would think about going is the library. nobody can really help with what people @month find in the library but i think it's a good idea to keep that kind of stuff in a public place. you could go on the internet to get whatever information you need, yeah, but, what if the internet doen't have what you're looking for? i like books better then internet myself. anybody can put information on the computer, but atleast when it's in a book, it's true, because it has to be published and read by someone that wouldn't let a book with false information be sent out to the public.     if the libraians are worried about underaged kids getting into books that they're not suppose to, then put it somewhere where they can't reach. put the adult books in the adult section, and don't let the little kids go in that area. you could always put them up high too so the kids wouldn't even know they was there. all the libraries i've ever been to, had their own sections, the adults would go to their section, and the kids would go to their's. if the parents are afraid of what their kids will find, then keep them home and don't let them go to the library. make your own at home, then you could put whatever books and magazines you want in there
3 yes, i think they should be removed from the shevles. some books, music, movies, magazines, etc. are overated and young children go to visit the library. they should have a shelve for kids, tennagers and grown-ups. everybody should have they own section for their age group.          young kids are already doing things that they shouldn't be doing, like hanging out in the street, hang with older kids. they watch inappropriate movies, when they should be watching something educational. the music they have out now days, children shouldn't listen to it. it's to much cursing and violent. more parents need to spend more time with their kids and talk to them about these things.          there are certain things tennagers should watch and read too. i don't think they should read about killing or sex. i rather their parents talk to them about that and stop hiding things from them. parents will eventually find out what you doing behind close doors, they been through everything you doing or trying to do now. so just talk to them and be real about things.          i think they should be certain magazines in the library. young children beat theyselves up, because they don't look like the young actors and actress in the magazines. they try to rush their life and be somebody they not meant to be. young ladies want to have big boobs and butt. then, young men want to have big mucles and be buff.          in conclusion, i don't think books, music, movies, magazines, etc. should be removed from the shelves. there should be a shelve for young kids, tennages and adults. the music that is played on the radio now days, shouldn't be on there. magazines shouldn't out on shelves for children to reach. there are certain things tennagers should watch and read.
2 i do not beleive that certain materials such as books, music,, movies, magazines and ect. should be remove, unless if it has nudity or a lot of cussing in the books. because some books and movies are bad to show little kids. but i think we should have anything, that teaches you something in the labrary. plus people have to do reports and homework on some books, and if its about something with a little cussing and kinda graphic it should be ok. i think if the library have these kind of books, movies, music and magazines they should let you if you are a certain age or have a note from a teacher that you need that book, or some kind of rule that lets you choice any kind of book but with permission.     the library's would have more people going if they had more books and better ones. because most of the things that people like is in the books or movies that the library wont have. so it just depends on the situation. there is a lot of offensive things out there, it doesnt mean you can keep it away from people. they will find out anyways sooner or later. i think its unnessary for the libraries to do that. i always hate when i try to get something when you find out you have to be @num or older or have an adult with you. plus some people dont have computers or enternet excess, so they cant look up things easly. they have to drive down to the library to look something up and if you are lucky they might have the thing you are looking for at the library, but if they dont that sucks. so thats my opinion about have offensives things on the shelves.
4 there are big debates today over whether or not certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves of libraries if they are found offensive.  plenty of arguments are made from maybe somebody's own experience, observations, and/or reading.  i have read plenty of people's concerns regarding @caps issue, and there are some valid points to be made from both sides of the story.  no matter what your opinion on @caps issue is, there will always be someone who opposes of it.  you see censorship of offensive language on television, but here is my take on whether or not censorship should take an effect on books, music, movies, magazines, etc.     the first point that i would like to make about censorship is that people all across the world have come in contact with something that they @month have thought to be offensive.  when kids are old enough to understand what other people are talking about, they will come in contact with things that they take in offense at some point in life.  i know from my own personal experience that you will see things that people think should be censored.  although i come from a religious family who does not like to offend anyone, i am old enough to realize that not everything in life is going to work out your way all the time.  when you honestly think about it, you cannot censor out things that you hear in person, so why censor things in certain materials?     the second point i would like to make about censorship is that no matter how much you try to censor certain materials, people will still find a way to take things offensive.  there are certain things in life that you cannot control, and being insulted or offended is one of them.  even the most popular man or woman on the planet has been offended at least once or twice.  it isn't about trying to censor every little thing that @month be offensive to some people.  maybe it is about the people learning to deal with a little criticism.     'all of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.  but if i have the right to remove that book from the shelf---that work i abhor---then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else.  and then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' @caps is a quote from katherine paterson that makes a big statement.  almost every well-written book that you will find on the shelf has something that should be censored.  what would those books be without those statements?     to conclude @caps debate on censorship, plenty of arguments have been made about the views of censorship.  many observations, personal experiences, and/or readings have been done by many different people.  truth is, there will always be people who disagree on @caps subject, but that is just the way things are. we @month never know who is actually right or wrong about @caps topic.  we do know though, that judging form the previous points above, it is very unlikely that certain materials will be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive.
3 @caps is the freedom of speech to be able to read, right and listen to whatever you want but under some conditions.i think that all books should be aloud to stay on the shelf. like i said as americans we have the freedom to do and say how ever we feel about something without being worried about what will happen. but we should also think about what we are doing and saying and if something is wrong or harms someone. we should take rightfull ownership to our mistakes.but i do agree that some books should be taken off the shelves if they provide thoughts our ideas to cause downfall to our country. such as terrorist groups drug and alachol books should be taken off so we do not pullute the minds of our youth. our youth today is very influenced by the music we listen to the books we read and the television we watch. from these things @caps shows us how to act, dress, feel, and treat other people @caps is the freedom of speech but say the right thing and be careful of what you say because some day @caps could effect you.
3 people should not take all the books out for the librarie. beacuse other peolpe would probley like to look at those books also.  if people start taking books out, all the book  will be gone .so  that would mean  where would be no books form people  to look at. so thats why there should be a law that you can only have a book out for a given period of time . that would help to kept all the books in the liberary.      so if people just start talking the book for the liberary there wont be any book left in the liberary to check out. so there needs to be a law that says that you can check out a sarthen numbers of books at a time. and how long you can have the books for . if you dont bring the books back in a certain amount of time you will be charged. the amount will build up every day you dont bring ther books in. also if you dont bay the bill you dont get to check out books until you bay the ammount. so that would be a good idea for people not to steal or take the books.     about the book, moives, and magzines  that are the liberary.   all the books ,moives and magzines should stay on the shelves. because if you take out one you should take out all off them. beacuse every one needs to see  these thing in life even if it has some thing bad like a  movie  or a magzine it should stay on the shelves.     so if a book,magzine,or movie gettes taken off the shelfes all of them need to be taken off the shelf .just becauseit not fare to there author , beacuse they toke time to make what ever they did. if you get them mad thill stop making book for me and you to read.     so thats what i think about the things you should do if you try to take books off the shelf in the liberary.but if its some thing really really bad mabey you should get it taken off the shelfs at the liberary or at any where they sell that book,moive and magzine.
3 should certain materials be removed from your public library? not everyone has the same views as eachother. what might be offenses to you, @month be enjoyable to someone else.      i personally don't believe that anything should be removed from a library, just because something you might not like someone could really enjoy. if you don't want to learn about something you shouldn't take that away from others who do.      i think that if they do start removing things from library shelves they should still be allowed to be viewed to those who want to. even if you just put them away would be better than taking them out of the library completely.      more and more books are banned everyday, and i personally don't think that's fair to the growing generation who don't get to enjoy the things the old generation have.      so i believe that no books should be removed from library's. if you don't believe or enjoy something doesn't mean someone else wont
3 have you ever been to a library? have you ever thought that some material from the libraries could and have been found offensive and wanted them to be removed from the library? i'm here to talk about the content of libraries and what we should do with them.           every time you walk into a library, you are surrounded with books and other learning or reading material. yes this material is helpfull in finding things to pass the time or to help understand a certain subject, but some have been found offensive. stories such as romance novels or vulgar horror and action stories have been viewed as innapropriet to some ages. these novels contain anything from brutal horror, to adult material, or foul language. parents argue that these books should be removed from the libraries.      i do not agree. i beleive that such books and novels can be a great help to the immagination of others and get the mind flowing. yes i do agree that some novels are not age apropriate for young children, but that does'nt mean that they should be removed. i think that if people are so worried about their children reading these books that they should either go into the library with their child, or simply give the child a certain area that they are allowed to pick a book from.      another way of avoiding these wrightings getting into the wrong hands is to section off the more aggressive and adulterated books to a certain spot in the library and allow only age apropriate people inside. an age restriction of thirteen years and up would be a responsible decision. an age younger could be innapropriate for them, but any older and it could keep them from learning and expanding their mind to it's full potential.     the point of this writing is to show that removing these books and novels from the libraries is not going to help anything. if anything it could hurt us by not allowing our minds to reach newer and higher limmets by learning and understanding the complexity of these novels. sectioning off these novels in an age apropriate area or having parental discression will help to keep the age correct for the books that they get
5 dear @caps @caps,     i strongly agree that certain materials should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. there are young chirlderen that will pick up a book, movie and/or @caps case, or even a magazine and read off whatever the front says. we @caps't need younger childeren reading off whatever they know what to say. @caps's already bad enough that they hear @caps from family members or @caps near them. the seller could also make an edited verison of the book, movie, @caps, or magazine.      the sayings,'you @caps't like @caps, than @caps't look.','@caps't got anything nice to say, than @caps't say anything at all.',and 'if you wouldn't want to hear @caps, than @caps't say @caps.',strongly apply to this. the way this world is coming to, @caps seems like they @caps't really mind who sees their product, as long as @caps are buying their product.     now a days, @caps seems like the younger the child is, the smarter @caps'll be. if a four-year-old picked up a @person @caps case, saw a pretty much naked grown adult on the case doesn't put a good thought in their head. that child's gonna grow thinking, '@caps's okay to be naked. @person did @caps. why can't i?'. childeren learn more things from family and freiends, before they start learning the truth in school.        @caps's just like you wouldn't want to take your child to the @caps @caps, half naked to naked woman just walking around freely. not something a little five-year-old needs to see. just like a little five-year-old doesn't need to hear cussing or using the @caps@number name in vien.     having young childeren see, hear, say, think, or read things like that puts thoughts in their heads, making them think @caps's okay to say whatever you want or to dress however they want, while they think @caps's perfectly natural. although, this @month seem like a huge wake up call to some parents, but @caps's not normal. @caps's not more normal than telling your kids that they were a mistake. things like that shouldn't be said to/ near childeren.      every parent wants the best for their child, they @caps't want their childeren growing up in world that is full of bad nor do they want their childeren doing wrong. by letting companies sell their prodcut with half naked @caps on the front cover of a magazine or @caps case, or by selling books that talk about murding someone, hiding the body, and prays to @caps that they @caps't get caught, or by playing music that is offensive in stores with younger kids, let's them think that they can sell whatever they want, promote their music where ever they want, makes the companies win.      i'm not a mother, nor am i soon-to-be-a-mother, but i find @caps highly offensive that companies and stores would do that. i wouldn't want my child looking at a magazine than asking me questions about the @caps nearly naked, or have them ask me what a word means when @caps's a cuss word. i certainly wouldn't buy a book that just looks strange or offensive to my child.      as well, i strongly do believe in '@caps of @caps', so the companies, in a way, do have a right to sell their product how @caps is. just, if they really wanted to selll their product that much, that bad, than they should sell @caps online. @caps @month cost more, but at least everyone would know that their childeren wouldn't see @caps. although, once you owned @caps, than @caps's the buyers fault if their child saw @caps. that would be on the parents plate to deal with.      another thing with childeren, is that their brain is still developmenting at that young age, their imagintion is beyond fairy tale world, @caps's kinda like their second home, only @caps's inside their brain. their brain is still developmenting and learning new things each and everyday. once they go to the store with their parent (s), they're already jumping up and down off the walls for a new toy or a new pair of shoses, or just because they wanna run up and down the alies, @caps's bad enough having them see something inopporty.      i know i wouldn't let my childeren see things like those and i'm about @percent certain you wouldn't want your childeren seeing those things. so, for the childeren's sake, think of them, their minds, and their developmenting brains and their off the wall imagaintion. treat the childeren how you were treated growing up.                                   thank you,                                   @person
6 first comes censorship along with its totalitarian prowess, second comes the downfall of humanity. we have all seen the horrors of totalitarianism over time. from the @caps regime of @location to the banning of @caps in the @caps empire. it always is a terror that falls violently.     farenheit @num was written by @person in the mid twentieth century, forshadowing a wicked future if censorship is brought to humanity. the human populaion will no longer have actual knowledge, only what they have been told. in this book, the population is forbidden from having any kind of book. their history is completely makeshifted by the government into a psychological madness. as if propaganda doesn't warp the minds of people enough, censorship of books would be the end.     man must know his foundation and where he comes from. all it takes is one little book to be taken of the shelf. eventually they all will start coming down til there are none. the government will erase history as it is and create one that warps the minds of all to believe the goverment is righteous. when the malignant being is the government itself.     this all brings up one of the worlds greatest questions. what actually should be kept out of viewing for all to see? we all think it is correct to keep pornographic material and adult language away from children. what is it that actually made these things intolerable in the first place? we have been taught our whole lifes that these things are, but when real censorship comes in, so does the apocalypse of all knowledge. people believe anything they are told as long as enough people are saying it.     i, without slight hesitation, stand against censorship in every way. people have the right to know everything. parents still have the ability to keep things they see as unacceptable from their children as much as they please to do so. let man choose what is intolerable to him. censorship goes against everything the western democracies stand for. all freedoms are taken away by that one word. the democracies feared communism due to its totalitarian government. the communists censored everything inside the @caps @caps.     history has shown us time and time again that totalitarianism is unsuccessful. the people must be free and must be able to live their own lifes. only then will they defend their countries so they can preserve freedom. both world wars resulted in totalitarian regimes beeing taken down by the free, uncensored men of the democracies.     a word is simply a word. people will always have their own views on everything. arguments about every little thing will always be at hand. we all must understand that although we all have differences in our beliefs, we must prevent censorship and accept all. the day we dont, censorship will come, and noone will have the right to believe in what they want. it is humanity's decision and it must be made at this time when the world is at its greatest. what will become of the uncertain future?
2 this statment is not right. peolpe should be alound to read what ever they went or linst to or watch what ever movie they went. when someone read somthing thats bad they @month or not like it. so people should not take away books, movies,and music that are bad.      one thing that peolpe should have a choose of what they read and other stuff. books some people like reading bad stuff beacuse they enjoy it. if the person do not like it they should put back and find somthing else to read. now movies are a lot of fun to watch. but when you watch a new movie you should rent it first to see if you like the offensive sence or not. and the age thing yay you should watch a movie with andult if your to young. now music is one thing that is offensive should not be takn off the shelves. becasue if you dont like it do not pick it up from the shelves and tell people thats bad music when it could be some great music. ok there is one thing that can be taken off the shevels is the magazines. its bad for people to be reading those tip of magazines. if they went them they should order them offline mail at their house.      so people should not take off the shelves are books, movies, and music but they can take away magzines.people like the books and stoffe that have bad stofe in them. and there should be no taking off the shevels. thats what i think of if somone toke somthing off the shelves.
4 the quote that katherine paterson declairs a very strong point and is completely true in my eyes. everyone thinks and functions differently so therefore something offensive to one person might be completely fair and good in anothers point of view.     everybody thinks different and as you go to school or work everyday you find that obvious by just about anything the person is doing or owns. for instance, their clothing. belongings can show a lot about a person just as much as actions or words. so what do you think? do you think that any material from the library should be taken off the shelf just because someone or a couple of people think its offensive or terrible? in my opinion, no. every book, magazine or anything in the media can send out a different message in everyones personal thoughts. for example, one movie could touch someone in a very special way and at the same time, someone right next to them could think it's disguisting and cruel. i have actually had a real life situation were this has been a conflict.     during the years of my seventh grade experience there was this playstation game that i loved to play and enjoyed playing every single day with all of my friends. my mother, and pretty much the entire @location found it very offensive. it was really awkward and annoying that one of the things i loved is something that they tried to ban and not allow it to be sold from local stores. now being in my shoes how do you think that felt for me? i thought it didn't feel very fair at all, it's selfish and inconsiderate. that's like taking somebody possessions and telling them your opinion on them and then ditching them into the trash to rote and vanish forever.      i believe that you should be able to read anything you would like in the library without the fear of your next favorite book being taking off of the shelf because a group of people protest from the language or whatever they think is offensive to them in the novel, because the next time you know it, everything will be gone from the shelves since everyone has different opinions. if you dont like the novel, then i assist you to return it, and to never read it again. i feel this conclusion is very fair and considerable. so what do you think as readers, is it fair to be able to read whatever you want or do you think if you or someone finds it offensive, you can take it off of the shelves?
4 the library is a public area where anyone can visit to find a book, movie, or magazine of their desire. not everyone is interested in the same book genre. the library is meant to have almost any book someone could think of. if someone discovers a book or movie that offends them, they should not make a big deal about it. they should not be removed from the shelves of the library.      i am against the removal of offensive entertainment because it is not fair to everyone else that is a member of the library. what if a group of adults enjoyed a movie that someone else thought was disturbing? if the library took that movie off of the shelves, they would lose business due to one person. if a mother of a six year old boy wanted to report an inappropiate movie to the librarian, it would not be fair to anyone that is mature enough for that movie. it just is not fair to everyone else.     the library is public property. with that being said, it is the library's job to please the public's desires for entertainment. they are obligated to suppy books, movies, etc. for whomever. if one person does not like a particular book or magazine, they should search somewhere else for what they want.      a few years back, my mom stopped taking my brother and i to the library. there were too many complaints about inappropiat books being supplied or taken off of the shelves. that year, the library lost @percent of their customers because everytime the library tried pleasing them, someone else was not pleased.      if every article of entertainment were to remain on the shelf in the library, everyone would be happy. if someone does not approve of a movie or something, they can search another shelf. those who complain are only making more work for themselves.
4 i do not believe books, music, and magazines should be removed from shelves. wherever you go in the world, whether you like it or not, your going to come in contact with things you don't find appropriate or you think are offensive. @time world is far from perfect. one reason i don't belive they should be removed is because it would be unconstitutional. the freedon of speech and the press was not ment to be tampered with. if a specific library thinks their articles are innapropriate, an easy solution would be to put these articles in a certain section of the library and warn people what they are.     the main reason i don't believe books, music, and magazines should be removed from the shelves is becuase the world is a nasty place and books are the least of your concerns. kids can't be sheltered their whole lifes, they need to face reality and books are a good source of that. kids these days are resiliant and can handle 'innapropriate' content. parents need to face the fact that their kids are going to be exposed to offensive things in @time imperfect world of ours. it's just a natural part of growing up.     another contributing factor is that it would be unconstitutional to remove books and other articles from the shelves of @location's libraries. when the amendments freedom of speech and press were written down they were intended to stay there. they are not guidlines that can be looked over, they are rules set in stone for @time great country. people to @time for freedom over much bigger issues than books. who are we to tell people what they can and can't write down. people's natural opinions can't and shouldn't be governed. i think it would be a crime against @location to censor things in libraries.     my final reason for not censoring libraries is that it all boils down to the people running the library. if they think some of their articles are profound and innapropriate, meerly isolate them to a certain section of the library and put a warning for people to see. if people don't want to be offended they simply have to just stay away from these sections. take responsibilty for what is in these libraries that is apparently so offending and put them in their own area and stay away from them, do not take them out completely, because who knows someone @month want that offending book.     these are all supporting opinions why i personally do not belive libraries should be censored. @time world is far from perfect and it's not going to become perfect by censoring libraries. plus @time act would be completely unconstitutional. finally all the libraries have to do is exile these articles to certain areas of the libraries and slap a warning on them. if libraries were censored there would be a lot of missing information in @time world because there are many things in @time world that are 'offensive' to atleast someone
4 everything is offensive to someone. there is no way to make sure nobody is offended unless you have nothing to offend anybody at all. if there is something on the shelf, someone can find something offensive in it. here is a good senario; there is a childrens book. it is one of the gratest books ever written, but it was written before the civil war and there is a racist comment in it. @caps good bye to that book. some people would probably think '@caps its only a childrens book. i'm sure we will survive.' @caps lets move on to a bigger idea. what happens when someone says the bible is offensive. @caps thats gone, but now its supports are saying the other people's entire religion is offensive. thats a couple more books. now we have violence.      moderate censorship is acceptable for the young, but there is a line, even though it is hard to find sometimes. obsence images that are illegal to view by a minor are acceptable but those that are legal should be seen without censorship. censorship for those who understand is unacceptable, although select items should be viewed under supervision. to strip the rights of a person is not acceptable.      the @location government has given people freedoms. one of those freedoms is the freedom of speech. this basically means i can say what ever i want and support whatever i want. a book is a form of speech. although some speech is looked down upon, it should not be censored. censorship is just basically saying; 'you can not say this.' that moves on to; 'you can not say.' then; 'you have no say.'     in developing countries, such as congo, if you go to the goverment and say what they are doing wrong and that you are agianst them, take a guess at what happens. they shoot you. a better word for that would be they censor you. if you write a book saying how obama could be a better president, but someone finds it offensive, what happens. they censor you. now you get no say in the matter because the supporters of obama dont want you to. do you see much difference?     supervisation is a powerful thing. guess what it can do better then censorship. with a supervison, children can still learn about topics but are not simply thrown into the obscene areas of it. a person is a human being. that includes children. the have a right to learn without the influence of others, but censorship denies them of that right.      censorship should not be used in libraries. it takes away freedoms and oppertunities for children. it causes violence among people. it scars culture, and ignores religion. although censorship has the ability to do more damage then any single person, it is not 'bad'. censorship was created to protect people from things that they feel to be wrong. but good intentions do not keep wrong consequenses at bay.
3 'all of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.' @caps does that mean well i guess it means if their is a book on the shelf then they probly dont want their children to get a hold of it. maybe there parents should look at the books first or maybe they should have taken it off the shelf. i think all books that have offensive stuff in them should be taken off the shelf.if i was going to take books off the shelf it would only be the offensive science fiction books. if @caps based on a true story and @caps offensive it should be heard anywise because @caps part of history. everyone needs to hear it because @caps true. if i was going to take music off the shelf it would only be the ones with a lot of bad language. for movies children should only whach @caps rated movies and nothing else. for magazines children should not read magazines they should be taken off the shelfs.the experiences i had with all these things when i was a child was my parents never let me whach anything or listen with anything with bad language. but i could read any book i wanted to. it was in a book @caps not like i could onder stand @caps that bad ward ment.i think @person saying is that she wants to keep all books on the shelf because she said 'you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. and then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.'  i think the point can go ether way because she says everyone has the same rights. and then she states that their wont be any books left for us. i think that means every book is bad if shes saying @caps i think shes saying.their is a way to leave the books, music, movies, magazines, etc.,  on the shelfs. like i sayed in the first pargraph there parents need to pay more attention to their children. and no @caps their reading. to sum it all up i say take them off the shelfs.
4 there should not be any style of censorship in the @location. i am a strong believer that our country is the best because we are allowed by law and the constitution to have our own ideals, likes, and even dislikes. i understand that libraries are a place for all people of all ages, but i do not believe that they should censor what they put on their shelves.      in the us we are known for accepting all different types of lifestyles, and religions; this is one reason i think censorship is against @caps policy. one of the things that sparked our countries secession from @location, was censorship. the @caps would not allow the colonies news papers to speak poorly of him or his ideas and policies; this is why when the us was formed the @caps @caps built freedom of ideals and speech into the constitution.      i do, however, agree with some censorship. the movie and song rating system is a form of censorship i believe to be needed. with out this form of censorship, small children would be aloud to see and hear things they are not ready for. this is also a good way for people to decide if they would like to experience the ideas and language presented by the matieral rated.     i think that there should be a rating system (or explanitory system) present in libraries. instead of pulling conservercial books off the shelves completly, we should rather put a warning on them. i feel strongly that i have a right as an @caps to read and experience any type of book, music, news, or picture i would like to see. if we start restricting what we as @caps are alowed to see, we start loosing our freedom; we become like those who live in comunist countries where only what the government wants you to see is seen. the statement made by katherine paterson supports my ideals greatly; especialy 'and then we have no books on the shelf for any of us'. this sentence shows that if we start pulling or restricting the things people deem offiencive, there would be nothing left to read or enjoy.     censorship in the @location is a direct violation of our consitiution. i am a believer in, if it bothers you or upsets you, dont read it. by doing this we can get rid of censorship, and be able to fully enjoy all our rights as @caps. we also allow our right to be informed to be excercised.
4 some books are offensive to some people. but eveyrone has the right to read any book they want. i believe we shouldnt censor books that are found offensive in schools. if people find offensive from the beggining, find another book to read or talk to the teacher.           i have had my experience with books who are offensive to me. everyone has a book they have read that does that to them. but that same book i have read might be interesting to other people. whatever doesnt @caps you makes you stronger, right? so don't take a book in a hurtful way. books are meant to be read and some authors direct the book to certain people.      i had poeple come up to me from our own school saying the books they read were a horrible experience. specially when all they talk about is suicide and one of my best friends has trouble with that because of her dad. i told her to talk to her teacher and he changed the book for her. thats all you have to do and not make anything big about it.      i also read the book, 'to @caps a @caps', which is censored in some states because its hurtful to some people. the story is about a white family trying to help an @caps-@caps man who was accused of raped when he never commited such thing. that was not acceptable at the time and with all the evidence in the world they still couldn't help him. its a great story about what black poeple went through in earlier years. and to think they would censor a story about a white lawyer trying to help someone who isn't his own race is inspiring to me, not offensive.      he got harrased and his children got harrased but he still fought with all he had to save his deffendant. i am a @num year old boy who when he read this book knowing who had a heart and who didnt made me cry my eyes out. it's sad to know this book is censored in some states when this is defenitely one of the best books i have ever read and also the only one that got to me. it would be a great experience for anybody to read this book so even if it is censored where you live, go buy it and read it anyway.      i feel the state assumes they are gonna offend people. they might not even test it anyways. they might just say its gonna offend this kinda people and thats it. how do they cokme up with it? do they let everybody read it once? no, and they should just leave it whoever doesn't read it doesnt have to or they can talk with their teacher. its not so hard to decide to censor something when its only your opinion. thats why i would look into the opinion of others.     all in all censorship shouldn't be allowed. it ruins the oppurtonity for people to read books they might find good and interesting to them. let the kids read atleast in highschool when they are all almost adults so they can read whatever they want
4 there are plenty of books that people don't want their children reading. books such as '@caps @caps @person' is a book i had read and it was very out there and straight forward. but i would have to disagree i think those books deserve to be read. it shows kids that not everything is perfect.      people complain about how they think books are bad or things people say on @caps or in music is bad but if you don't want to listen to them, don't let your kids listen to it. if parents are so worried about what kids are reading or learning because of the world we live in now, lock them up. but i do have to agree with one thing, there are alot of bad things in muic and magazines but i think it can be avoided and not be caused to crupt a kid. i'm very into music and some music i dont listen to because of the things in it but i dont let that music or magazines change my option on things. i dont think people should be able to take books of the shelfs becaue it doesnt give other students or people to read them. some people get inspired by books about drugs, not like to use them but to know that there are people out there that have overcome stitutions just like them. i like reading books about teenage problems and like to know all the different ways people have overcome them and see how they live. if people can get offended off of a book or movie i don't think they have a right to take that away. i think people that feel offended by books, magazines, and movies should stay away from them if they are offensive to them, because everyone has an option and not everyone thinks the same things.      with all the bad or good movies or books out there, i'm certain someone at least feels offended by one or two books or movies but that isn't a reason to want to take it down. because once you do that someone will take a book you thought wasn't offensive and it will make you mad. i think if people stayed away from things that offended them and stayed close to books that they liked we wouldn't have much of a conflict unless you get that picky, always wanting to start a fight person to find something else to be picky about with the books or magazines or movies
4 have you ever wondered why a movie you rented from a library when you were younger, isn't there today? this is due to censorship. libraries censor certain books if they believe them to be inappropriate for young children. should censorship be allowed in libraries? everyone has their own opinion, as do i, and i believe it should be allowed.     censoring books allows libraries to withhold books, movies, magazines, music, and more from children who are not quite mature enough to handle the contents within the material, rather it be curse words in a movie, book, or music, nudity shown in magazines, or fighting shown in a video game. young children look for role models, someone to follow, therefore, more than likely they are going to repeat what they hear or see. some children are not quite mature enough to understand that it's not alway 'okay' to repeat what you hear, some words are inapporopriate for young children. maybe they saw that on a movie, a man or woman solved a problem he or she had by fighting, the young child @month take the message the wrong way, and try and solve one of his or her problem by fighting.      i believe that an age limit should be set for certain types of materials. children that are under the age of @num should not be watching movies that are rated @caps-@num. there is a reason the rating is what it is. just because your child is not allowed to rent/check out whatever the material @month be, doesn't mean that you couldn't check it out, maybe go home and watch/listen/read/play it. if it doesn't seem to violent/graphic for your child then allow them to watch the movie, read the book, or play the game. that is your choice, but a library doesn't want to be blamed for your @num year old coming home cursing and fighting. my sister took my neice to the library once to rent a movie, it was a childrens movie, and my sister thought nothing harmful would come about it, but in one of the scenes, there was some arguing and fighting, and my neice began arguing with my sister, and hitting her, and my sister wasn't very pleased that they allowed that movie to be on the childrens floor of the library.          censorship is a wonderful thing to have in libraries. maturity level for some children is just not quite high enough for them to see/watch/listen/play certain materials. not only should censorship be allowed, it should be enforced. i believe all libraries should have to have censorship in their library
3 'hey', i believe that certain materials, such as book, music, magazines, etc., shouldn't be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive.        first, i know that people have different views appon things such as magazines, books, and music. and i also know that there are somethings that @month be offensive to you, but they aren't offensive to other perople. such as music there are all kinds of music out there. and i know that some people find rap music offensive and some doesnt. because a lot of people that doesn't find it offensive relates to it.      second, i feel that if the people that find it offensive would just ignore it then it wouldn't be a problem. because i know that maybe there is a type of magazine, book, or even a type a music that they listen to is offensive to someone else they might not find it offensive but i bet someone else finds it offensive. so for them to judge these things wouldn't be right.           third, i'm pretty sure that if something in the library was too offensive the library wouldn't have it. but maybe if we would take the time out and worry about our self instead of worrying about what's offensive and what's not then the world might be a better place. and yes i understand that people have different views but we shouldn't let that get to us.        so you can see, i believe that certain materials, such as books, music, magazines, etc., shouldn't be removed from shelves if they are found offensive. because there are billions of people on this earth and i doubt they would all give you the same answer. because so many people have different opinions, and beliefs appon things.
2 i think alot of books are good to read cause some of them will tell you more wat u didnt know so thierfore u might pick up a book that u like and read it andyou @month like it but doesnt have more meaning to  what your reading alot of books you read have some type of character in it that might talk about another thing thats opposite then what the other charcter is talking about magazines show you sometimes wat the persons life style is like some books that people read has no action or felling in it so they can just pick up and read the book its always good to pick up a reasonable  book so someone can read books thats positive and would mean something to other people to read the same book you read i think the best book is one that tells you about life and what you need to know to suceed life you @month run in to a book that is true and get into it so you can learn sometimes about what you read and write about it on a essay paper a magazine and movie book shows alot of action and wat its like what they do most people migh think its boring to read a unaction book so they get a book that they have action to so it might exsite them more than a regular book but most books have more pictures than words in it you should take a book off the shelf that has wat  you need to know about cause action books might not help you all the time the more action fun books you read are not as good as wat another book is taking place at in a stor
4 no because all people like to read different books. some of the books that people want taken off bookshelves are considered to be part of history.books help people advance in their reading skills and also help them find new things out. when i was in middle school i always liked to read @person and @person books. when i asked the librarian if they had any of their books they said no. they thought that kids in middle school shouldn't be reading books with cuss words in them and vilence. i don't think it should matter what kids read because you can't make a kid read something that he's not interested in because everybody is different all people like different types of books. theres all kinds of books like for example theres mystery books, fiction books, non-fiction books, historical books, etc. the books you use in classrooms are considered books but there not books you read everyday. i think parents should take their kids to the public library to get a book.when i was in elementry and through junior high we had to take reading tests on the computer.in seventh and eighth grade we had to sit around the room and take a book and read it for part of the hour. we also a challenge in middle school to see which school could read the most. that was part of our grade in our english class. it was never a problem for me because i loved to read.now there are some books that libraries should take off the shelves. for example any book that involves nudity or lots of vilance. now thats just for kids that are under the age of thirteen. now there isn't that many of books out there for little kids to read. theres more adult books than little kids books.all i have to say is that watch what your kids read. don't keep them from reading books because that will effect them later on in life. if they don't like to read persuade them to try it. i also think that more kids would read if they seen their relatives reading too. just remember kids and adults of all ages reading is a good thing no matter what you decide to read.
4 people today always seem like they are trying to find something offensive.  the problem with the @organization is that it always feels like it needs to appease these people.  the truth is that when you have as many as there is in a country, there are going to be many different ideas, thoughts, likes, and dislikes.     libraries are places of knowledgee.  they keep many differnt books, magazines, and movies there, so that people with all different tastes can enjoy the library.  most people, with books, figure out early what genre of books, which authors, and how long of books they like.  so books are usually very hard to offend people, because most people can usually tell right away if they like the book or not.     magazines are like books in away.  people know what they want.  with magazines though, people ususally just flip threw the pages, and skim through articles. they will keep skiming through the magazine, until they find that perfect article they want to read.  usually after that, they are done with the magazine.     music has been around almost as long as mankind has been around.  there is something about music that soothes the human body.  music is one of those things that ais constantly changing with time.  before instruments, music was just purely voice, but as the centuries went on, music became more advanced.  now it would be nice if there was just one type of music that everybody liked, but there isn't.  there are so many types of genres of music, that it would be hard to find a person in this world that liked every type of music.     there are people who hate change. likewise thet don't like to change there favorite music types.  but if people changed with time, then there would really only be a  few types of music.  but since there are many types of music, there is always going to be someone out there in the world that doesn't think that song shouldn't be played.     just in the last century movies have came along way in advancement.  movies use to be simple, they would have a simple plot, and everyone loved it.  but there are so many people who love to see technology advance, that they want movies to change.  movies today are all about special effects, love, sex, alcohol, parties, fighting, and the list could go on and on.  directores try to make the best movie possible, so its almost like they try to put just enough of one thing to keep the audience into the movie.  but if they go overboard on a subject, that is when at least one person has a red flag go up in their head and think that is offensive.     movies are suppose to be enteraaning, not something people should get offended by.  movies are good about it though.  they have created a rating system to try give the audience a fair warning heads up, so that the audience knows what to suspect in the movie.     it doesn't matter what it is, book, magazine, music or movie, there is always going to be someone who doesn't like it or is just offended by it.  there is nothing to do about that, and it's not a bad thing.  it's just simply means everyone in this world is not the same.  so i think we can all come up with the conclusion that: just because one person doesn't like something, doesn't mean the next person will
4 there are many books, music, movies, and magazines that people find offensive. some people even believe these things should be taken off the shelves. i do not believe that the books, music, movies, or magazines should be taken off the shelves completely. not everyone finds these things offensive and they should not be taken off the shelves because a few people do not agree with them.     first, people have different views on what they find offensive. not everyone will find the same things offensive or want the same books or song to be removed. with people always having different views it is difficult to take books, music, movies, or magazines off the shelves for everyone. just because one person does not agree with what is being said in the movie or book does not mean that every single person wants that movie or book to be removed. if one person found my favorite book offensive i would not want it taken off the shelves completely.      equally important, if every book, song, movie, and magazine that someone finds offensive is taken off the shelve there would not be many books, movies, songs, or magazines left. author katherine paterson once said, 'but if i have the right to remove a book from the shelf-that work i abhor-then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. and then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' @caps is saying that if every single book that offends someone is taken off the shelves there would be no books for anyone to read. people find different things offensive and if everyone took these things off the shelves there would be none left for anyone.      finally, if someone finds a book offensive they do not have to read it. when someone finds a book, movie, song, or magazine offensive they don't need to watch it or read it. instead of taking it off the shelves the person could just not read it. not everyone finds the same books offensive and taking them off the shelves could upset many people. when someone finds something offensive they could just avoid that instead of getting it removed and upsetting other people. if someone was offened by one of my favorite books, i would prefere if they just avoid reading it instead if taking it off the shelves so that i can not read it.      some people find many books, songs, movies, and magazines offensive. they would like these things to be removed from the shelves permenatly. i, however, do not believe that these things should be removed. taking these off the shelves could make some people happy, it could also upset even more. not everyone finds the same things offensive and should not be taken off the shelves because a few people do not agree with them
3 this essay is all about wether certain materials in libraries should be removed from the shelves if they are offensive to some.     i do not believe things should  be removed from shelves in libraries if they offened someone. just because it is offensive to one person doesn't mean its offensive to all . if you are offeneded by somethings they display there are ways that you can avoid seeing them. one thing you can do to avoid it is never go by or around the shelves displaying it , ask for help so you get whatever it is that you need , or try to search what your looking for on the internet.     when i visit the library i already know what im going to get so i have never found anything offensive to me. if i did find something offensive to me i would complain and if they didnt do anything about it i would just never go back. i would just research online or go to another library where i know they will meet my needs.      the libraries i go to always have sections seperating the different age groups. the sections are split into children , teens , and adults . i' ve been to the library numerous times and i have never heard anyone with a complaint about something being offensive. if the library had something that would offense me i wouldn't know. everytime i go i stay in one paticular section for teens and look at magazines and books .      i feel that if people are offended by what they see on the shelves they should just avoid or ignore it because everyone has their own opinion on what offends them and what doesn't
3 censorship in the libraries. do you think that we should be able to take movies, magizens, and books off the shelf. there are many different arguments about this subject.     i believe if they put the books, movies, and other stuff on the shelf than it should be able to be read by children and others. they need tho learn about everything thats out there in this world. because if they don't learn about this now than they will never know about all of this when they get older. i think that it is cridical for our youth to know about it.     some people @month say that we are two young to be looking at that stuff but the younger you find out about it the better of you will be when you get older.      so that is my input on the situation. the younger you are you can learn more about the stuff
3 removal of books      if there is a book that someone takes offensive, should every book similar to that book be taken of shelves?no, even though people @month find things in books offensive, they should not remove the books off shelves.      when i was in the sixth grade my teacher asked me to read and write a summary on 'a @caps @caps @caps'. i searched the whole library for the book then finally decided to ask for help, the privilage to read the book has been taking away. the book was no longer allowed in elementry schools, due to the fact parents were seeing what their children were reading and found the book very offensive. after many reports about the book, the book was taken out of the library. for me to do as my teacher asked i had to go to a public library and get the book.        if you find a book offensive keep @caps to yourself and dont read the book, they shouldnt be able to remove books just because of what people think of them. many people love different types of books, no matter if they are offensive or not others @month like them.         i believe that everyone has a right to read anything they want, books are made to be read and looked at. if books are being taking away then very less books will be read. but the more books read and understood, more books will be wrote and published.          the same has to do with music, movies, magazines, ect, they all are made for a reason and should be checked out. @caps is great to learn about different things by reading, listening, reveiwing, ect, even the things people @month find offensive, they @month teach lessons.
4 there are thousands of books in libraries, which are inapproriate and some that are. but libraries are to learn about many things such as reading for fun, reading the newsletter, or just looking for  random information. libraries are places that we refer to when we need to find historical moments, or about animals or anything else. we need all books because they teach us the past, they all have a purpose, and we become more intellegent.       i believe that all books in a library have a purpose. they @month be offensive but they teach us many things. for example, there are books out there that talk about the @caps. for some people this @month be a touchy subject and some might take it offensively, but if we didn't have those books to learn from we would make the same mistakes as we did back then. books can teach us so much about the past, we can learn so many things from books then anywhere else in the world.      i also think that all books have a purpose to them. whether they are fiction or nonfiction. you @month ask 'how do fiction books have purpose?' @caps, fiction books have a purpose because they teach us to really use our imagination, quite a bit of books make us relieze that the struggles of a character can be the same struggles of someone in real life. and the most important reason is because fiction books not only catch our attention, but they also catch our childrens attention. fiction books are the first books children know how to read, this is where they start their reading skills.      my last reason for why i don't think 'offensive' books shouldn't be removed from shelves is because all books make us more intellegent. we learn so much information from all sorts of books. another example would be, that @caps books could be 'offensive' as @caps, but if we didn't have them we would not have intellegent doctors. my final reason why i disagree with books being removed if they aren't suited for everyone is that someone that wants to learn something wouldn't be able to because what they want to learn could be offensive to others. what i mean by this is that we would pretty much be telling that person that they are not able to learn something new because others think it's offensive.     every human being has a different outlook on something that could be offensive or could not. but why should we remove books, magazines, movies, etc from shelves? just because we don't like it doesn't mean we have to remove it. everyone has different taste, we wont ever agree on anything. but removing books from shelves isn't fair to anyone. yes, they @month be unsuited for others but when we don't like some thing don't we just move along to something we do like? yes we do, so we should do the same thing with books
2 to me that is not good to take some music or book to be  removed becuase that is not cool to do that becuase people read or sing what they feel most of the time. that is what people mose do they rend or sing what they feel about in waht they feel in there body that is what  i thing that they should  not removed they music or book, movies. you are going to remove people tallens i do thing that is ok to do that to those people they work haren to do wan they like in just be the thing they say or dowen you are go to remove there tallen no. the people that do like that than do lessn to it or see just shanjet to something more than that. you know that is bad to remove there musics and books because you wall remove there carenos to not just @num thing you will remove more than what you thing. you just make gtham lusen averthing to that is wan they like or love to sing or dowe there books of wan they think that is more than at book or song to them.      i say no becuase that is what they like to do in if you do like it than just do hare just shanjet than instad of makeing a big delown to them in make there life mesoper by harening poeple takeing of them of wan they sing or rending
4 everyone likes to watch movies, jam to some music, and get lost in an interesting book. therefore everyone should be able to read, watch, or listen to what they want and the same things as other people are reading, listening to, and watching. some things are needed to look up or look at if one is doing a project. other people just @month be entertained by certain peices of liturature, or music. in that case, why censor certain things that people are interested in, or even things to research, in libraries?     many people enjoy violent writing or gorey movies. reading these things also amusses them. so why take away what they like? if a library takes certain books off of their shelves, then they could be taking away a type of literature that people are interested in. if one removes a book that twenty people take pleasure in reading, then thats twenty people that are not going to want to read anything else. people are different in many ways. that includes the variety of things humans are interested in. for example, things they are interested to read. humans having a major differences in characteristics, meaning they don't enjoy all the same things. the articles, magazines, or movies @month be not suited for schools or libraries, but if it's a topic people like, or if it's someone needs for a project, then there is no reason to get rid of it.     some books offten offend certain groups or races of people, but the book gets it uniqueness from what it says. some books are writen in times of racisim. this shuold'nt make a book worth critisizing because that was the way things were said in that time. it allows the book to give off a feeling of living in the time is based in. on the other hand, some magazines are writen about horrible events and wars, but people find entertainment in reading about these events going on in the world. they want to know what is really happening across seas or even around home. someone isn't able to know what's happening is no one lets him or her read the magazine.     authors and writers write these things for the entertainment of people who want to read them. due to the wide veriety of interest people have, there are many different types of writings. people should'nt have their favorite book taken off shelves just to see that the guy right next to him found the book he loves. that just would'nt be fare. libraries should put on the shelf what people write, so that others @month enjoy them.
4 censorship helps prevent people from viewing, listening, or read disturbing images or ideas for certain age groups. but in the case of libraries, all the books would have to be taken off the shelves. and if all the books are taken off the shelves, then all the books in stores would have to be thrown out as well.     books are essential part of life. they have great ideas and thoughts expressed through these amazing pieces of word art. people who think that the books in libraries should be censored, are fools. these people want to keep their children and themselves safe, and that is understandable, but at the same time they are hurting people with the decision they have decided to put forth. authors are hurt because it is their work that is being censored. people who enjoy reading the books, that are wanted censored, would no longer be able to read those books.     it is mainly the choice of the person to avoid these books if they truely find it offensive to themselves. they should not go all out of their way and try to censor them, because they would eventually might cause everyone or some people to think that they could find a book that should be censored. and if that happens, then there would be no more books on the shelves. the government will take notice and ban these books or worse remove all books forever just like what happened in @caps @num.     over all, books are a good thing. they gives us inspiration, and help us pull through life with the thoughts expressed in them. it is your choice to avoid the books that upset you, not what other people think about them.
2 censorship in libraries     i think that censorship in a library is fine some people @month feel that children don't need to see certain things. which that @month be true there are a lot of things that even adult shouldn't even see themselves. if there is going to be bad things in the library the owners might make a section just for those things.      people should have the right to be able to look at anything that they want in the library
3 dear newspaper,     i don't think there should be censorship at all. everyone has the right to read or watch whatever makes them happy. just because someone is offended by them doesn't mean it shouldnt exist. maybe if you were to take books and movies off the shelfs for censory that alone would offend someone? it would offend the person who wrote the book or made the movie.      there are many reasons why censory shouldnt be in libraries. my first reason is freedom of speech. people have the right to say or write whatever they believe. just because it can offend someone doesnt mean you should take the opportunity to read away from the people it doesn't offend. give people the full right to read and write whatever it is they want to.     also if you use censorship then it's going to effect literature in a bad way. by using censorship you will have to take the books that offend people off the shelves. not having these books up on the shelves, means no one can read them. if no one can read the books, no one learns.     one more thing to take into consideration, is the authors money. alot of times in the library if i see a book i really like, i'll go buy it. but taking these books off the shelves means no one will see them. the author's write these books so they can make a point and make money. if we take the books down, they dont make money and they dont make their intended point.     in conclution i think censory is overall a bad idea. one because of freedom of speech. second is it could possibly drastically effect literature. third is its taking away authors money and point of view. these are the important reasons i do not surrport censory.
4 should certain books and magazines be removed from the shelves if found offensive ? yes! children shouldnt be exposed to certain things. some books and magazines are to explict for children at certain ages. children should read books that meet their age group. if children read books that are inapporiate for their age they might start to act out that way. parents should try and remove all books that are offense to their children because that can have a real bad affect on them. children at a certain age group should read books thats on their level and apporiate for them.          certain books, magazines, music, and movies are to explict for kids these days. i think they should all be blocked and out of children reach. if children started to listen inapporiate music and read offense books it might affect the way they act. children shouldnt be exposed to things that might brain wash them. if kids start toread horrible book and listen to bad music imagine what affect it might have on them in the world we live in today!     i think parents should try and do all they can to keep certain things out of the reach of their children. parents should protest and call meetings to make sure libraries are taking inapporiate things off the shelves for kids. parents should want to keep kids far away form certain things that @month appear offense. it will mean that they'll doing their job as a good parent.      sometimes kids wont always agree with what the parent might say but they hav to realize it could be whats best for them. parents shouldn't always want to be their child friend because, sometimes kids would run over you. i know from personal exprience because sometimes peoplecan take kindness for weakness! being a parent you should already be prepared for things like this.     in conclusion explict magazines, books, and music should really be taken off the shelves from kids. it might expose children somethings that isnt always good for them
3 in this article i am going to talk about the way libraries sensor their books. i am going to hit points on what i think about the subject. but also give what point of view i feel about the books that are on these shelves. also on the way libraries should handle this matter by pre-sensoring the books on the shelves. i will try to give details on why it does not or if it has to be taken off the shelf.     i think that certain materials should not be a problem if the librarians can keep a closer eye on what their reading. but it can be stopped by just looking at the review and seeing if this is a good enough book for your child to read. this can be a problem in some ways if kids are exposed to this material that they are reading. but some children can take some of this stuff the wrong way when they are reading a mature type book. but you just can not for get about those books, you have to watch what they are reading.     some ways that they handle this problem can get a little extreme. if you take a book off the shelf what is the older person going to read. you just can't do this because what if another persons wants that book and they can not have it. but what you can do is make a special section for those types of books young children will not get those books. this i think can help with the problem.     i feel that they could also pre-sensor these books. this will help explain things in a way they can understand it. plus it can improve the way people feel about them books. but also they print two copies one for a more mature audiance and one for a younger one. if they do this it would make an improvement so younger kids can take this information lke a mature person does and say this is not real life.     in @caps conclusion i feel like i am nuatral about the subject. i think it is a bad thing to have them on the shelf in a library. but i feell it can be prevented in the way libraries run it. just keep a closer eye the younger audiance. also to try and pre-sensor them to make them more friendly to the younger audiance
3 they will see it eventually. there is no reason to censor a library, i believe. i think they should be sectioned off, maybe put the 'offensive' books in the back  of the libarary is enough censorship. you have to look at it in the publishers view also. they want to sell and advertise their product and they have a right to do so. libraries shouldn't take their product off the shelves just because someone stumbled apon something they believe is offensive.          we all know what offensive things we could find in a library or a bookstore like @organization. things that show innaproperate pictures, drugs, firearms..ect. i believe they are already censored enough. most of magazines that many people find 'offensive' are always put in the back of the store or secetioned off so people don't stumble upon it or have their childern flipping threw the pages corrupting their minds. some material are even put in a plastic sleve so the person must puchase it before reading.          if you decide to write and publish a book, don't you think you should be given the right as everyone else to put it on the shelves and promote it? i do, there is no reason why you shouldn't be able to. the library shouldn't censor your book just because someone else thinks and feels it's offensive. that's not fair in @location. i think that the libraries shouldn't censor any materials. offensive or not we have the write to publish and promote it
5 a colossal number of significant and life-changing books can be found in the millions of libraries throughout the world. the big question is whether or not individuals should get rid of the books of lesser importance, and the books that are found offensive to a number of people. in my opinion, there are a certain number of books wasting away on the shelves of the library that need to be disposed of. that is why libraries need to discover which books are creating issues, such as books on race or religion. although katherine paterson boldly argues against taking books off of the shelves, i strongly disagree and believe that libraries should remove materials that are creating tension or books wasting away on the shelves.     race is an extremely important topic in the world today, and i believe books that discrimate against certain ethnicity's need to be removed immediately from libraries. @caps, there are exceptions to this proposal. for instance, books talking about the civil war and underground railroad need to be kept in libraries because they are significant historical events. unlike fantastic books about our nation's history, there are also books about race that are of lesser importance, and they @month offend people. in that case, libraries need to crack down on this issue and remove offensive books from the shelves!     secondly, libraries need to be extremely cautious about what music is made available to the public. it is important that we teach our children the difference between right and wrong at a young age, and if the kids hear some of the derogatory music on the shelves, they will lose all sense of what is right and wrong. as katherine paterson mentions in her quote,' all of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.' @caps, that same quote can easily apply to the music on display in the libraries.  by libraries exposing children to derogatory music, they are creating enormous liabilities for the children and their families. overall, our society would benefit greatly if libraries removed derogatory and offensive music.     lastly, katherine paterson says that if we keep removing offensive books from the shelves, there will be 'no books left on the shelf for any of us.' @caps, that is a nieve comment as @caps as an exaggeration. there are millions of libraries throughout the world and thousands of items in each of those libraries. therefore, it would benefit our society if we would dispose of the items creating the greatest amount of tension, and there is one simple but effective way of doing that. when people are at the check out desk at the library, the library could have a sheet of paper asking if the customer found a certain book offensive. if the same item appears regularly on the list, remove the item. that would benefit everybody greatly because the offensive items would no longer be on the shelves, and it takes little effort from all parties involved.     in conclusion, i oppose katherine paterson's decision and believe libraries should remove offensive materials immediately. one highly controversial topic is race, and if the book is not informing us about a historical event, it should be removed. certain derogatory and offensive music is available in libraries, and it should be removed from the shelves as @caps. a quick and efficient way of figuring out which books are offensive is to have a list available to the public where they can write down which book they find offensive. ultimately, libraries need to take action and dispose of the offensive materials that pose a threat to our society
4 how would you feel if you were forced to only enjoy the exact things that everyone else enjoys? if you were limited to only certain subjects because all of the other choices were thrown out you might begin to feel trapped. everyone in this world is different from the next person. so i believe that each person should be able to read any book they would like without any restrictions. some reasons for my opinion are personal values, unique interests, and the fact that people should have a right to read the books that they like without judgement from others.     for my first reason goes along with personal values. for example a person of higher authority @month find a particular book, magazine, or movie inappropriate due to their values and beliefs. so if this person is the owner of the library they would be able to throw out all books and movies pertaining to that topic. this would make it unfair for the people who do enjoy these topics.      my next reason is that every single person has their own unique interests. if someone begins to dispose of books that they are not interested in the library will lose all of the visitors that do find that topic enjoyable. this can cause the library problems and be a disappointment to those who find reading about that certain topic a great way to pass time. everyone likes different things and has different views. they should not be forced to read only the things that are selected by another person.     people should also have a right to read the books that they like without judgement from others. i know from experience that being ostracized for doing what you enjoy is completely unfair. if everyone did the things that every other person does our world would not accomplish anything out of the ordinary. many people find inspiration from books and movies so if these were limited to only particular subjects people would begin to feel pressured to be the same. every person should have a right to enjoy the things that make them happy without being hurt by the opinions and judgements of others.     books should be something that each person should have a choice in. if there are endless choices of books and movies a person could learn about many different things and develope a more open mind. if everyone in this world opened their mind people would become more accepting of others. so i believe anything that is published should be there for the public to read. no one should be limited because of other people's values or interest. the right to read the books, magazines, and watch the movies you like should always be present.
5 i believe that censorship is rarely acceptable, and certainly not in libraries, at school or otherwise. censorship prevents knowledge from being obtained, spreading ignorance and intollerance. libraries and schools are meant to be places that encourage free thinking, discovery, and learning. censorship stops these things from occuring.     if people are prevented from reading what they want, then many will not read, period. not all children and teens are drawn to reading. if there is a book that a reluctent reader shows interest in, then why would someone want to take it away? because @caps or she finds it offensive? because @caps or she does not agree with the views expressed? neither are legitimate reasons for censorship.      most justifications for censorship would not stand the test of time. a great number of books challenged in the past are today considered classics and/or important works, such as to @caps a @caps, @organization, the @caps of @organization, and @caps @caps @person. to @caps a @caps and @person were censored because of the racist language. @caps language helps to set the time period in the novels. also, to @caps a @caps is about a lawyer who defends a wrongly accused black man in @location. the main antagonist is an ignorant, rascist man. the book itself is not racist, only the villian of the story.     censorship for such reasons is different than not allowing a young child to watch something violent. preventing a child from seeing a rated @caps@number movie or reading a letter to @organization is a separate issue from censorship. i define censorship as preventing someone from seeing or reading something due to personal views rather than for the good of the sheltered person. keep children sheltered when they are young, if one must, but as they grow older and mature, it is essential that they are allowed to mature in their reading, as well.     if someone lives their life reading only the books others choose for him or her and seeing only the movies and shows chosen for him or her, then @caps or she will not be his or her own person. living a sheltered life can catch up to people when they reach adulthood. they will not have their own views, and will be largely ignorant to the world around them. @person said, '@caps who destroys a good book, kills reason itself.' @caps is what happens to people who have grown up among censorship; they have very little reason. censorship can mold people, not for the better. people who grow up free to read and watch generally what they wish can turn out differently.     these people can have views and values of their own, formed by, among other factors, influential books they have read throughout their life. many of these people better understand others, promoting tolerance. censorship takes away all of those wonderful qualities from people. anyone is capable of possessing them.      censorship cannot be seen as the norm. libraries and schools should allow children and teenagers to learn and grow.that is the purpose of the institution of education. therfore, censorship should not even be considered. students' freedom to read what they desire should be the policy of all schools and libraries
3 nearly every person has seen, heard, wrote, or said something that offended someone. most of the people that offened others do it on perpose in there music, books, or movies. while some other people accdeltly offened people by the way the worded somedthing. if someone finds something offensive, they should ask for it to be placed somewhere else so it is still avaible, ask for a vote to remove it from the shelves, or just keep it to themselves until they know their not to only one offeneded.     when someone gets offened by something they see and hear in a library, that person should ask for relocation for the offensive meteral they seen or heared. in this case, other people can still watch, hear, or read the book or magazine, movie, or music. just because something is offensive to one person does not mean it is to someone else.     a book or magazine, song, or movie could be offensive to a lot of people, so it should be voted to be removed or stay in the labrary. this way the materal has a chance to be avaible in the future. some music and movies could get removed then replaced with the censered version so it for the people that were not offened.     in some cases there is only one person that got offeneded by something that was in a library. in these cases the person could chose to wait to until someone else is offeneded by the materal to speek up about it's offensiveness.     if materal is offensive to someone they should get it relocated, voted on, or hold their peace. if relocated the materal is still avaible to other people. when voted one it could stay or be removed. someone can speek up about the offensive materal after someone else find it offensive as well.
3 i think that that if there is a book in the libraries that is hurmful. then you should  have to be at least @num years of age to check it out. the reason why i say @num is because at that age you should know whats right or wrong and you can handle it if is wrong. i mean if you know its wrong then dont read it no one is maken you read it.     it would be differnt if some one waz but no one is.some people like to read differnt kinds of books just because its not right and hurts you dont mean it hurts ever one it @month make it helpfull to some one esle and if its tgaken out then there wont be any books in the libraries for anyone to check out and read. because ever book in there is going to hurt some if u made them read it.     if you have have a problem with that you can contact me at @num ask for @person and we can talk bout it and mabe you @month be about to change my mind or after you read this you make think the same way as i do.      the reason i feel thinks way is because like i said before there is a part in ever book that will hurt some one so you should have to be @num to check out surten books.if ur getting hurt by a bunch of books then i would sugest you to stop readen because a book is a book not somthing to hurt you.there is so many people in the world that is into books and resourcen bout stuff.     what i do not agree with is that kids getting out of class going to the library playing games and putting puzzels togther that is the problem  i got.i mean yeah people do go in there and do work witch is find but some say that they have work and they dont.they just want to get out of class and not do work. people go in there and play games and when people need on the cumputer there is no were to go because of kids playing games.          but as the book part in the library i dont have a problem with that  thats what i got to say bout books hurting people is dont read them other people  like them being there for them.
4 it has been brought to my attention by some members of my community that the local library is planning to remove some materials such as our books, movies, and music. i've confronted them and they've made no such such effort as to amend the censorship that has already taken place. i understand that some works @month be found offensive to some audiences, but i believe all people should have access to the knowedge they wish to acquire.     these works they wish to condemn and banish are works of passion and labor. what i've noticed is, the materials they view as compremising are some of the most passionate, heartfelt labors of expression; and i firmly believe this removal act hurts more than those that are banished. this denies those artists of their own freedom of expression and represses something simple, our own expression.     the capibilities of the human mind are limitless, but yet those who display it's functions are limited. knowledge is the key to unlocking a much more vast understanding of the world around us and i believe this censorship highlights what i attempt to depict in my own exposition of our minds. i believe we have come very far in the evolution of our liturature and i would hate to see the flame of inspiration for creation snuffed out in a modest dash. just out of a few broken heartstrings? or a spare tear lost upon the earth, dusted by some ignorance forsaken, missunderstood language doomed to be lost; out of a loss of understanding? i think not.      in conclusion, i've noted what i wish to converse and i firmly stand against this censorship. i'm only one voice, but this is a call to arms and i believe we can accomplish great things together. so let's get the word out and defeat this repression of expression
4 a library is a place to rent books, music, movies, etc., that you don't have at your home. some people go to a library to use the computer for a project, or to check out books, musical materials, movies, etc. @caps isn't a bad thing if the library has materials that are offensive to some people. if people don't want to see material that will offend them then they shouldn't go to the are in the library that contains the offensive materials.      in my own personal opinion, @caps doesn't really apply to me if there is offensive material in the library. if there is going to be offensive material in a library then you should be a certain age to rent @caps or read @caps. not just anyone should be able to walk into the library and check out these offensive materials. if someone that is under this age tries to check out this material, then they shouldn't be aloud to have them.     another opinion of mine on this subject, is if these kinds of material offend someone then they could not go to that area of the library. instead the person can go around this section of the library or they could not pay attention to the materials. the library could make a certain part of the library made just for these kinds of material, so that people nor children have to see them.      also, if a child wants to see these kinds of materials then they could find another way to see them. they don't necessarily have to go to the library to find these kinds of things. if a child wants to do something badly enough then they will find a way to do @caps, or in this case the child will see something that they want to see.        if parents don't like these kinds of materials in the library then they should teach their children not to look at these kinds of materials, if they catch their children looking at materials that are offensive then they should punish their child and let them know that they shouldn't look at those kinds of materials. a library shouldn't have to take off their books, music, magazines, etc., just to satify parents.      if the library took these kinds of materials off of their shelves then they would lose business. so in theory, libraries should not have to take their materials off of their shelves just to satisfy parents. libraries need money so that they can buy new materials and without customers they have no money which enables them unable to buy new materials. so parents should keep track of what their kids check out at the library. offensive materials should not be taken out of libraries, these kind of materials should just have rules.
4 i believe that everyone should be free to read, listen or watch what they choose to. anything publically exposed is goin to be seen anyhow. i think it shall be up to that person if they want to read something to mature or @organization for themself. if it is a child i think the parent shall be in charge of that decision not the libarian.     books, movies, and music are forms of entertainment. people read @organization material to entertain themselves, and there is nothing wrong with entertainment. everyone loves entertainment but to put a limit on it is unfair. if it is public that mean it should be released under certin circomstances or age, and maturity. regaurdless of in a book or magazine everything that you dont want people to see will always show up somewere else, such as the tv or the internet.     the public library is were people go to get books to larn more about something so if u yake that book off the shelve someone might miss out on on  education about somthing. i wouldn't take any book off the shelf because it was put there to read, and it might be a good thing that child gets that book so that they have knowledge about somethings that are out there. if its there to read then let it be read instead of hiding it from them it only makes children more anxious to read or see it.        if its in a public library let it be read people and children shall be free to anything in the library unless other wise consented by a parent. anything publically exposed in a book, magazine or movie will be shown on the internet or tv so children will see what they want  rather elders' agree to it or not. nudity, perfanity, violence, and provocative materialare in everything now days even cartoons so there is no way of kepping it from children or people its apart of everyday livng.
3 i feel that it should be censorship in libraries.children shouldnt be able to go to the library and see certain books if they aren't supposed to.this could save people from getting in trouble and reading thye wrong stuff.     there should be censorship in libraries.i feel that it should be censorship because they already have stores that contain certain things that kids aren't able to buy.one other reason that i feel that it should be censorship is because children will probably read something and take it the wromg way.when you are a kid and you know that there is something that you know for sure you shouldnt be reading or watching,you try your best to sneak and read or watch whatever it @month be.thats why if we had censorship,they wouldnt have a chane to do so.another reason i say we should have censorship is because libraries are public, and if you have to be a certain age to look at or view something then you should nt have it in the library.     as you can see,these are the reasons that i feel we should have censorship in libraries.with censorship nobody will feel left out and everyone will be treated equally and feel the same.they already have book stores and online site, where u can buy books and movies,and they have no censorship u just have to be a certain age and have a credit card.that way, they are for sure it is okay for you to rent things from them because you have to be a certain age to have a credit card.so with that being said,i feel there should be censorship in libraries.
4 dear @caps,     @caps is it safe to draw the line on what kids should or should not see as far as the world is concerned. what makes kids behave better, being sheltered from life or being life smart and knowing what is going on in this world.      i think its safe to say what we do or do not want our kids to do, say ect. but in other terms do we have full conrol of our kids @num. i knw that this might sound wierd but i strongly believe in the simple fact hat kids are being over sheltered to day! our kids are groing up with the new technology. its the centry for computers and laptops and gaming systems. our kids dont know what its like to go out side anymore. the world has so much to offer us yet, we turn it down beacuse we see what all the new advances have to offer as well. i think it is very important to be books smart as well as street smart, if you spend all your @caps doing one thing at at @caps you are gonna end up lacking on one thing. i blelieve grades will come.     i think that our kids are over sheletered for the simple fact that when our kids see something that we dont want them to see, or there not ready for then there not allowed to see it it, but whos to say on the days your not watching them that there not going to go in the real world and just see exactly what you didnt want them too! this is why its important for you to teachyour child what is going on in the world and noth leave them in the dark.     also we are living in the new age of life, were computers and laptops are the number one thing in the world right now for people to be usign and on throught the day. it is hard for kids to understand the realness of life since ever thing is done over the internet now. it is a privilage to be so far advanced in the world yet we still dont know what to do!      as we get older we are not gonna know nearly as much stuff as need to be known and taught beacuse as we get older were gettomg, more logic and more information over the materials on the web. kids will not know how to fix cars or know to start up a lawm mower.      i think that books should not be taken off te shelf beacuse as the day goes by kids reality is getting taken and taken more and more! i think that it is a big deal what kids learn about the everyday life becuse that is our future and if they have no idea what is going on and it scares me beacuse the are going to be alot more battles for our kids to fight we just have to teach them all that we can and hope that they become the best people they can be in life !                                                 thank you for your @caps!                                                            deven
3 when ever has a few bad things being said ever effected how or what people read @caps a days. that's what is hot in this present lifetime. no one wants to read a boring article, not unless it's meant to be. i'm going to share with you my opinions on certain materials, such as books, music, magazines, ect.,should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. i have observations, experience, and reading some of my the articles that were called offensive to prove my opinions.     in my opinion, no ones work should be taken off of a shelf due to any thing, because i'm sure they worked on it an awful lot for it to be placed on a shelf. so there is no reason for it to be taken off. if that was my stuff that had got took off the shelves i would be shocked and upset. so that is one reason why you shouldn't do that. it could hurt people emotionly.     following that statement, but there can be times where you just don't want them to be seen because they are to embarrassing. such as an athlete interviewed in an @caps article, that got suspended from their sport due to violations, and this athlete is just cursing and being out of control. i would put that article away also, just so the public won't see it and no one is put on blast.     finally, @caps everyone knows that some types of movies, and music can't be put on display in public. so you would have to ask for the movie or @caps and someone will go get it from the back for you, due to explicit content or explicit lyrics. g-@caps @num, should be the only movies allowed on shelves, rated @caps and up should be behind counter, and the same with music. i am pretty sure that is clear with this audience.     @caps that i have shared with you my opinions on different views on censorship in libbraries what is you thoughts on this topic as you read this persuasive essay. you have read my thoughts on experience, observations, and just common sense on this topice. if you had to write an essay on censorship in libraries, how would you come about this.
3 should materials that are offensive be taken off shelves?should movies you loved and use to watch when you were a kid be gone in a instant?     magazines are offensive, they always have been, they get the truth out of celebrities and people and they twist their words into something totally different from what they said. there are tons of movies in this world that will show harm to people, replay a bad part of somebodys life, say things about people.music is just words and sound, they make songs about people that have done stuff in the past , that people would find offensive. i have seen a music video about @person and making fun of her being in jail, but do i think that should be taken off the computer, no its entertaining.this world needs something to keep us intertained. imagine what it would be like if we had no news reporters, no paparazzi. we wouldnt know anything going on around the world, and seeing the things about celebrities that they would find offensive, i can understand where they are coming from, getting talked about all the time, especialy about mistakes you have made in your lives, but thats how the world functions, thats always going to be apart of everyones lives,talk.     so as i have been saying, getting rid of movies,music,magazines,books that are offensive would not be a good choice in my opinion, cause what would entertain us if they were gone?
4 in most libraries in the @location, there are certain books, movies, music, etc., that could be inappropriate to younger children.  these books and movies can contain graphic content or offensive language that any young child should not be hearing or seeing.  however, this does not mean that the libraries of @location should get rid of these books, videos, etc.  the libraries should keep these books and videos because the adults of @location like to use them, the kids probably already know about the language and graphic content, and some of the books and movies that are offensive are very educational.     when you think about your childhood, there would always be things you couldn't watch or listen to because you were to young.  your @caps and @caps would watch movies that you couldn't watch because they would say you aren't old enough.  they enjoy watching more mature movies because it is more interesting to them than cartoon shows or movies.  the mature content in movies, books, and more should be kept in libraries because mature audiences enjoy watching and listening to them.  if they are taken out of libraries, this mature audience has nothing to watch or read in the library.  they do not want to be reading children's books all the time.     also, most children have already observed or heard this offensive content in these books and movies.  most of the parents in the @location have used offensive language infront of their child without even realizing it.  the kid then starts using these words because they think they are cool if @caps and @caps use them.  another thing is that most kids have seen a movie with graphic content in it, or they have played a video game with it in the game.  they have seen blood, gore, and other things in these games and movies.  it's already too late to try and hide your child from seeing or hearing these 'bad words' or 'graphic content'.     many movies and books that contain offensive language and graphic content are very good and educational videos.  for example, '@caps @caps @caps' was a great movie describing the search for one man in the middle of @caps @caps @num.  these wars actually occured and movies like this give a great amount of detail on what actually went on during these wars.  if you want kids to know about the history of our country, they need to know what actually happened.  there is no point in trying to hide the truth.     overall, most kids in the @location have heard offensive language or graphic content.  whether it was from a parent or even their best friend, they have heard it.  so why woyld we try to hide this from them? keep these books, movies, music, and more in the libraries for the benefits of the adults, the kids, and for the history of the country.
4 would you let someone ban your favorite movie, just because it has mildly offensive materials in it? i know i would not.  if everyone had the right to ban books then we would have no books, because something would offend someone. you should not ban books because it desecrates our individuality , we have the freedom of press, and because it would ruin the future.      if you ban a book then you are giving up your indiviuality. if you let someone decide what is offesive to you, then how can you express yourself. therefore, by letting someone else decide what is appropriate for you to read, you are giving up your freedom. by banning books, you are not being yourself you are conforming to what other people want. therefore, you should not ban books because, it demolishes your individuality, and it makes you conform to what other people want.      there should not be any banning of books. you should not be able to ban books because we have the freedom of press. the freedom of press means that we can write whatever we want. however, you should not ban books because we have the freedom to choose what we read. this means that we as individuals should be able to decide what we want to read and what we do not. you should not ban books because we have the freedom of press, and because we have the freedom as individuals to read what we want.     if you ban books then you will ruin the future. there are hundreds of really phenomenal books out there that would be banned, and future people would not be able to enjoy them.  there are books that can change your life, and teach you how to deal with things, and  if we ban them then we are ruining the chance to help future people with their problems. people turn to books for knowledge, and help, and for ideas, and if we take away their books then how can we say that we are paving the way for the future if we are destroying it along the way. books should not be banned because if they were then, we would be ruining the future for others, and we would be destroying our own future.     in conclusion, books should not be banned because, it limits our individuality, we have the freedom of press, and because it destroys our future. if you ban books , more likely than not, your favorite book would get banned. also, if everyone could ban books, then there would be nothing to read because all of the books would be banned. by banning books you are destroying the future, limiting our freedoms, and abolishing our indivuality.
2 first of all i believe if its on the shelf you should be able to get it, no matter what your age is. yeah theirs thing's that shouldn't be on the shelf, but how are kids and people supposed to know to get that or not. if kids arnt alowed to get certant material on the shelfs, then it shouldn't be their, @caps my oppinion.     parents @month think differnt, parents might think only certant things should b alowed at a libray. @caps not their choice though. anything is alowed to be at a libray. if you dont want your kid reading or getting certant thing's, then when your kid goes to the libray go with them. help them pick out a book.     in conclusion i believe you should be able to check anything that is on the shelf. kid or if your an adult. if your not alowed to get, then why is it their? i dont know i couldnt anwser that question, other than why is it their? @caps my oppinion though
2 as an individual and what books i have read, i believe some books needs to be taken off the shelf. my concern is for the children who get a hold of these books. kids should be kids and wait till they're older and more mature to know about certain things. this also includes music, movies, and magazines. some people believe these things influence bad behavior like stealing, cussing, and even murder. the less obsene matterial we have the better we can control our kids or at least some of them anyway.         we see bad behavior every day like stealing, cussing, murder, and assault. ever wonder what causes people to do it? just look around you they show it in movies, they talk about it in books. theres even songs about it, no wonder kids think its okay to do these kind of things! if we limit these items we @month see positive results.     like i said before kids should be kids and be free of these obsene materials. they will be exposed to it sometime but hopefully when they're older. in the mean time censors should be put on these items or taken off the shelf.
3 isn't there a saying in the world called its a free country? i thought it wasthere are alot of things that people should not see in the world. but we find ways to see it anyway no matter what it is the world has so many sources to get the truth or maybe even lie's to the world we live in. from the media to the press to poparasi maybe even from the people around you they all help the cause of things that should not be being seen by the people.          there thing's out there that we the people don't know nothing about that the goverment and world shields from our eyes. then there's the things that we are showin by the world like @person alot of people think what happend to him is offensive. not only that but racisim in general also the news why would people put violent things on the news like murder storys and kidnapping and robberys and many more. people find that offensive and even scary to alot of people but yet we keep it on there.                                                                  so no i don't think it should not be removed from shelves and or were ever all things found to be offensive to people are located. just like when that marine died and gay supportors and protestors were near his funeral chanting with (offensive) thing's. say thank god for dead soldiers and god hates the army. nobody stopped that. if we as people are not going to come togeather and work with one another about the things that should or should not be displayed then whats the point of telling someone else what is offensive to you when your going to end up doing it to. and your going to do it with out a care in the world not thinking about who your hurting . everyone has and opinion and wants to demained it but people are diffrent and some will always see it diffrent than what you see it.                                                       so if you see something offensive in a book or movie or outside. dont watch it dont read it dont try to hear about it from a friend or stranger leave it alone. we put so much effort into hearing about these offensive things when all you had to do was leave it alone. and then you wouldnt have even known about it. live life and dont worry about the negative lets focus on the positive of what you see.
4 libraries are full of all different sorts of books, movies and magazines.  these books, movies, and magazines @month come across as offensive to some people. parents might not want their children to see certain books or movies. does this mean we should take thoughs offensive books off the shelf?      if everyone decided to take one book or movie they think was inappropriate off the shelf, there would be nothing left in the library. books contain adventures and life lessons that kids and adults need. young children need books to help their imagination grow.  if there was not anymore books in the library, children would not be able to learn or grow. movies are just like books but for young children it is easier to visualize a movie rather then a book. if the book or movie is found offensive to you, pick another, but it should not be removed from the shelf.  one book or movie @month seem offensive to you, but @month not to another person.     a world without books. no imagination. no adventures. it would be a boring world.  i would rather have a few offensive books then none at all. that way i can learn and see character's adventures through my own eyes
4 magazines and books     i am writing an essay on should we take books, magazines, or movies off the shelves if they have bad language or have violant roles in it.     first thing we should discover is how many people like books, movies, or music like that. @caps me personally like books that have violance and graphic language in them @caps that just makes the book so much more interesting. and when it comes to music their parents need to be very careful what they let their kids listen to. and @caps boadcasters need to watch what they put on the air @caps some of it can be pretty bad for a kid to watch.      the second thing is, is it ok for kids to be reading these kind of books. i dont think it would be ok for a kid under fourteen to be reading about violance or hearing words that are graphic. but its not up to me they need to take a survey on the moms and dads of these children and see what they think about it. @caps it is up to them if they want there kid listening to or reading material like that.     and its also up to the childrens parents what kind of music they listen to. @caps there is more cerse words in the @date than there has ever been in the history of music and the same goes for books and magazies. magazines sometimes can be pretty graphic when it comes to picures.me myself dont really look at magazines @caps they dont really intrest me i would rather sit down and watch what ever it is on @caps.     then the third and final argument is how could we make our libraries in american more censored for kids. i think the libraries shoul have different rooms that have different types of book in them. @caps if you just have a library that anybody can go and pick up any book that they wanted then kids are going to go straight to the funny books or the books that are not suitable for kids to be reading. they should make it so you have to be a certain age to check out a book that has bad language or that has graphis pictures or that just are not suitable for children.      that is why i think that books need to get into the right hands and not into kids hands. kids dont need to know bad language at their age @caps that is a bad habit for a kid to learn then they will go to school saying them. and reading books that talk about beating somebody up or murder mikght get it in a little kids head that that is ok. and that is not ok with me
4 there are many opinions on censorship in libraries. some people believe that if books are offensive in any way that they should be removed, while other believe that these books should stay since there are different opinions on what is classified as 'offensive'. i believe that books should remain on shelves due to the fact that all people view things differently and its free will that allows people to pick up these books. no one if forcing them to read them.      i believe when books, music, movies, and magazines publish offensive material that it is just a matter of opinion. i feel that people have different perspectives on what they find appropriate. for example, a magazine article containing information about the wrong doings of the political offices or a cartoon of a certain candidate. some poliliticians might find this article offensive and take it as a jab towards them while others see it just as an opinion on the matter. another example would be a book on religious purposes. for instance, a book on an @caps religion. some @caps might take it as offensive if the informations paints them as being a certatin stereotype, but others @month see it as educational learning.      i also feel like this somewhat goes along with the idea of free will. no one can force a person to not read a certain book or listen to a certain song. it's free will that allows us to read, listen, and watch whatever pleases us. i feel that if someone was to go and demand that we take a book off a shelf that takes away from a person's free will who @month be coming to rent the book that day. its up to an individual to decide on what they will read and what their take is on the matter.      i also feel that these types of media should remain on the shelves because of learning and educational purposes. i believe that even though some of these books or movies might have a couple of offensive lines or phrases that does not mean the whole thing is offensive. i think that the library is a place where people can go and research information. some of the material found @month be offensive to a certain person but that does not cancel out the rest of the book and mark it as being 'wrong'. i think that we must decide on what we believe is right in books and tune out what we feel is offensive or else many informational books would not be available today.      the library is a place where our free will comes into play. i feel that the offensiveness in books, music, movies, and magazines are all based on personal opinions and that they should never be removed from libraries. these books all contain information that could be veiwed in different ways and that it is up to the public to decifer for themselves what is offensive and what is acceptable. i believe that no one should decide for us
4 in my experience some music is just too offensive.  they use words that should not be heard by certain people and especially certain ages. even the magazines have things that are just way too inappropriate for some people.  some of the movies they put out these days are just horrifying to see.  the fact that they put these things in a library shocks me greatly.     one day i was babysitting a little girl and i had taken her to the library.  there was a @caps on a shelf and she put it in her @caps player.  it  was making very sexual references and had many curse words in it.  i was mortified that the little girl had to hear those words at such a young age.  as soon as i put my ear to her head phones, i turned it off immediately. they should really watch @caps music they put put out to the public because if i hadn't of been with her, she might have picked up on some of those words.  i don't think @caps would want anyone listening to that kind of language at any age really. it disciminates woman and gives young children ideas in their heads of sexual activities.     one other thing they put out in libraries i don't agree with is magazines that are a little too mature.  i went to the library one day with a friend of mine and i picked up a @organization magazine.  i was flipping around and i saw all these revealing pictures and i was thinking to myself, '@caps if a yooung cjild picked up this magazine when no one was looking?' that would be a horrible experience for a young child to have.     i've read somewhere that things children see at a young age, have a great effect on who they will become.  if this is true i certainly thing we should censor @caps we out out in our public libraries and be careful if we take our children to the library.  we should make sure the next generation doesn't see certain things that we have.  we should also monitor the movies the watch and keep a close eye on the things they read
4 have you ever wanted something removed from the shelves of a library because you thought it was offensive? if so, how did you go about the situation and what did you want done about it? i know in my experiences i have found some things that were offensive, so i am sure that they are out there. i think there are so many rules, qualifications, or standards that can give someone reason to take something off a shelf, and those can be different for everyone.      if you were in a children's library or a school library, i am sure most people would agree that any book with offensive language, situations, opinions, etc. should be removed from the shelves. now if you were in a public library in the teenage or adult section and those same books that were inappropriate for the children's library are in the teenage or adult section, that might be admissable. the audience is different; therefore, the types of literature, music, movies, etc. can be more opinionated, mature, and controversial. part of why something should come off of a shelf depends on who is going to be reading it or listening to it.     in my opinion, there is a fine line as to what can be considered too controversial or too mature. @caps is one reason why i think there should be censorship because some things are definitely too controversial or mature. although, i also think there should be guidelines, and perhaps rules, on what should be allowed on shelves and what should not because some things might be on the edge of the line, but depending on what it is it can be, for example, a learning tool or great read.     as katherine paterson said, 'but if i have the right to remove that book from the shelf-that work i abhor-then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else.' @caps is why i think there should be guidelines or rules. if everyone had the right to remove something from a shelf, there might not be anything left to read or listen to. different things are offensive to different people. if there were rules or guidelines, that would ensure there would still be things to read and listen to in the future.     i think there should be censorship in libraries. some pieces of work are just too offensive, and they need to be taken off the shelves. i think it would be appropriate for some rules to be developed or some guidelines to be created. as paterson stated, 'all of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.'
3 i am writing this essay to puersuade the members of our local library to use better censorship when putting unfit material on the shelves for the members of our community to use. in this essay i will reflect my views of this subject, backed by true facts that i have learned from many passed experiences.     i believe that there is a large amount of reading material on the children section selves of our libraries that is far to advanced for many young children to understand. i myself have reviewed many of the books in the childrens section of many libraries. when doing so i noticed that many of the material makeing up this section is far to advanced or is to profound for children to absorb. young children need to be reading more books of fantasy to allow them to use their imagiation more and not let their head be filled with thoughts of war and disaster. the children that read today need to have more material offered to them that they understand and not so much material that they can't comprehend. lets use put more fit books on the selves of our library and quit wasteing our money on unfit books.     in reaching the conclusion of this article i hope that i have persueaded  the readers to understand the point i am trying to make. i hope my readers take the information i have givin and put it to work
3 raded @caps for @caps, violance and some nudety. this kind of movie shouldnt be on any kind of shelf. its to inapprope for kids, see or even read what the movie case says.     there shouldnt be any kind of movie or magazine with nude pictures. its bad for the kids to see or here because one day a little boy/girl is going to do something that they see in a movie or a magazine and get in trouble. its just wrong to see other people naked if u ask me. the only person i want to see that way is my wife in ten or so years. but i dont want to watch a movie and see a lady nude.       the nest thing is violance. man i just wish guns wernt invented or bombs. because i have lost alot of friends to guns. i lost about six cousins in the war from where a bomb hit there area. more and more people and going out and buying guns and bombs because, of movies and what people say in books and in magazines. people are getting name of guns and what they look like from movies and magazines and getting them and getting bombs off the black market. people get these ideas because of movies.      last but not least @caps it the main thing kids get in trouble for in schools. they leard it from movies mainly because the actor say the words. now the kids know how to say them. sitcs say that kids say and do what there favorite actor says and dose on and off the air.       my conclusion says that all every thing with violance should be taken off the shelfs
4 i believe that the children of today should be able to read, and learn the same things that our parents have learned in the past. learning things through the same teachings, books, movies... etc.      learning things this way would be better then taking out cussing, swaring and certain detailed writing, because if you took all that away its like lieing about history, and what really happend.     should the children of today be deprived of the truth? would you want your children going to school everyday and learning things from a text book that were twisted around just so that it was apropriate and non offencive? think about it... were you deprived of learning history when you were in school? i didn't think so, so why start now?     say your child is going to be reading '@organization' in @caps class today. would you want to ruin a classic book by taking the '@caps' word and the word 'slave' out of the book? depriving them of how there use to be slave owners, slaves, and racial comments? depriving them of actual history? would you also deprive them from learning about wars, revolutions, and mass killings just to make learning apropriate?     no. i wouldn't. i would want my children learning anything and everything about world history. i do not think that there should be censorship in libraries
6 dear @organization,     @caps i was growing up in my small little neighborhood, life could not have been more simple.  for children, life is eating, sleeping, playing, and laughing.  their innocent minds do not ponder the meanings of life or of love, but curiosity does grab every child now and then.  with a stubborn persistance, a child would probably go to the ends of the earth to understand what confidential information they overheard their parents talking about.  but @caps does harmless curiosity mean the destruction of a child's innocence?  by viewing adult-oriented material, such as books at a library, children can gain premature knowledge that can be harmful to their development.  however, libraries should not fear stocking their shelves with books that are appropriate for adults because an author spend countless hours writing that book,  that book represents a portion of history for the human race, and not everyone @month find the contents inappropriate.     authors have the freedom to write about whatever interests them, and taking away their right to display their thoughts and opinions is unjust.  a censored author must feel like a basketball player that did not make the cut despite hours of practice.  thus, an author that has practiced and perfected his writing skill does so in hopes of publishing his work.  not agreeing with someone's interest in a subject is no reason to exclude his valuable thoughts from society.  books that are appropriate for adults deserve to be displayed for adults as the author intended.     every piece of literature that has ever been written documents a portion of history of the human race.  even fictional novels serve as monuments to the depths of man's imagination.  therefore, no book should be censored, no matter how inappropriate the material is.  just as remembering the @caps has influenced mankind not to repeat past mistakes, keeping books of the most horrible content @month save authors from repeating such dishonorable content.  in other words, if censorship removes the 'mistakes' of literature from library shelves, who is to say that an oblivious author will not repeat that 'mistake'.  by remembering these mistakes, mankind will be able to move forward in literature.  @caps books are not 'mistakes', they serve as reminders of the high-points in literature.  all literature, appropriate and inappropriate, is a piece of mankind's history that should not be kept a secret.     finally, who is to judge what is a 'mistake' in literature?  a book on @caps @month be inappropriate in the eyes of a @caps, but that book @month be sacred to a @caps.  beauty is in the eye of the beholder.  furthermore, for any given book there is at least one person who disagrees with its message.  a library is built for the education of the public, not for the interests of one person.  if one is offended by a literary work, perhaps he should just move on and find a book more suited to his interests.  the decision on the appropriateness of a novel is up to the reader, not the government or library or activist group.     censorship of material in libraries would strip authors of their chance to let their works be seen by others, keep records of the human race secret, and take away the privelage of the reader to decide what is appropriate.  authors endure long hours of practice and writing in order to have their thoughts read, and such a motive should not be taken away from them.  every book represents some aspect of human life and records it for future generations to avoid previous mistakes.  and these 'mistakes' are decided by the reader, a decision that censorship takes upon itself.  instead of choosing what books are seen by the public, perhaps libraries should just create an adult-only section to house the 'controversial' books; as a result, mankind would stay educated and free, and children would remain innocent.                                   -@organization
4 there are many different perspetives on censorship in our country.  this is the human race, opinionative that is.  different perspectives come from different people: young, old, parents, and children.  in libraries there are some reading materials, that some @month find offensive.     offensive material in libraries is @caps directed to be read by young children.  they are also @caps inteded to be able to get there hands on such material.  even though this is @caps the purpose of that material, it happens that this material ends up in the hands of someone who shouldn't have it.  no the material is @caps held under lock and key, but it is also @caps left to lay at a child high shelf that would seem appealing to them.     the problem with removing all of this material from libraries would result in empty shelfs, except for the children's books.  the material that would have to be removed are books meant for people of the appropriate age group to inform and tell good stories.  if we protected children from censhorship this would deny knowledge, and also a get away for some, from the general public that anually go to the library.      @caps all movies, books, music, and other materials are labeled as they should be.  some material @month @caps be appropriate for children, but they also are @caps all inappropriate.  a rated '@num' movie @month be just like a rated '@caps' movie only with one extra reference, that @month be taken in the wrong way.  even protective parents @month allow their children to view movies like this as long as they find it appropriate.     libraries should @caps remove this material from their shelves.  if it is that much of an issue, then they could have the children books in a seperate room of the library.  there are many possibilities of keeping this kind of reading material away from children.  all of which do @caps have the need of removing these books and other materials from the libraries' shelves.     censorship in libraries is a contraversial subject.  there is a very good arguement on either side of whether or @caps to take offensive material off of shelves in the libraries.  i believe it should @caps be taken off and there are alternatives to this.  this essay proposed solutions to this problem without taking the public reading right away from everyone
4 in the library i have noticed that there are a few literature materials that are not suitable for a younger age group. such as rated @caps movies that contain things like drug use, sexual content, and extreme violence. not all libraries have movies, and the ones that do don't let anyone under the age of @num rent out a rated @caps movie. another example would be magazines that have articles/advertisments and pictures that are more towards the sexual side. this is a problem with children because then they think that that's how they should look and act, when they are older.     most libraries are divided up into different sections, there is a section for adults, teens, and children. the sections were created for a reason to show/tell people that some materials in this section @month not be suitable for teens and children. then if your in a childrens section you know that not many over the age of @num will be wanting to look around for books. in the childrens section a library normally makes it look bright and colorful which most children love. this helps the children stay there and not wonder off into one of the adult or teen sections.      when i was younger i didn't really care to go into the adult or teen sections cause i enjoyed reading 'the @caps in the @caps', '@caps @caps @caps @caps', and many other children books there. children have a lot of things to satisfy them at the library there's children movies/shows like '@caps @person'. they also have an unlimited amout of books that can keep them entertained. if movies and books don't work for them then there are also a few toys they can play with (at least the libraries i've been to have toys).         the only real big problem with having things unapropriate in the library is that the younger teens might wander into the adult section, and sometimes there are adult things in the young adult section. again with the movies, there are tv shows that i've seen at the library that are about teens doing drugs going to parties and getting drunk. things like that i think put a bad influence on younger teens. making them think it's okay to do drugs and drink, that it will make them more popular and cool.      over all i think that libraries just need to reorganize there books, movies, and magazines. then all the right items will be put in the right sections and there will be no accidents where someone accidently picks up something that is inapropitate for their age group. the music in the library i don't think is much of a problem. to me music is something more to express your feelings. this is my view on censorship in libraries
3 i feel that books, music, movies, and magazines should not be removed from shelves. just because some one @month finds them offensive. they only become offensive when people think they are.     i feel this way because no one is forcing any ony to watch or read any thing they dont want to. no one is telling sudents what they can and can't watch or read. every one has the choice. to choose what they want to read or watch.      what one person @month find offensive and wrang. another person. @month find interesting and exiting. i have felt the same way before, but that still gives me no resone to take it off the shelf. the next person after me. has as much the same right as i did. the person has the right to watch or read what i have. to like or hate what ever is on the shelves.     there are lots of things in a @caps. other than things that people @month find offensive. there are scary books like '@caps @caps.' @caps @organization best selling auther, @person. there are mistury books like 'the @organization.' @caps another @organization best selling auther, @person.     so to some up my esay. nothing sould be taken off @caps shelves. just because i or any one else finds them offensive
4 i firmly believe that the removing of books, music, movies, ect., from a shelf just because someone finds it offensive will not solve the problem. a person can find many things in life offensive to their personal views, but they can not just remove them. to remove books, music, movies, ect., from people who do not find them offensive could provoke chaos.          as katherine paterson stated 'and then we have no books left.' if everyone were to choose books, music, movies, ect., they felt were offensive and should not be placed in the library the statement would probably be true. besides the point the library is sectioned off into different genres, so if you have a different view of a certain genre of books, movies, music, etc., skip over that section and go to the genre in which you prefer.     in other words, the things that @month offend one person @month not offend another person. so to remove one particular thing would be unreasonable for the person who likes or finds interest in a particular subject. so instead of there being a problem with one person there would a problem with two unsatisfied people. not saying that it is right, but the library has done particular things such as, separating the books for reasons like this.     according to katherine paterson, 'all of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.' the library has a section for children only. therefore worries of problem like this have already been solved. the books, music, movies, ect., in the childrens section is age apprioate for a child. books, music, movies, ect., are also sectioned off for teenagers and adults.     in conclusion, the removal of books, music, movies, ect., that are found offensive by others @month not be found offensive by someone else. it is not like the library would purposely offend anyone by having the books, music, movies, ect., on the shelfs. if you are mature enough to understand that and over look something that @month offend you, you would not be so offended. also if the library is sectioned off into different genre, you can easly by pass a particular genre you wish to avoid. problems can  be easily solved if they are dealt with in the correct manner.
4 keep it on the shelf!     what types of things do you go to the library for? some go for books and others go just to relax in a quiet environment. yes, the library is mostly used for books and studying, but there are many other things that libraries contain. movies, magazines, music, etc., are all found in a library. now, say you had to listen to a specific song, read a certain book, or review an article in a certain magazine, and you can't find it at the library because they have been removed because they are found to be offensive. all people have different views on what is and isn't offensive. everything like books, music, magazines, and movies should all have their place in a library, regaurdless of the material.     books can be used for many things. some read just for the enjoyment and others read because it is assigned to them or they need to research some things. books give information and knowledge that some people need desperately. what if you can't find that book because someone said that its material is inappropiate? what are you supposed to do about your research paper now? if a book is needed it should be able to be found on the shelf in a library and not be taken out because of the content of its pages.     music is a great way to clear your mind and relax. some music found in libraries can be somewhat offensive to some people. what if the only place you can find your favorite music is at your public library? you walk in and they no longer have it because it is considered to be offensive. now you can no longer listen to the sounds that calm you down or modivate you to get your day started. music should remain in libraries because of the cultural and educational sounds that most cannot find at their local music store.     magazines are another great form of reading material found in a library. magazines are a great way to stay up to date with the latest fashions and great dessert receipes. without magazines our world wouldn't be able to keep up with the things that advance in our world everyday. magazines show us the hottest trends, the gossip in the celebrity world, and some great facts from educational magazines. without the magizines in the library we probably wouldn't know anything about our advancing world.     you can find movies anywhere, but some believe that you can only find the really good and old movies at the library. the library has educational movies for children that @month not be available anywhere else. they also have old classic movies that aren't even around anymore. the library has many movies that you wouldn't be able to find in our advanced world today.     libraries hold a lot of important books, movies, music, and magazines. without out most of that, regaurdless of the material, we probably wouldn't know as much as we know today. the library has always been a place where you go to find exactly what you want and you know that they will have it. removing these things from the shelves can be taking some history right out of our lives. all of theses resources should stay on the shelves regaurdless of their material.
4 'everyone has @caps @caps'     @caps is true that everyone has their own @caps and their likes and dislikes. for example, books. i do not like books that are about illegal substances, but i do believe removing certain materials that are offensive should not be removed from the shelves in the library. @caps is true that finding inappropriate book or an article @month be disturbing to certain people, but @caps does not mean that everyone finds @caps offenive.     once, my @caps class was assigned to do a book project. the main pourpose was to find a non-fiction book and create a powerpoint presentation on the main ideas of that book. one of the classmate read and had a breif presentaion over a book that was about illegal drugs. i know in fact that not many people are offended by the words such as 'drugs' or 'alchol', but i find these words to be obnoxious. while i found @caps disturbing and uncomfortable, others found @caps interesting. @caps was a topic that drew their attention, but not very appealing to me.     another example would be the time i went to the library to write a research paper about the human body systems. my friend, @location, found @caps disturbing to look at some pictures because @caps showed blood. strangly, i never thought blood as anything disturbing. while @person found @caps disgusting to look at, my head was in the book because @caps was fascinating. i always thought how the human body works is incredible. what @person did was instead of trying to deal with the picture, she wondered off and tried to find another book that does not have any grotesque pictures. the book did not have any benefit to @location, but because of that book, i received an 'a' on the research paper.     i believe @caps is important that people accept the fact that everyone does not have the same opinion. every individual is different in their own way. as i mentioned before, the book that was disturbing to me was interesting to others and vice versa. that is normal and there is nothing we can do to change about @caps. if permission were given to remove any certain materials that is offensive to each and every person, i guarentee that there would not be any material left on the shelves. i think the best way to solve this problem is for he/she to ignore the book that seems to be offensive and look for different material because others might need the resource
3 shut down libraries?     yes, i do, because music, movies, etc. could not only contain unnessisarry attire, they could also contain potty mouth language.  the words could, and can, corupt the minds of youngsters.  all librairies put them there because of the needs of customers.  the things they do to make some cash around here, do you agree with me?     they should create seperate libraries for each type of reader.  still, they put all of these things in the same building.  they should put up sales for kids' movies not adults, but the librarians say 'books are books'.  i think i'll write my own @caps sieries, thank you very much.     however, because some have dull enviornments, or lack of customers, some libraries close down.  make use of that thought i just told you.  i wonder if some books on endangered species of fish.  but some kid's sieries are dieing of because of more popular ones, or being replaced by some family stories.     if a little kid were to listen to some cursing, his/her mind will be warped for life.  what chic-cursing out loud in front of the baby.  how about saying '@caps @caps that?..' or '@caps that ball, you meanie!'?  maybe that will give some education.     however, some older boys and girls are teaching this bad language to the young mind-maybe even before they learn good language.  those dilenguents don't care about their minds at all.  your honor, i have my proof right here.  i suggest reeducating those teenage dilenguents to acting more @caps.
3 when walking into the library and children are finding books, movies and magazines they should not look at. it can be offensive. i believe that it is not the authors fault for the offensive language in their work. i can understand that parents can get upset if their child is reading a book they should not be looking at.     my opinion is that students should be able to choose what they want to read and if it is offensive to them they should stop reading the book. i feel that the student or adult should know if it is harmful to the student or not. censorship in the library is to find books for everyone to read.     i think that they should not ban anything in the library because it can be used for something useful to the person. i find it hard to believe that libraries will remove every offensive book, movie, or music from shelves because the rating of the item can be horrible.     i just don't think it should be a good idea for them to ban things from libraries if they need to use the information from the book. if it offends them then they should not read the book, and choose another book. authors work too hard for writing their book and go through the publishing process.      my opinion is a no because i feel they should not remove items off shelves of the libraries because the content of the item is not appropriete to someone. my views can vary when i am older and have children of my own someday. but as of right now i do not think they should remove items off shelves at libraries
3 do you believe that certain materials, such as books, music,movies,magazines, should be removed from from shelves if they are found offensive. no i dont believe that certain materials should be removed if found offensive. many kids today are into gang realted activites because they see parents,older siblings, or even friends into so they decide to do the same because they feel its cool.    teens now days really dont care the movies, or the music. not all music or movies are offensive. so we cant blame that. we can only blame ourselves for allowing our children to watch @caps @caps movies listen to uncut music. we choose that life style for our children so we cant really blame the music and the movies. the people who make their uncut music or @caps @caps movies dont care who watches it or what affects it would have on children and neither does the parents. they're just trying to make a living like everyone else.      if parents can change they way they raise there children i think the world would be a better place. just because some say that offensive movies, music or even magazines should be removed doesnt mean its there fault. its the parents chose to say its okay if they child should listen to or watch offensive music and movies
3 have you ever been to a library and found a book offensive?in my opinion i believe that books, music, movies, magazines, etc., are at the library for a reason. the reason being say if we wanted to check out a movie and everywhere else was to expensive to get it, why wouldn't you just get it at the library if they had it. most libraries that i've gone to have certain sections for adults and children. that means there would be appropiate things for little children to read in the section that they have been given. if children under age were to wander off into the adult section that would be their fault if they saw something unapproiate not the libraries.     if the case was if every time a child or someone under age took a book offensive, i belive that the libraries wouldn't have as much of books in their buildinds that grown ups would like to read. of course i'm not trying to say that there should be extermely unappropriate books wandering around in the library that the small children should see. i'm just saying that the adults do have the right to have books that they would be interested in.when i've gone to the libraries i have found books that i have enjoyed reading and i'm not the type of person that would just grab a book and be interested in right away. there are books, movies, magazines, and music that have strange titles that some people might take offensive to, but those are the ones that get read more or listend to more or watched more.     i believe that no material should be taken off of the shelf just because one person found it offensive. if the person doesn't like the idea of the people in the library not taking the material off; it's the person personal problem i think. for example there is this book called '@caps' and it's about a teenager who got into drugs real bad and got pregnate at a young age. that book was one of the best selling books in the world. if somebody took that offensive and asked for the book to be removed then it's their loss.     i mean if there were a book about how to murder somebody then yeah i would ask for that material to be taken off the shelf immeditely. except no library in this entire world would have that kind of stuff up so why worry about it.if there were ever to be that type of situation then that would be bizzare.but i highly doubt that it would come to a point like in time. so in conclusion that is my opinion on this
3 offensive material shouldn't be taken off the shelves at all. books are written on various of topics from love to sci-fi. everyone is offended by something; if all of us could remove a book that we precieve as offensive then the human race wouldn't read anymore.     @person had to demonstrate this in a similar aspect to congress concerning his music lyrics. @person is the reason why there is an '@caps' sticker on @caps's that contain offensive lyrics. books should @caps be censored at all. it hides the authors thoughts, idea, and meanings behind their writing.     i've read hundreds of books from @location to @location. the aspect that a parent is worried about what their children might read implies parents need to step in. having an one-on-one talk about the books context with their child could solve this uneasiness parents have about books.     pre-@caps to @caps to @caps requires many stages of growing physically and menatally. through those phases kids learn from various sources including negative ones. it's up to the parents to ensure that tomorrow's generation can depict what is truthful and what is false.     my grandmother shared a memory about when i was @location learning to read. i was reading out of a @caps magazine; yes the magazine is intended for adults but i obtained the skill to read from it. a skill that will propell me into job oppertunities and assist me in everyday life.
3 there a books, music, movies, magazines, and etc. that are not appropriate for children. having them banned from shelves shouldnt even be a question, if children shouldnt read, watch, or listen to it then its the parents responsibility to make sure they dont.     i dont think they should take those kind of books, movies, or music off the shelves because what about teens that like them or grown ups also. there just gonna take them down for the children but lose buisiness from grown ups and teens. that doesnt make any sence at all. i think either the child should know what he or she can read, watch, or listen too, and if they cant then its up to the parent or a grown up around them to let them know what they can choose.     a way to solve the problem can be seperate those offensive books, music, or movies from ones that are appropriate for children. that would make everything alot easier so nothing comes off the shelves and knowone loses buissiness.
5 it is important to know what is going on or what has gone on in the world. if @caps is unaware, problems can only be helped to a short extent. there is a point in which words can turn into harrassment, but the boundaries before reaching that point can be fairly defended by the freedom of speech. @caps must learn in order to teach. @caps must teach for others to learn. censorship in libraries is more offensive than the material that is hidden.censorship should be prohibited because knowledge and time is all we have and everyone must receive and give respect.      if @caps were to look up information about the government on the internet, that person would not find a lot of useful information. it is a challenge to find why same-sex marriage is illegal in some areas or if the words on the news are true. in this generation, our species relies on cellphones, websites with recent dates, and the news. it seems that the time of research is diminishing. @caps can only learn so much from a world history textbook. it @month not be completely accurate. the passing of the information from historian to historian over the centuries can potentially be described as the game telephone. with such a high risk of being mislead, the world needs as much information and thought as it can get. knowledge, no matter the content, is valuable. it can help @caps to learn from mistakes and solve problems. the world cannot afford to censor. censorship does not change the existence of that censored author's thoughts or the reality of what has occurred. the hidden information could be helpful. as this essay is being read, people are dying. it can easily be counted: @caps, @caps, @caps. they are gone. at any moment, anyone and everyone could die. time is mainly all we have. we need knowledge to make the most out of it.     everyone deserves to be heard. if @caps were to refrain from listening when being spoken to, it would be disrespectful and offensive to the speaker. a lot of the people in underdeveloped countries go with their starving cries unheard. such cries make the more fortunate, well-fed, and housed people such as myself uncomfortable. despite such discomfort, this information should not be hidden from anyone. no matter how uncomfortable or offensive a material @month be, perhaps the author is simply thinking for himself/herself. perhaps the author does not find it offensive, and is simply trying to make sense of the world because that is all @caps can do with all of the problems that exist. every single person has the right to be heard. the people that believe something should be censored or hidden could have completely different opinions from others. there is no absolute, divine being that can accurately judge a material. the people that censor could be wrong about the content of the material. because of the great variety of opinions and concept of respect, everyone must be heard.     censorship should not be allowed because time and knowledge are the valuable building blocks that determine the future of humanity and not a single thought should go unheard. censorship is a great hindrance to knowing what is occurring and what has occurred in the world. truth is knowledge and knowledge is truth. it is up to the world to unleash it and make something out of it.
4 the idea of censoring books and music in our libraries has long been debated. libraries are places that people can go to stray away from the norm and get lost in the works of other authors and musicians. i believe that reading and the ability to express oneself through the powers of music is a very essential part of our lives. censoring these would only shelter our lives and keep younger generations from discovering the effect that words have on our emotions and actions from day to day.      books are one of the oldest forms of information we've had throughout the years. i think that if someone were to remove a piece of information that they found offensive it would only open the door to other people to find excuses to keep the hard work of authors behind closed doors.     personally i enjoy reading. i think that with every book i read it opens the door to other beliefs and culturs that i would otherwise never learn about. children need to be able to explore the world, to get to know how other civilizations grow and function as to how we in the @location function in our own little world that is getting more and more judgemental every day. the only way to do this is to pick up a book from someone who has been lucky enough to experience it themselves.     i have always had a deep passion for music. when i want to relax music helps me to center myself and open my mind. in my opinion, censoring music shouldn't be something that people even consider. removing music from libraries is difficult for me to even begin to try and accept.      freedom of speech was once a huge part of our country. now it seems as if everything we've been taught of our great @location has been nothing more than just a false cover to let the government control how we live, act, and now how we choose to express ourselves. music is a freeing way to express oneself in a not so violent way. during the sixties and seventies, music was the way alot of people protested things like war and racism without being violent. times have changed though and the people in charge of our country no longer see it as an 'appropriate' option.      i belive that just because one society believes something to be inappropriate, doesn't mean that it actually is that way. we worry enough already about what other people think, why try to judge others' work if we can't accept the fact that we are all different. if we all accepted the differences in our world's cultures, there wouldn't have to be a debate on whether or not to censor an expressive and emotional piece of art that deserves to be shown in our libraries
5 good? bad? offensive or not? these are just a few of the questions asked when referring to content in any given book, magazine, or even a song. who are we to judge what's good, what's offensive, or even what is appropriate for any being?     from things such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc. the author(s) @month express what they feel on a given topic. though their opinion might not please others, there's nothing that can be done about it. in society people are going to talk, to write, to sing, to listen. whether everyone agrees with that is a different story.      in society, no matter what the topic is, there will always be at least one person that has a problem with it. the world will never be perfect! the only thing that can be done to assuage the chaos is for people to self censor what they @month ingest from reading or listening to these different books and lyrics. if one shows so much emnity towards a given topic, then they are able to do as they please, and choose not to listen/read.      at the bottom of numerous cd's, both explicit and non, there is a label, an advisory that warns a person. it will briefly tell you that there is some content they @month not be appropriate, that @month hurt feelings, and simply offend. it is then that one can choose to listen to the cd or not.      every human is entitled to freedom of speech. this doesn't necessarily mean that everything said by a being is okay; but everyone is entitled to his own opinion. there are words spoken that will offend many! from @person using racial slurs in speeches, to @location calling females derrogatory words, all the way back to a white male calling his colored friend a nigger.      people will always be offended. there are many different ways of looking at life, and many different opinions. not everyone agrees with one another, because everyone is unique in his own way. from ethnicity to personalites, from talented athletes to intelligent students, and even from ancestors to religion. everyone has something that defines them and makes them who they are. we are all special; and we all think differently. we find certain slurs and lyrics offensive, while others @month not.      @num years ago when i was in @num grade, my @caps class was reading a story about the '@caps @caps @caps'. there were @caps young black children striving to get a respected education in a white school. times were tough then, and there was still alot of racism in @location. as my teacher read us this book everyday, we all sat and listened taciturnly. after the third day of reading this book, we all sat down like usual ready to finish the book. five minutes into class as the teacher was reading the book, she read and enunciated every word in the book. in the middle of the sentence, it read 'nigger-lover', and the teacher didn't hesitate a bit as she said it. in less than @money, @num blacks children walked out of the room yelling curse words at the top of their lungs. this teacher didn't realize that she had offended these children by what she took as simply reading to her class.      the book '@caps @caps @caps' wasn't censored in any way. though many children looked at it and felt some of the terms were harsh, no one ever thought there would ever be a riot caused at school. because the teacher was white, and the children didn't want her to say that word, everyone attacked her vocally.      i've began to realize that everyone cannot be pleased. there will always be at least @num person that stands up and retaliates against something they dislike. in '@caps @caps @caps', the book wasn't censored, but i still believe that it should stay on library shelves. that book allowed children to better understand how hard life was in the past. by keeping the harsh language, i feel as if people realize how much harder times were.      books, music, movies, and magazines will always contain a statement that someone doesn't agree with, and by removing that i feel like one can not fully understand the message the author is trying to get across. for all of these reasons, i proudly say that i believe that these different books, movies, lyrics, and magazines should be kept on the shelves
4 i believe that many books in our local libraries @month come off as crude or offensive to many readers, but i also believe it has a lot to do with the maturity level of some people. for instance, if you are an adult you will most likely be looking in the adult section. there @month be children who look through that same section, although their parents should be monitoring what they are checking out at their local libraries.              although maturity has a lot to do with it, some young adult books probably aren't intended for the people reading them. some young adult books @month be venturing too far, and the children who are reading these books probably shouldn't be. i don't think that everyone should have access to check out whatever they want whenever they want. many parents have different rules for their children then others, and they @month not agree with what is displayed among these shelves for their child to checkout. i remember times when i was a little my parents didn't always let me check out what i wanted, because i was too young to be viewing it in the first place          as for adults, they are free to make their own choices on what to checkout. i don't think the adult section at the libraries should be monitored all that much, because as an adult you are free to make your own decisions. you know whats right and whats wrong, and no one person should have to tell you what you should or shouldn't be reading.     the area that i would be most concerned with would be the young adult section. at that point children are at an awkward growing stage were they themselves are still learning whats right and wrong. some books or movies could effect the young viewers dramatically. their parents @month be letting them watch horrific movies, and it could make them feel as if what they're watching is really okay. i think parents should be very involved in their children's lives, and closely monitor what their children are reading or watching.     i do feel that some books should be monitored, and taken off the shelves if they are found inappropriate for the intended age. mostly in the children and young adult sections, because they could be taking in information they shouldn't be. i also feel that parents should take a part in their childs life, and set limits to what their child is aloud viewing. above all, i think that everyone should check out books in their appropriate age section
4 should offensive material be censored?     removing things such as books, music, movies, magazines, ect., that are found offensive could be both good and bad. it could be good because younger children wouldn't be exposed to things that are considered offensive. although, it could be bad because it takes away from freedom of choice. most young children don't know good from bad, so censoring these things for them could be good. though, you shouldn't want to shelter your children from the real world. protecting your children from things that offend you, @month stop them from growing up badly. censoring such stuff now doesn't really change what is already out there.     censoring or removing things that you find offensive @month be a good idea. there are plenty of reasons someone @month want to do this. a parent @month not want their child to read, hear, or see something simply because it offends them. another reason parents @month want to censor these things is just because they don't want their child exposed to it. parents know that most young children don't know right from wrong, so they'd like to make that choice for them. by doing this, a parent knows what their child is reading, hearing, or seeing. some parents @month feel that they need to protect their children from these things because it could be harmful to them. they also @month feel this should be done so their child doesn't grow up badly.     removing offensive material from shelves would take away from a person's freemdom of choice. who wants to be told what they can and cannot read? if a parent does this to their child, it just sheltering them from the world around them. a child should be able to know the life around them before they grow up and are completely lost. parents @month think that this is good idea because it protects their children from things that @month be considered bad. when really, protecting them could be harmful. censoring books, movies, music, ect., won't stop what is already bought and out in our world. offensive music, movies, books, ect., have already been bought and sold for years.     i feel that censoring or removing books, music, movies, magazines, ect., should not be done. it doesn't give people a choice. some people @month like reading graphic novels or things like that. music is made for the enjoyment of the people. some people like their music to talk about drugs or curse, why take that away from them? it just wouldn't be fair to take a choice away from someone. a movie is just a movie, it's not real. just because something is done in a movie doesn't mean that a person will go off and do it. i think people should be able to have a choice.     censoring such stuff now doesn't really change what is already out there. if people stopped to think about it, they would realize that offensive material has already been bought by others. plenty of people have illegaly downloaded, or bought music that uses inapropriate language. this music is already in their ipods, @num's, and burned onto @caps, there's no removing it. books that some @month find offensive have already been printed and sold to others. one person @month lend that book to another, therefore the offensive book is being spread around. plenty of movies that involve adult content, violence, and drugs have been released into the media. lots of people own these kinds of movies. so, why censor things now, when there's already unremovable offensive material out?
4 @caps us? @caps now? those questions just might be flashing through your head right now.  the reason @caps i am writing to you today is to give you my point of view on the censorship in the worlds libraries today.  in this context hopefully i will be able to enlighten you on the subject, also with the questions of '@caps us?', and '@caps now?'.     censorship, what does that mean to you?  to me that means censoring many things in the world to protect it from children who are under the age, not people who are old enough to handle inapropiate things.  in todays libraries there are many uncensored things, that happen to be in the adult section of the libraries.  things such as books, movies, and magazines should not be removed from the adult section, also labeled as the uncensored section, if that is where they rightfully belong.  now you are probably wondering, @caps us.     in today's world many people want to protect their children from harmful things, such as uncensored materials. @caps us?  in the world today there are so many laws, regulations, and even authorities protecting our rights. now many people want to try to get around the government protecting our rights.  many want to protect their youth from some of the so called 'harmful' things in society.  today you can try to create a law or bill that @month make it through the government, now some of them are trying to remove the uncensored material.         @caps now?  throught the years the world has changed, everything has become easier to have access to.  now one thing they think they @month be able to do is remove the adult section of the libraries if enough people stand to fight for it, it will not happen.  there is an adult section for adults not children, people need to realize that.       in the end, the adult section needs to stay in our libraries. some of the material in the section is not always bad, sometimes it contains material over war, and recessions.  when people are of age they are allowed to enter the areas, not any younger.  don't punish the rest of the world for one libraries mistake of letting children have access to adult material, make the children realize it wasn't their area to be in.  then many parents @month see it's not just some of the world, that the whole world is exactly the same way. the books, music, magazines, and etc., need to stay where they are
2 i dont think that they should remove music, movies, magazinwa, etc., should be tooken away because if you take all of that away then there really wouldnt be anything to do in your spaire time but be bored. i know alot of people couldn't handle being bored. i know i couldnt handle it if all i was bored all the time because someone took away music. now it would be a different story if we never had music, movies, and all that other good stuff. none would really care becaused they new what it was or hurd about it. how would you feel if you had to drive for @num hours and didn't have any music or magazines to read? i'm thinking you would be really bored im guessing.
4 have you ever felt that books are offensive? maybe, but @caps all depends on who you are and @caps angers you. somepeople think that books, music, movies, and etc. can be offensive in some way. i know they can, but @caps can only effect an amount of people if they together understand the problem. i think there are several ways why and why not to take books out of our libraries.     from @caps i hear, people do go angry over things but the question is '@caps gets them so angry?' @caps is different for somepeople than others. for example, a @organization fan reads a book about them and the author makes fun of them or teases them. that is a way to make someone offended and angry at a book. others can get mad at a movie because @caps discriminates races of other kinds. like how in the @num's, some movies characterized @caps @caps as stubborn, ignorant, human beings. in my view, actually being @caps @caps myself, sort of aggrivates me too, but none the less, shouldnt argue because of one major amendment, freedom of speech.     @caps depends on how @caps angers them also, like how back in world war @num, the @caps people were characterized as short, fat people with big noses taking all the money away from the @caps. that can be offensive, and is used usually to talk people over to their side. i think that if something offends you lightly, most of the time you shouldnt worry about @caps, but if you get offended very heavily and none of the stuff they say about that topic is true, maybe you should get someone else to read @caps with the same dislikes and likes as you. that could help determine if @caps is truly offrnsive to people in general, not just you.      then after that the main question we would ask would be '@caps should we do next?' if i were someone and the book i'm reading offends me massively, i would contact the library @caps came from and ask them to read @caps, and if they think @caps is offensive, then they would more than likely take @caps off the shelfs. now just because of someone that likes a sports team reads a book about them and the book talks trash about the team, dont tell the library, thats just a waste of time. just simply pick up another book and read @caps. i can understand how people will get mad over racism and disrimination, but not over a sports team.     so i hope that people can someday understand the limit to were something can actually be offending. or maybe its just in our common nature for us to be offended when something we like gets made fun of. that is why i think that books should only be taken off shelfs for only very good reasons, not silly one
3 what do we find offensive? in a library there are hundreds of materials that can be offensive to anyone. for example with movies there are horror, sci-fi, comidey, romance, advinture, etc. and all of them are offensive to someone. if we were to take down all of the movies that are offensive to a person all the movies would be taken off.    should we take all things that are offensive to us off the shelves, or leave them so people who do enjoy them do. i belive that we should leave these materials alone. it should not be right for us to choose what a public library should and shouldn't have on their shelves.     if a person finds a item offensive, then they should ecnore it, not make a big deal of it. many poeple learn to keep their oppeins to themselves but some do not. people who juge by what they don't like, tend to make themselves known
4 as a student at a public school, the libraries that i and many other students have access to are censored to an extent. with our library being censored i do not feel that the public library should be.          why is censorship a conflict in need of discussion; every book found on a shelf is a part of history so every author that was good enough to get published should be able to have their book on a shelf. while school libraries are already censored for their age group; i feel that public libraries should not be censored for the plain reason that you, your gaurdian, but also the library has control over what they find age appropriate.           if disliking the book is a problem; then put it back. find something more common towards your own interest. some things @month be considered inappropriate as many things are, but at the same time each person has their own limits to this. while someone @month dislike a teen magazine because of how it effects youth, another @month find it inspiring. if every person found a way to rate things according to their own taste, there would be nothing left on the shelves; as katherine paterson expressed in her quote.          when you enter a public library; it is divided into sections according to interest, age, author, ect.. when you enter a school library it is done according to fiction, non-fiction and author. censorship amoung public libraries is not needed. adults, students, and childeren all go to a public library. so, as the case @month be why would you censor a library that goes for all ages. i feel that yes an @caps, or @caps school library should not contain the same content as a @caps school library. but a public library, is for the public. hints the name.          in conclusion, if even more censorship was done to public libraries, libraries would be used less than they already are. some of the content in public libraries can't be found in school libraries, but also adults wouldn't be able to find the content needed for their own interests, jobs, or even schooling. so as the fact @month be that some things @month seem innappropriate to certain age groups, it can help someone in a completely different age group.
3 all terms of offense are based on an opinion. if one person finds a particular word offensive, doesn't mean the next guy will feel the same way. some parents aren't as strict on there kids as others, and some just dont care.      of course there's always that gangster rap that talks about drugs and women being objectified that kids really dont need to belistening to. the horror movies that are rater ''@caps' for a reason, they could have nightmare for weeks. children's mental states aren't fully developed at a young age like ten. they still cant tell whats real and whats not. they need a trusted adult to rely on to tell them how to feel, to act, to do, even to think. children just are't mature enough to handle a mojority of material in this world. no books should be taken away or hiddne fvrom society, it should just be given to you at your own disgression. another possiblility would be have a group of many people gather and vote on age restrictions for particualr material. all information is helpful, just not all is necessary.     these days its hard to hide all harmful material from children, even some teenagers. this wolrd is becoming less and less sensitive everyday. eventually everyone will be completly insensitive to all 'harmful' movies, books ,amgazines, @caps shows, and music. it wont even phase anyone anymore.
3 has anyone ever stopped and thought about the negative aspects of censoring a book? many people of different beliefs take offense to books that show negativity to their ideas. when people are offended by a book the first idea that comes to mind is to try and get the book off the shelves by censoring it from libraries. i think that if a book offends a certain group of people they should just simply not read it.     why should other people not get a chance to read a good book just because it offends someone else? banning books would go against what our country stands for. how different would it make us if we started censoring books in our libraries like other countries with governments who have the final say on what can and can not be read?      imagine what life would be like if all books found offensive were stripped from our shelves; there would be nothing left because anyone can find something offensive in any book. i understand that sometimes things written in books can really be disturbing ,and offensive but that doesnt give anyone the right to just take it off the shelves. censoring books is a short term answer to a long term problem.     i believe that if we always resort to censoring books then we will become a less creative society. there are many people who @month actually want to read a book but never get chance just because it is censored from library. books that are censored are usually the books that help ones imagination. would you want to live in a world where people are void of creativity?
2 to be honest if i was a librarian i would leave them up on the shelfs accoding to what @month state law would have to say. if the state doesn't have any promblems with having them up on the shelfs then all student body will be able to check them out. having magazines shows whats new in the world and what is not. also just like checking out a book how you have to take a test over it called reading counts. then you would have to read an article from a page in the magazine and wright an essay over it and submit it to whom ever is in charge of that department.
2 i believe that if it has offensive language then it shouldn't be left of the shelf. also it really does matter if it has offensive language because you don't know who, where, when you child is going to learn offensive words. another thing he's  going to say any offensive words. next one of the most important thing is that if you want your child to never have offensive language or any other bad thing you should watch what you say, what you do. one reason why is because once he growing up he might follw you foot steps. another thing is that if the magazine, movie, book, etc.,might have some raisem thing like jugging the person from where he/she come from, how they look, how they talk etc., can end up in a bad situation. in conclusion what i'm trying to say that it's both parents and book because the book your child has choosen might bad thing and the parents should watch them self on how they act
4 devin @num @num                                   @caps @caps    do you like the libary? there is always an argument about how books, music, movies, magazines, ete., should be removed from the shelves if people find them offensive. which brings me to @caps @caps; there is always the choice of a different libary to choose from. you also don't have to look at the book or watch the movie. being an @caps author you have the freedom of speech, you can write whatever you feel like writing.      first, is your choice of libary. there is sevral different libraries in one town. some have childern sections, where all the books are appropriate for young childern to read. also the parents of the childern need to keep an eye on what their child will be reading, or looking at. there has to be at least twenty to thirty libaries in @location, so you always have a different option.     second, you don't have to read the book, or watch the movie. if you see something you don't like about the book, why complain about it? just put the book down, someone else might be interested in the book. you have the freedom to pick out the book.       last, is the freedom of speech of the author of the book. being an @caps citizen you have the right to write down whatever you want to write down. so people do not have the right to blame the author for what he or she writes down. many people have been inspired by certain books that throughout history have been controversial.  where would we be without those books and authors?     i have given you three reasons on @caps view of censorship in libraries. you have the choice of libraries, you don't have to read the book, and the author has the freedom to write what they choose
3 i think that some books should be banned from libraries that are offensive or use certain words against people, i think that should apply to highschool libraries because it really would matter in elementeries because they wouldn't know what some things mean. if a class were to read an offensive book and someyone in the class from the opposite race that reads the book others could get affended and it could start a fight.     some high schoolers could get affended quicker than others and which could cause a lot of problems so by avoiding that there should be votes on books that should be banned or not be aloud to be read in class or in school period. im pretty sure people would think its dumb to ban books but trust it me it would solve a lot of problems, but it all comes down to whats acceptable and whats not without hurting other peoples feeling and putting them down.     i bet all the time in classes theres been a story that has been read that has talked about races which makes others not feel comfortable, and theres always that person that always trys to make fun of something, but if i were in this situation i would try my best to not let others get to me and interfer with my grades and performance. i would just ignore them as much as possible and if it did start getting annoying i would talk to my counselor about trying to talk to that person individually or just removing me from class. i'm pretty sure most schools wouldnt tolerate this type of behavior but you will always have those kind of kids you just have to ignore.               you should never not go to school thinking you don't fit in just because someyone is making fun of your race or how you look. they just try to make the day harder on you and all you have to do is ignore them or report it and hopefully it is taken care of
4 what other people take as offensive might be taken to others as something they value. i believe that all sorts of books, music, and magazines should stay on the shelves at the library. people value many different things and we need to give others an opportunity to explore what else there is.                                                different types of books explain different types of things. some people connect with books in a way that others @month not understand. taking certain types of books away can risk other peoples feelings. taking music, in my opinion, would be the worst because people get lost in some types of music. they use music to escape their probems and taking that away can leave them helpless. people love movies. it helps people understand what is going on in other peoples point of views. taking away movies could leave people with no entertainment. people like different movies and some movies can be offensive. but, it's not up to anybody else. magazines help people keep up with news. most of the news can be very offensive. it is the people around you causing the offensive news. taking away magazines can be keeping people from the latest gossip and news.                                          taking away things that people use to connect with, what they use to escape with, their entertainment, and the news would most likely cause peoepl to act out in a bad way. everybody is defferent and everybody likes different things and taking away something that others think is offensive is unfair to the people that think it isn't. what if somebody thought what you liked was inappropriate? how would you feel?
4 'the @caps in the @caps', 'the @caps @caps', 'the @caps of @person'.  do these titles sound familiar? they should, beause these are only a tiny fraction of the @caps literary masterpeices that people have enjoyed since their publications.  these wonderful books also share another characteristic, they have all been banned from certain libraries across the country and around the world.       when a child goes off to school ecah day, his or her parents are left to think that he or she will be getting a quality education that meets the stadards of their own core values and morals.  but certain parents @month become outraged when they see the books shelved on schools library shelves that they see as wrong, and don't want their precious children exposed to such immoral concepts that go against their idea of what is right.  in all reality though, how is this helping anyone?     by keeping a student away from a book or subject, the person causing the censorship is limiting what that student can learn.  by censoring things people are not only kept from ideas that might shock them, but also from ideas that might make them think.  if a person cannot think for themselves, they cannot draw their own conclusions on things.  when one cannot think for oneself or make decisios for oneself, how can this person be considered a free individual.       infamous dictators, such as @person, burned books to keep his citizens from thinking what he did not want them to think.  by banning a book in a school library, a parent is also keeping their child from thinking what they do not want them to think.  and when you want a book out of a shool library you are ot only keepig your child from reading this book, but everyone who goes to the school from reading the book. how is that fair?      so instead of wanting certain books to be off the shelves of your childs school, i say this.  teach your children to be careful in what they read.  if you don't wan them to read 'the @caps in the @caps' tell them not to read that book.  tell your children to follow the moral guidelines you want them to follow, and if certain books keep them from having their own thoughs instead of yours, just tell them not to look, and don't bother everyoe else about it
4 freedom of speech and the freedom of press is a privelige we as @caps are lucky to have. i don't believe in censorship in libraries. authors, publishers, editors, and directors all have a right to express their opinions in their work. if they would like to express some adult subjects in their work that is their choice. they have a right as people to protray their books, magazeines, and movies anyway they want.      we all have the choice to what books and movies we want to check out at libraries. movies are required to have ratings so the audience knows the extent of the maturity you must have to watch the film. for example if you are a @num year old who wants to checkout a movie but, it's rated @caps that is not the best choice of movie. it @month not be the best choice because movies rated @caps let the audience know its for a mature audience over the age of @num.      as for books, i often use a book review website that allows me to see the content the book has. if i see that the book contains material i don't wish to read about or think the material is too mature, i don't read it. i hold the power to choose the books i read and the responsibility to choose the books best suited for my age and maturity level.      there are many ways we can track the content of the things we can checkout. just because a movie or book is released doesn't mean we have to watch or read it. we all make choices in our everyday lives.some are big and some are small. picking a book or film to checkout from a library is a small choice, but it is our choice to choose what we can handle.      author's, directors, and editors should not have their work punished if some people don't agree with the content they are putting in their material. everyone's opinion varies on what's right and wrong. therefore if you believe something is inappropriate you have the chocie of not reading or watching it.      i do believe we are lucky to have this freedom of opinion and speech. although we shouldn't abuse it we must not forget we have no right to tell others how to use this freedom. as we have the choice to read what we want to, authors have a choice on what they want to write about. libraries shouldn't take away this freedom that allows us to make our own decisions on what we view or read
4 have you ever sondered through the libray just to specifically find that one good book, magazine, or even cd that didn't involve inapropiate material for once? you feel like a little kid in the shopping mall just inpatiently waiting to find that one toy, but it never shows up. you spend seconds, minutes, even hours still slowly pacing back and forth shelf to shelf, and finally you find it and you open it and see the most innapropriate picture ever, or maybe listen to the most vulgure language, or even take a skim through the most offensive reading yet. do you wish it'd change?     i visit the library every time after i finish my book, i have loved reading from the time i was little. lately i feel like my reading iterest has gone down though, not due to my act of being involved in other things, but possibly because lately i feel like every book i pick up comes off offensive. for example i went to  the check out a new book, i was mind boggled at this time because unlike usual i had no clue on which book i was even interested on to read next. the librarian directed me to there new best seller and said addressed it and said it was as hard to put down as a lollipop. i checked it out and after the first paragraph i wanted to throw up. this book and too gory and i felt like it downgraded women, i was anything but satisfied. this wasn't the first book me or my friends had checked out like this, and i have a feeling it won't be the last. i just hope i could check out a book not so offensive and actually worth my time, but it seems like lately they are all changing and becoming too much for me, and it really upsets me.     our library seems to be over packed with magazines, which isn't a bad thing because i love them. i label magazines as a light read and very good at passing free time. i never get tired of all the pictures, all the gossip, and all the jokes at the end. lately my opinion has changed though, these magazines are starting to alter and i don't like it. it seems as if i can't open my page without seeing a half dressed girl, some innapropriate advertisement, or even tons of personal display of affection. seeing these vulgare images are enough to make me not only flip the page, but also never second guess about opening a magazine again.      music is like a drug to me, and i am addicted. there is never a day that goes by that i do not listen to music, but lately music just isn't the same. i go to the library to check out some new cd's and it seems everything i bother listening to uses every curse word out there. i was furious after my purchase, but also disappointed that people actaully sell this garbage. i am somebody who listens to music to relax, not develop a new innapropriate vocabulary.      i know there are plenty of good books, magazines, and music out there. we just need to find it again. i hope that we can banish these offensive, vulgar, and unnesesary items at the library. i know i'd greatly appreciate it, and from what i heard many others would too. we want reading utensils worth reading, we want magazines our eyes won't mind to take a glance at, and we won't music that won't pollute our brains
3 there are a lot of issues concerning offensive material that are used for entertainment purposes. sometimes these things should not be on the shelves. such as movies, books, magazines, etc., they can be seriously offenseive to other people that are different races or different religions.     censorship can be used to solve this problem, like in the book @caps @num, it was used to keep books out of the picture completely. to keep the society from becoming offended, or for that matter, thinking. however in this matter it is the complete opposite, having all kinds of negative material and not caring what it can do to other people, or @month damage other people.     however this can also be argued. the people that are offended by the material, wether religious or race, really don't have to be around the material in the first place. for example if the material is in a library, then the people don't need to go to the library.           in conclusion people don't have to be near the offensive stuff if they are offended, but people should not be so cruel also.
3 should there be cenorship in the libraries or not? many people have there own personal view on this subject. everyone should know their own boundaries of what they know is appropriate to look at and what isn't. libraries shouldn't have to remove books and etc. that they themselves have purchased to get. now they want them cenored? i don't think that is very right.          libraries should take all the cenored material and make a part of the library where the customers can't see from the main section and it would be open to the customers who would like to go in that specific section to check out a book or anything else that @month apply to that section. the library was build for anyone who just wanted to go to a place to escape the troubles of their own world and just go sit in a library and read. not everyone goes to the library for a book, some go to listen to music, some go to read a magazine, well whatever it is for the libraries can't take out the material that people go there just go get. how do they expect customers to come back if they're taking material out of the library? the internet and @caps is way more offensive than material in a library so what gives them the right to say get all your offensive inappropriate material out of the library. if libraries have to do that then so should all the other entertainment industries.     finally every library should have their own control over what they think is best for their own facility. my opinion says we should just move the material else where in the building, in it's own little wing or something. where people could if they would like to go in and check something out but if people didn't want to go in they sure don't have to. everyone has thier own personal opinion on this subject, and well i gave you mine
4 the library is a public place. everyone is allowed acces to the library. it supplies everyday people with information that they are seeking to learn about. there are so many different forms of information and entertainment offered inside libraries. books, music, movies, etc, they all can be found there. since they all can be found, censorship in libraries should not be allowed.     genres were created for a reason. certain items have different forms to them. there are many forms of music. classical, rock, and blues are some examples. since music is categorized in such a way, there should  be no need for them not to be on the shelves at a library. if a certain type of music or book is known to be offensive, then that certain genre can be avoided. there is no need to even visit a section of the library if one knows that he or she finds it offensive.     in the @caps the @caps people are given many rights that are often taken for granted. the freedom of speech is one. it is a privilege that if taken away would tear @caps a part. the freedom to say what you please also includes singing. certain music that is on the shelves at a library does have the right to be there. just because a certain group of individuals finds the type of music offensive, does not mean everyone also thinks that way. for this reason any genre of music can sit on the shelves at a library.     another freedom given to the @caps people is the freedom of press. anything put onto paper is legal. criticizing the government or fantasising about school, it is all legal. books can be offensive to many people. they can persuade one in ways that is unbelievable. like music, books have many categories. whatever is put inside those books is allowed to be there no matter what.     movies are located at libraries as well. they are categorized just as much as books and music. the term ' @caps judge a book by it's cover' is true sometimes. this can also be used with movies. the title of a moive or book will tell what it is about. certain movies that are not meant to be seen by children are rated @caps or @num. these ratings help censor things to a certain extent. it is not illegal for a library to have a rated @caps movie. it is illegal however to check one out to a child of a young age.     censorship should not be allowed in libraries. all types of genres of all types of entertainment can be found in libraries. from books to videogames there are ratings and generes. if someone is offended by these types of entertainment they should not visit that section of the library. it is not illegal to have certain types of music, books, movies, etc inside a library. as long as no laws are being broken, there should be no problem.
3 censorship for the future kids of america.    personally i have read some disturbing books also watched some grotesque and twisted, disturbing rated @caps movies. not even talking about all the messed up music ive heard so far in my lifetime.    what it comes down to is alot of the music today is about sex, drugs, money, and violent crimes and gangs. the movies have a rating system which helps out for little kids. books any one can get from a public library and some are about murder, rape, gang, violence, and all the horrable reality of the devilsh deeds in the world.    i personally dont have a kid but if i had a kid and he read a book that was bad or heard a dirty song with some of those lyrics and if he watched a rated @caps movie i would wanna file a complaint because thats not how i want my kid growing up. with a twisted mind and a vocabulary of a little punk with curse words every ten seconds coming out his mouth. also i would'nt want my kid kissing his mom with that kind of stuff coming out his mouth.    but the @organization needs to keep all that stuff away from kids until there old enough to go get it on there own like they need to be @num to go see a rated @caps movie. that is how it should have always been.
4 in many @caps libraries across the nation, a numerous amount of: books, magazines, movies and music aren't provided because they are found offensive. i do not believe this should happen because everybody is unique and @month find different types of work offensive. who is it that chooses these items to be taken out of libraries and why should they be the only ones to say what goes and what stays?      everybody is different in their own way and everyone has their own interests and opinions. some people are athletic, gothic, preppy and nerdy. the library is open to anybody that wishes to enter. what happens if the people that choose what content is provided in the library, doesn't like scary books, so they take all of the scary books out? what if their is a person that only reads scary books? what then will they have to read? i bet if that person had the ability to choose what stays and what goes in the library, they would only have horror in the library. i do not believe that anybody should have the right to censor what content is provided in @caps libraries. everyone has their own opinion and interests so they should have everything open in libraries.     there is a reason that @caps libraries are called @caps. that means that it is open to anyone and everyone. there should be all kinds of different genres to read and all sorts of movies to choose from. just because one person doesn't like a certain kind of genre, or doesn't find it appropriate for a certain viewing audience, does not mean that they can take it out of a @caps library. that would be why there is such thing as sections in libraries. if you don't find a certain type of book appropriate, place it in the '@caps @caps' section of your library. for example: @person, he is a very popular author to many different viewing audiences. his ideas are very different than most. he writes horror but displays gore and a lot of sexual content in his writing. it is his own writing style. if the people that choose what is in the libraries, don't find that appropriate or if they find it offensive, they should put it in the '@caps @caps' sections or even the '@caps' section. it should be up to the childrens' parents what their kid is reading; not the library itself.     i do not believe that anyone should choose what is and isn't provided in libraries. everybody is unique, different and have their own opinions on different things and ideas. if you remove a specific type of book, movie, magazine or music from a library, and it's the only kind a certain person reads, what then will they have to read? what if somebody took out the kind that only you like to read? what then will you do? if everybody had the choice and right to do this, i don't think that anything will be left in libraries. all genres of everything should be available to the @caps. if you don't find a book appropriate, place it in the @caps @caps section of your library to still have it open to anybody. that would just be a big @caps to anybody who decides to pick it up and read it. you need to think of everybody, not just yourself.
4 taking 'offensive' books from the shelves of libraries is like taking away the right of speech.  there is not a point to it. people in this country have the right of speech. along with that comes the right to have your voice be heard.  an author's opinions @month be offensive to some but does that mean he or she should not have a voice?  writers get their ideas from somewhere society plays a huge role in what ideas these authors conjer up, taking these books away will not change the way people think and feel, and most importantly citizens of the @location have the right to make their own choices; that being if you don't like a book don't check it out.     writers @month state things that to some degree @month offend one in a million people.  others see it as freedom of speech and writing.  an author who writes a story that involves sex is not trying to extend their writing and thoughts to second graders.  but if a person has a problem with the way the author sees the world walking out their front door will show that same thing.  some books @month be fictional but that does not mean they don't get ideas from somewhere else.  society plays a big part in the ideas and thoughts of most writers.  so when they write a book that has 'inappropriate' actions in it they got it from the way people truly are in the world.       banning a book from the library that has a sex scene or provacitive language does not --by any means-- make the world stop having sex and saying curse words. kids are learning this through hearing their parents swear or their peers in class talking about sex.  reading a book about it will not change the fact that they are still learning about it in many other ways.  if the books that swear were no longer on library shelves society still will not change.  there is no perfect society.     setting a book on a shelf with offensive language does not cause harm to anyone.  if an idividual doesn't like the way an author expresses themselves through their writing that person should not check that author's books out from the library.  no single person is forced to read a book they are offended by.  getting rid of a book because of an unhappy parent does nothing but waste paper and intelligence. the library is not liable for the feelings of the readers.  if the reader does not like the book they are able to close it.  no one has glued their fingers to it.       many people in today's world would agree that banning books from our public libraries will not have as much of an effect as some would like it to.  banning books is an unknowledgeable thing to do to keep your kids from learning bad things.  society shows that the writers are getting their ideas from somewhere, taking these books away will not take away the way people think and behave, and if some one does not like a book they should not read it
4 i do agree with this topic at hand, some of the material that is being displayed on the shelves at our local library is inappropite or sometimes valgar. way too @month people get away with way too many things in this day and age. our society we live in is just a total wreck and complete, utter disaster. something has to be done to put an end to this madness.     someone would think that if a librarian put an inappropite book up on the self, that @caps is inevitable that a child or someone irresponsible would find the book. yet we still witness children reading or looking at a book, type of media, or entainment that is not suitable for their age group. sometimes adults find books that are not pleasing, why would we put them on a self to be publicly displayed? that is a question that i have yet to find the solution to.     i got home from school a couple of days ago and i heard this hip-hop music comming from my nine year old sister's room. i started to listen to the lyrics and they were absolutley awful, @caps was singing about drugs, sex, and alcohol. i went in her room and turned @caps off and questioned her where she got the @organization from. she replied 'the library.'     that's just another example of what i'm speaking about. if someone at the age of nine can check out a @caps.d. like that, then imagine what is avalible to me at the age of sixteen. adolessence do not need those kinds of thoughts and words in their vocabulary. i'm just afraid for the next generation; what are they going to be listening to? what are they going to be reading?     and @caps's not just the library, @caps's everywhere! we can't even live a day of our lives in this society with out hearing something bad on the radio, on tv, or even in public. everywhere we turn is something bad or valgar. so we need to think about ourselves and our children and try to clean up our acts a little bit. we need to stand up for what's appropite and what's right
3 going to the library is one of the best ways to explore new things. some items are not appropriate for everyone though. certain books, movies, magazines, and music should not be accessed by everyone. having an adult only section would be a way to solve this problem.     removing certain materials from the library would not be in good interest. any popular material should be available at the library. many best selling books would be wrong for children to read, but they would be perfectly fine for adults. that doesn't mean these books need to be taken out of the library. children should be restricted from viewing the explicit materials though. having a section in the library from which only adults can rent the items, would remove this problem. people under @num should also be restrained from looking through these materials. having a childrens' section in the libray would also keep them away from adult materials. the library needs to make itself user friendly.                people who frequent the library often pick up a book, not knowing what it holds. when inappropriate material is inside a child might innocently read into or see something they are not supposed to. parents should not have to worry about their kids seeing inappropriate pictures or text. they should feel safe letting their children look through all the books at the library. library workers should also make sure the adult materials stay in the hands of adults. allowing children and their parents to feel safe and welcome is an important part of the library.      taking adult materials out of the libray is not a good idea. it would lower its popularity. everyone has different interests, and they want to research them at the library. the safety of children is also important. making sure children cannot reach these materials is a concern. having separate adult and children sections could solve this problem. not allowing anyone under @num to check out explicit materials would also help. keeping the libray full of information but still safe for children is the ideal situation
3 in this world you never know what someone might writing. there're many materials in this world that i think aren't appropiate for someone to be reading, watching or listenning, ect.  you @month be thinking that anyone makes his/her own decision of what they read, watch, listen.  well, i do agree with that, but i do believe that some materials aren't rate it properly to age.  i do think that some materials should be banned from people under age, some from kids, and some from everyone.      you @month be thinking that all of this is wrong and that there is nothing wrong with books, music, movies, ect., but in my opinion some materials are just offensive and not proper. i seen so many materials that i think are not proper for people under age to been looking at. in some movies, for example, the rating is just not right because some movies have so much violence or language.  you might not think it's that big of a deal, of course, but i do. in my opinion, some materials are not too low in rating, and should not be for people under age.     it's not surprising to me that kids are now yelling, hitting, and or acting like a rebels to their parents. many of this things kids get it from books, music, movies, ect. this is many of the reasons some materials should be banned from kids.  you ask yourself why? well, first of all, kids are just learnning and they do everything they watch, see, or listen. i mean now kids don't even think about what their about to do.  they just do, they don't care, they think it's okay. i think that parents should be alert to offensive materials in the shelves, and should say something about it so they banned them.     why banned some materials from everyone?  well, first of all, why do we even want to watch, see, or listen to things that are not right? you @month be thinking that we just do it for fun and that it's enjoyable and nothing wrong with it. well, you @month be right but also wrong.  i certainly do agree with you, we all watched things for fun and to enjoy them, but some things are just too out of this world for us. why do people do crazy things now in these day? in my opinion, i think is because they mostly get it from books, music, movies, ect.  i think that if a book shows very offensive things they should be banned from everyone no matter what. it's the right thing to do.     if you don't want to see this world get more out of control than it already is. well, we need to do something about all these materials that are offensive and banned them for good.  we certainly don't want to see our kids yelling, hitting, or and actting like rebels to us. we don't want some crazy person coming to our hosue and do crazy things to us just because that's what they learn from those materials they had on the shelves.  it's come to me that some materials should be banned from people under age, from kids, and some from everyone
4 a place fill of knowleged should be a place where you can find all the news that is making the world what it is today, a person should be able to find out things from the past also. a library has many different things found in it: books, magazines, movies, and some have music. the books range from encyclopedia's to @person, the varity of books and information is to the extreme. but then again with all the good things there always comes a bad side of the information. with all the profanity found in today's society you would not want a child seeing or hearing any of it while at a public library.     books are put into a library so that people have the chance to read them and become more knowledgable. the thought of a younger person going into the older, adult area is very upsetting but then again who's to say that that individual is not allowed to read an article or magazine that has more mature type's of information or language found in them. i feel that a person will see what they want to see and what they want to read, fact of the matter is they have the right to.      both, young and older people need to be educated in the worlds past history and the present news. one reason being to prevent things that happend in the past, happening again. another reason is just so that they know what is going on around them and so that the individual is informed.      libraries should have banners or flaps up saying what is in a certain section of that specific area and people can make the decision to go over to those area's or not. things that are found 'not right' in one's eyes @month not seem so bad to anothers, it's all in personal preference. things should still be out for the public to read or see.     making the choice to go into a library is an individuals decision. fact is that the library is a place where a person should be able to get knowledge, no matter what type of information.  a person should be able to get their information without the censorship of others.
4 billions of books float from shelf to shelf each day: fictional and nonfictional, horror and comedy. writers reside in every part of the world composing works from complex life experiences to simple dreams. being an author, who has the right to freedom of speech, story plots become to have endless combinations. every reader seeks out a different style.          libraries contain books that tower to the ceilings, any kind, every kind. books are divided into their individual sections according to truth, kind and cover, each category holding about four options. the necessity for censorship should never be an option. writers compose for all sorts of people. for some to say what's 'right' or 'wrong' is not a legitamate reason for a piece of work to be removed from a shelf. if, perhaps, more books had ratings such as movies do, an @caps @num cubicle could be created instead of allowing young people to have access to such vulgarity. taking away the enjoyment for some readers, however, is unethical.          whether pertaining to books, music, magazines, etc., censorship is unnecessary. those who compose the entertainment should not have to worry about the content of their expression and/or interpretation. if the worry is concerning youth, parental guidance should be in affect. resulting in cancellation can affect those who relate to the source so it's important to consider all options. to each, its own.
4 what would you do if a woman walked into a library and started throwing a tantraum about how inappropriate a book was, and she wanted it removed from the shelves? would you just stare and wonder if she was crazy? would you think that this is a public place, and everyone has their own opinions? i believe that even if someone thinks a material in a library is inappropriate, the material should not be taken off shelves.     many people actually believe materials in a library are too offensive or inappropriate. unsurprisingly, libraries can't exactly do much about that except remove them from the shelves if absolutely nessessary. however, when you think about it, if everyone complained about a certain book being offensive, there would eventually be no more books! for example, i would not want my little brother reading @person books because some chapters @month contain a sex scene. however, my brother will eventually be older, and he'll be able to understand. if i would have gotten rid of that book, i wouldn't be letting other people enjoy it.     if you were to get books removed that were about @caps because you were @caps, many @caps wouldn't be happy to say the least. this could be about any subject matter, however. the more books that are removed from the library, the less people will know about the subject. eventually, as i've said before, there will be no more books left! everyone has their own opinion of what is appropriate or not, and everyone's views are different.     the solution to this problem is simply to not remove the books. sure, you might get complaints. but odds are, more people are unoffended rather than offended. americans do have the right to fight for this, but with the majority being unoffended, it's a tough case to win.     i believe all books would be fine left on shelves. if you take off one book, you might as well take off the rest. next time you are picking out a book, and you find it offensive, think about how other people might want to read it. they might even need the information for a paper they're writing for a class. you never know who might need the information. don't be selfish; keep the books on the library shelf.
4 a @caps is a place for people of all ages to come and get a book, magazine, music, movies and much more. libraries are a key essential to learning and helping those with reading skills. studies show that reading will make you much smarter and able to understand and comprehend well. however, in my opinion, offensive reading, viewing or listening material does not belong in libraries, to some extent.     as i stated earlier, libraries are a place of learning and for developing skills. books that are for 'adults' can be found in adult type stores or even at a regular local book store. parents bring their children to the @caps to support their reading ability and to advance it. they don't want to have to worry about making sure their kids are not looking at anything bad.      a few years back, i herd about a teenage boy that would go into the @caps about once a week to look for movies that this parnents would not approve of. later on that boy was caught and punished. if those kinds of movies were not there in the first place, his parents would not of had to worry about it. almost everywhere you go and everything to see and hear has some type of wrong background to it. parents should feel okay and worry-free when it comes to letting their kids do something as simple as going to the @caps. this problem can be easily fixed with removing that issue.      i strongly believe that @caps material should be censored in the way that those who should not see it, can not see it. on the other hand, material such as religious or cultural learning items that people find offensive should not be taken off the shelves. religious and cultural books, music, movies, and/or magazines are for those to learn. form what i have seen, someone @month want, for example, a book about @caps taken off the shelf because they are @caps and might not support their religious ways. i find this wrong because it is a free country that includes freedom of religion and they can't be denied informing others about that religion.     libraries are a place to feel safe and relaxed. everyone likes to sit in the @caps for hours and soak in a good novel. material that is found offensive does not belong their, unless it is for real educational learning.
4 i believe censorship is necessary. if all of the kids in the world grew up listening to hardcore gangster rap and watching porn @date we would have shiftless and violent leaders tomorrow. it's inmportant that we are held back some what by these offensive outlets in order that we grow into mentally healthy adults. however, censorship can go to far. when it comes to the removing an author's work from a public library altogether, we have crossed the line. with the @caps given us by our founding fathers, our @caps given to us at birth, and the duty we have to express our opinion, i submit that it is a crime to remove the hardwork of authors and artists from the shelves.     of course the first point of argument that comes to mind to defend my postion is the fact that we are all given a legal right to express oursleves through the @num amendment of our @caps of @caps. the writers of this @caps were aware that freedom of creativity should not be held back from the people. that law still exists @date and has been used many times to defend people arguing to keep their work, their words, and their ideas out in the world. as far as i know, taking any form of media, book, or entertainment away from the general public would be illegal. still, even with this point made, some @month not be convinced that we are allowed to say what we want.     a man by the name of @person comes to my mind when asked about censorship in the media. @person was a musician, composer, writer, public speaker, and human @caps activist. i think many people believe him to be a bit too wild and deranged to be a convincing argument. @person was known to be a firm athiest and secular humanist (one who believes that there is nothing more important than the physical human body), but he gave the same argument i'm giving @date, and i'm a catholic. @person spoke out against censorship, saying that it was a way to judge artists on their work when it wasn't even listened to fully. if someone as convincing and passionate as @person could feel that way when he didn't even believe in a @caps, then everyone should see that the human race, whether they believe in a @caps or not, is given the right for their creation to be revealed. in some cases, it's necessary and needed for people to show their ideas to the public.     @person, @person, @person even, and the list goes on. these people, although from different worlds and different times and different people, were all avid believers in the @caps of humans. imagine if @caps had just said, 'i don't think people want to hear me so i'll just stop and let someone else take over for a little bit.' do you think the world would by as amazing and of intergrated as a place? the point is, we never know how great and life-changing someone's point of view could be. whether it's leading a civil @caps movement, or attempting to bring peace to a world that needs it the most, censorship might be the one thing from stopping the people from seeing the most influential person that they need.  in fact, we are all called to share our ideas. it's our duty to make sure people see the world not only from their view, but from the view of a poor homeless man, and from a single mother of five, and from a kid in elementary school, and from a rebellious teenager. the world might not be ready for change, but it needs it.     who's right is it to judge an artist's work? some call him @caps, some call him the man, and others call him the government. it's hard getting your work acknowledged by someone, let alone a whole nation. however, that doesn't mean we are to just give up. censorship in public places is a crime against the law, nature, and our inaliable @caps, and it's our job to go out into the world to create a new one.
2 i think that only if there is real offensive stuff then it should be censored.  it is wrong to make fun of or joke about people. mocking a dissability like there have been  movies made doing. well actually, there is a movie i've seen before called the @caps and its a guy that made fun of a special olympic team, then lied about having a dissability to get money for racing and beating the team in races when he was totally fine.that would be something that i myself would want to take off shelves because there is no reason to mock a dissability.  i wouldn't know who decides what goes on shelves and what does not so maybe depending on what the offensive information is tells them something shouldnt be brought out
4 should we have censorship in our libraries?  this is a question that both sides can argue with creditable facts.  however, censhorship is mostly defined as not allowing certain items or things to be seen or heard of until a mature age.  how can you tell when someone is of a mature age?  maturity lies behind one's self to cope with various thoughts, ideas, actions, etc.  censorship should be allowed to an extent.     censhorship plays a big role in society today.  it has changed the content on our television from @num years ago to modern day.  the government is more leniant today then they were @num years ago.  on television @num years ago, you would never hear a sware word, or see a couple sleep in the same bed.  now, some sware words are considered okay, because people can handle them.  it is like they are part of our daily vocabulary now.  censorship has changed a lot.     books of all sorts should be allowed to children and adults of all ages.  certain literature provides a cornucopia of topics and subjects to be helpful to a processing brain.  we learn and understand at different rates.  some books with 'adult content' @month be suitable for more intelligent minds.  authors sometimes put in so-called 'adult content' to add suspense and drama towards the bigger picture or message behind their work.  books help the mind to expand and gain a higher standard of learning.     movies are differnent.  some movies have sexual content that our youth should not see.  most magazines have the same principles as movies do.  they are both rated differently on levels of age.  therefore, we can protect their innocence and fellow youth.  music is healthy to the mood of a person.  music should not be censored.  people just have different tastes in music.  some @month be fond of other genres and some @month dislike the other genres.  there is a wide array of music that people can enjoy.  there is no way to censor the universal language that music provides.     censorship should come down to what the adult allows for the kid to see and hear.  censorship of books is not fine, but censorship of movies and magazines are acceptable.  music, however, can not be censored.  the lyrics and sounds speak to many people in strange ways.  it is all helpful in the end.  everyone should have the right to watch, read, or listen to whatever they want.  it all comes down to learning, and there is no censorship on learning.  so, please do not censor our libraries.  allow the adults to censor what should be censored in their families
3 have you ever picked up a book, video, or music from the self and wondered why is this here, it's not a well thing for our younger kids to read, watch or listen to. i think that we should pluck out these types of books on our shelf at our libaray to better our community for our kids and their kids. we have all the right to voice our opion on things that we think should and shouldn't be in our libaray. books that promote sexual activity, killing people, using or taking drugs, and other harmful things, which isn't the best for our kids to read, listen to, or watch should be removed from our libaray shelf.     have you ever noticed how are crime rate and drug rate has went up in the past few years? these types promotes are in some of our books, videos, and other media. if we remove the videos, books, and other media that promote this kindof behavior we would have less of this type of crimes going on. i don't believe we would have all this crimes going on if we would remove this type of media because we all have a person we want to be like in a song or tv show or even in a book so we follow what they do, if they promote crime you try to act like them. we as humans follow the actions of others weither we think about it or not.     music also plays a big roll in this to, music containing bad laguage or promoting someone to take drugs or kill people, has been proven to play with our minds. would you as a parent want to see your kid raised up in a community that promotes sex, drugs, kill people, and other things that we shouldn't do? there's music we all like out there, we listen to what we like so that being, if we like rap for explain, if it promotes killing we are more likely to follow that action in the song because your mind thinks it's self out of it being a crime to kill cause you like rap music so it must be okay.     we @caps's in our community believe that we should abstian our selfs from this kindof behavior and we don't see to many drugs, killings, or sexual activity. the bilbe teaches us to stay away from things that promote drugs, killing, or sexual activiy, thus we don't see much of these behavoirs in a @caps home or community. @caps are more better off then lot's of us weither we want to aceppt that or not. they live a life after @caps, which don't promote all these behavoirs. and i know that @caps would be more willing to take out these type of media in our libaray. you can sit for one whole day and watch the actions of @caps and how they act they don't act like normal people as far as into drugs and stuff like that, only because they abstain their selfs from media that promotes sex, killing, and drugs.     now, if you want to help us make our community a better place for your kids and their kids, let's remove the harmful media in our libaray that promotes sex, drugs, and killing. i don't think you would want to see your kid doing drugs or killing people and messing up their lifes because you didn't help in removing this media. please help us better our community for our kids and their kids and the genrations to come after us.
4 in libraries there are some books,music,magaizines that are not very apporiate to put on shelves. there are little kids that will want to look at anything they can get their hands on. they are very mysterious when it comes to that.      there are bad books but there are also good books in the library. if people found a book or any type of material in the library and found it offensive, then they should take it off the shelf. there are children that look at anything they want or what they think looks interesting. the library also should at least check what the book is about when it arrives at the library. that way no one would have to worry about a material being offensive. movies should not matter really because there are a lot of bad movies but i dont think that people would find them offensive. they dont have to watch it and neither do their children.      there is a lot of bad music. i think there should be censorship on music because some music today is about drugs,alchoal, and violance. people would not want to see that in their local library for their children to see. i have seen on the news people get upset when they see something that they think is inappropiate for underage children. i would get mad too because i dont want an underage child to be listening to that type of music. children now look up to these song writers and want to become them. that is not a good thing at all.      all magazines can be offensive to people just by looking at the cover and who the cover person is. libraries would not put a inappropiate magazine on the shelves. there are some magazines that they have but they are good magazines even for children to read. i think that the libraries dont put offensive magazines out because they dont want any controversy. people today have came out even more good magazines for anyone to read that is not inappropaite for anyone.      i think some people today dont realize that the library would want to offend anyone by putting those offensive magaizines,movies,books and music. putting censorship on those things would be a good thing because there are materials that are not good for small children to read or hear or watch. the parents dont want their children looking up to a person who is involved in violence or drugs or alchoal. censorship would be they way to go on all those materials just to keep away contoversy and the children safe.
4 should libraries be more careful about what they put out in their place of establishment? of course they should. libraries have all kinds of people walking in and out everyday. certain rated material should be put in certain spots for certain people. the library should be more strict on the material that the people in the library look at on a day to day basis. libraries need to become a little more organized.     libraries have people that come in and out of the library everyday. people of all different ages and anyone is welcome to come in the library. with that being said, children of all ages come into the library all the time and pick all kinds of material. children of course can't read everything in the library. they have to stay within their appropriate rated material selection. so if the library is more censored and strict about the material children can't get their hands on the material that they shouldn't be seeing at that time in their lives. you would want your seven year old child seeing inappropriate or offensive material, right.      libraries should put the material that for adults eyes only in one completely different section of the library than what they would want the children that come to the library to see. with doing that it decreases the chances of the children getting a hold of material that they should see. also, some books that the library think that some children should be able to see just might be offinsive to another set of people and wouldn't want their children to see. so books @month show racism, or maybe another kind of discrimination and it @month not be the goal of the book to make that suggestion but it still is in the book and in the wrong hands it can be a very bad thing especially in some childrens minds.      the libraries really need to just stop and think for a second is this book really appropriate for this age group or even for this establishment. libraries have become where children are just checking out books by themselves and to me thats a problem. i think that children need a parents concent to check out a book from a library but do the libraries care, no. library @month check their inventory and notice a book @month be missing but guess what, by that time its already to late. children are able to just walk right out with books these days and know one will even think that they just took a book without checking it out. when children find a piece of material in a library and they know they aren't suppose to have it and they know they cant get out of the library with it they might decide to just take the book. the sercurity wont think twice to check the child and what is the result the childs mind is corrupted. guess what you can blame it on the though the library. isen't that something the child got the material from your friendly neighborhood library.     oranization is the key. libraries need to orginize their material better, plane and simple. it's really not that hard. they need to review the content that thier putting on the shelves in their establishment. i feel that the people at the library are lazy personally. if they just gave a little more effort maybe the children wouldn't get their hand on material that they have no buisness getting a hold of. just pay attention to whats going on in the library. their are books everywhere, right. their are children, correct. the children @month be in their appropriate rated section of the library but maybe a book from the adult section of the library stumbled over there by accident. though it was an accident it still happened and it can be prevented and it should be prevented for the sake of the children. all we need is a little more organization.     as you can see from the following libraries just don't about our children as much as we do. it's okay that everyone is welcome in the library no questions asked but, they people need to stay in the designated place in the library. children shouldn't be allowed in the adult section for saftey. also a book from the adult side shouldn't be in the childrens section because anything can happen and corruption will rise. we need stricter libraries. better sercurity to what they children are looking at and where the material is. also the library really needs to look at the material and decide if it is appropriate for all the readers that @month look at the material. organization is the key to all our worries, if we use a bit more effort this won't be a problem anymore.
2 we all don't think of anything when your children check out books from the libraries.                                                                                                                                                                                                but on the other hand, we do not want your children getting hold to the censorship of bad book, movie, music or magazines. parent don't want to come home an there child learn a new word from the new book or movie he/she just checked out from the libary, or reading a magazine from the libary. it might makes your children attitude change putting bad infleunce on your kid because of a trip to the libary. so there for the children should have a section where they pick out there book and they shouldn't be able to check out the censorship book.                                                                 we need to make sure our children be more convinced about this topic.
4 today, millions of teens are bombarded with all kinds of media garbage. this can range from exposure to certain movies, music, magazines, books, or to even commercials. parents, teachers, and even governments censor materials such as these to protect the students or the general population on topics that can be offensive or difficult to explain. however is that really the right choice?      in life, we cannot shut our eyes and pretend that there are not harsh concepts out there in the world that we have to face. in fact, our parents and teachers should prepare us to be fully equiped when we go off on our own to find our place in the world. this then begs the question is it okay to censor certain books from the shelves of a library which can potentially enlighten us as growing students? when one conceals information, that person is stealing the right of knowledge. not only that, but what one person finds offensive another can @month not. this topic is just too abstract to be regulated. for example, take what katherine paterson said about how if everyone decided to work in this manner, all the books in the world wouldn't be available to any of us.      therefore censorship in libraries should be condemned because we are only hurting ourselves in the long run when we limit the knowledge we decide to take in
4 libraries are filled with books, magazines, music, movies, and many more materials. all of the materials cover a really wide range of topics. for example, movies can be a comedy, mystery, or adventure. however, some of this material is not suitable for some viewers and can be very offensive to them. for this reason, these offensive materials should be removed from libraries.     one reason offensive material should be removed from libraries is because it can lead to violence in teenagers. if a teenager is continually reading books or watching movies that have violence in them, then they might think violent behavior is all right. they might not know that violence is not the answer to many problems, and they will not realize that there are other solutions to a problem.      one case that proves seeing offensive material can lead to violence occurred in a high school. a straight-a student got a grade she thought she did not deserve from a teacher. this student then painted her face white, put on red lipstick, and took a knife to the teacher's classroom during school. she then proceded to threaten to kill the teacher. she got the idea from the movie '@caps', and her costume resembled the @caps. some students in the classroom at the time called @num, and the police officers convinced the girl to put down the knife. maybe if she had not seen the movie she would not have threatened to kill her teacher.     another reason offensive material should be removed from libraries is because the material is sometimes inappropriate for younger children. the children might just be looking at books and magazines in the library and not even check it out. this way no one will know that they read it. some of the books in libraries have subjects like sex and drugs in them. when the child reads this, he might want to do everything that is in the book. i have  read a book that contains sex and drugs. the book might put awful ideas into the child's head if he read it.     after all is said and done, offensive material should be removed from libraries. the material can lead to violent acts in people, even if it does not seem like that kind of behavior could possibly come out of that person. the material can also be inappropriate for younger children. all in all, material in libraries can be offensive to some people.
4 today it seems as if anything you could imagine is out in the world somewhere, somehow. whether it is found in a magazine, a book, music, or movies is irrelevant. the fact of the matter is, if good stuff is out there, then you can generally make the assumption that bad stuff is out there too. this bad stuff is sitting around on the shelves of our libraries nationwide waiting for someone to open it up and induldge in their naughty, intense, or graphic ways.      as an @caps, every man has the right to do or read what he wants. but what happens if it is not a man at all but in fact it is a child? this child is not choosing to read such bad things but just so happens to stumble upon it. should they be punished for accidentally coming across this material and reading it? which raises the question; who is to blame, and, what is the solution? it is a good and respectable idea to censor certain things in libraries but if someone wants to read something, they should be able to right? it is a very sticky situation and determining the answer should be a long and thought out process examining the issue from all angles, and different perspectives.      the people that have brought this issue to the surface more than likely have personal experiences that make them feel so strongly on thier views of censorship in libraries, as have i. on a dry, blistering @date day i wanted to find something to do indoors. so instead of staying home all day i walked down to the library. i had been there a lot that @date and i was pretty familiar with their selection so i was looking for something new. so i strayed out of the kid section and browsed other areas of the library. there were so many choices and options right at the tip of my fingers. i got tired of reading all the titles so i did what generally any other kid would do, and something parents have been telling their kids for centuries not to do; i judged the books by their covers. i found one that looked interesting, and long story short i just so happened to stumble upon a love story. but not the kind i was used to. it was an adult book and want into vivid detail about the relationship of a sexually active older couple. needless to say i was speechless. reading that stuff as a child, scared mevery much so.     nevertheless it leads me to believe that it would be smart for censorship to be put into place in libraries. of course, not every kid is going to have the same experience i did. in fact hardly any will. but i know that i was traumatized. so i can easily imagine how other people felt when the same thing or a realitively similar thing happened to them. but for all the other people that have not had things happen to them or that have not stumbled upon such material would probably think that it is unfair that things should be taken away from them just because other people could not handle it. but if you were like me, or any other innocent child that happened to find and experience certain things they just were not ready for would you not agree that censoring libraries is a beneficial thing to everyone? if you want things that are more intense or out there, then you can go to a bookstore, instead of a public library.     i am a teenager and i do not have children but i can only imagine how you mothers and fathers out there would feel if it was their kids who were emotionally scarred from experiences they could have been shielded from in the first place. kids should be kids and not have to be worried about the bad things in this world, and the most effiecient way to keep that the way it is, is to censor books, music, magazines and movies from the shelves of public libraries.
3 i believe that certain materials,such as books,movies,magazines,etc, should not be removed if they are offensive to others because censorship and libraries has their own rights to have what they want on their shilves.yes you @month say that some things are unapropriate for children to see but there is an children side of every libraryso that children would not have to see unapropriate things.i feel as thought that no one has the right to tell another store where to locate their things.       also i can understand where the author is coming from but you would have to understand there is people oput there in the @location that would like to read or listen to unapropiate things that parent would not allow there children to see or listen to.i would also consider that @caps, @caps dont let your child or children attend that library or that certain place where you know there is despictable materials there.everyone has their own personal right to place there things where they want them to be.     there are many other options,@caps can order their books online or go to the library with their child.when i was a young girl my mom never let mee go anywhere along so i never had to worry about seeing anything unapropriate or affensive.now a days in @date children know right from wrong.children know what they suppose to read and does not.       i do also agree if a librarian or an adult see or hear children looking or listening to something i they know they should not be,they should stop the child or converscate them from the premises.         so no i do not agree with you.i still think that people should have the right to place there things where they want because it is their stuff and their property.
4 everybody had their favorite movie, song, or book when they were younger. sometimes these types of media aren't exactly child friendly. songs today hint at sexual activities. books about scary vampires and werewolves are being published. there are even movies that depict violent and inappropriate behaviors in which children should not witness. does that mean they should be limited by a public place, such as a library?  several people would agree, but i disagree.          growing up, @person was the wonder of my world. her music was fun and unbeat, making a sunny day even more enjoyable. her lyrics seemed like they meant nothing, until you thought about it a little more deeply. even looking at the music videos, they show actions and images little children shouldn't be copying. some @month restrict their child from such material, but i would call that depriving a child of there freedom.           you can go to any public library and look through numerous selections of books, dvd's, cd's, and even magazines. some library's even have computers available to the public. not all places will carry your favorite aritist, movies, or reading material tho because they believe it isn't something little children should be indulging in. who is to say a little kid can't enjoy the material that they'd like? that's like taking away part of a person's originality. a child would not have the opportunity to become an individual with their own opinions and feelings if they were restricted to a one mind track.          limiting a child's media could benefit them in some way. restricting time on computers, limiting the amount of hours playing video games or watching television could help teach a child time managment skills. most children will see something interesting and repeat what they learned or share it with an adult and it could get them into trouble. library's shouldn't have to take the offensive media off the shelves though. age restrictions on renting those offensive types of materials should be set.           just because a book or movie has language and images that shouldn't be seen by children is made, does not mean a library should limit that access to the public. restrictions on renting that material could be set. it would solve all issues, in my opinion. in conclusion, censorship in public library's could be beneficial, but they should just set an age renting limit instead of removing all material alltogether. therefore, making parent's happier and not restricting a person's freedom to develop there own opinion's and liking's of the different types of media
4 everyone is @caps          @caps person is @caps, this much we can agree on. so why then would people try to put a censorship on books, movies, magazines, and etc., as i pointed out before, we all are @caps so we all have @caps standards on what is bad and offensive to what is good.     when we remove a book from a library shelve for whatever reason we have to do so then others should have the same right to do so as they see fit. if  picked up a book on why @caps is the right religion and i am a @caps then more then likely i will find it offensive. yet if i gave that same book to a @caps, that person would mostly likely read that exact same book that the @caps read and find it not offensive at all. it all comes down to the veiws we all have about everything so why would you let one person or even a small comittee set standards on library censorship for they @month feel one way while another comittee or person feels completly @caps. everyone is @caps and feels diferently about issuses. there is no way to make sure that @caps book in the library won't offend a single person.     the same issue can be applied to music, movies, magnazines and ect. no matter what we do, some one will be offended. for example, the plege of allegiance is something my school says everyday, yet some people, like a @organization, find it offensive. all acrosss the nation people say it before school, a sportinh game, or ect., yet you don't see very many people objecting to that. i have obsereved that most people who find it offensive just ignore it so why can't we do the same for books, movies, magazines, and etc. that we @month find offensive.     in conclusion, there really is no way to put a cencorship in libraries since no matter to tell what a person might or will find offensive. so why then can't we just not read what offends us, this really is the only way to keep from offending  people. for these reasons, i feel that there should not be a cencorship in libraries
5 censorship is a matter of great contention today. many authority figures have seemingly become obsessed with the notion that literature, video games, movies, and music are responsible for the perceived corruption of today's generation. many believe in the idea of censorship because it will protect their children and allow them to remain innocent and morally upright. however, i believe censorship is a grand mistake on our part. denying children access to certain literary works only keeps them ignorant, not innocent; so many books today are censored, and yet the information contained in them could have been vital to children who are seeking an understanding of the world they live in.     one of the most difficult questions about censorship is the matter of what should be censored and what should not. books that are viewed as offensive or controversial are the usual targets, but viewing something as being offensive is just thata view. it changes from person to person because of varying cultures, religions, and moral codes. no one can agree on what will have a negative impact on children, making it impossible to establish a standard of what is best left off the shelf. the problem this creates is that many valuable books that should be permitted reading material are instead unavailable.     censorship can protect a child from information they are better off not knowing, but it also robs them of a chance to gain vital knowledge. children should be encouraged to read and to learn, not blocked from doing so. yet if this is truly the case, why does the censorship debate still rage?     the argument continues because, in truth, there really are things that ought to be censored. movies, music, and even books today can be very violent or sexual in nature, and these inappropriate subjects can have a negative impact on youths. bloody video games and hateful song lyrics can encourage animosity towards others in children. but that cannot be the sole cause of such behavior; children will act right if they are taught how, not if they are hidden away from every instance of wrong. censorship is greatly inferior to proper life lessons about morality, equality, peace, and respect.     inevitably, censorship will remain a common practice. but try this: think of a book that changed your life for the better, and then imagine if you had been denied access to reading it. do you want to let your children miss out on an experience that could very well mean the world to them?
4 censorship in media has been around since the beginning of @organization. some of the first movies were seen as too offensive and never made it to the theatres, but books, music, movies, and magazines in libraries how do they even need to be censored?          censorship of books should be if a book is not for children keep them away from it. books that are extremely offensive should be taken off the shelf or not put in a library. a library is a place of learning or reading for entertainment and those very offensive books do not teach learning or are entertaining.          music is another thing. most songs out are highly offensive and should be in a different section. they should not be in the kid's area for music because do parents really want their children to learn cuss words at the age of five? most parents do not want their children to learn cuss words and probably like if the libraries got rid of the music altogether that had to with sex, drugs, and cussing, all things that are censored in the media today. maybe libraries can carry music that is censored instead of carrying music that is not censored.     movies are almost the same as music because it potrays mostly what music has in it, but it is visual. again parents do not want to see drug use or inappropriate gestures that make the child copy what they see and hear. libraries should put the movies in the adult section of the library. they should be censored by putting a censor bar over the mouth of someone who is cussing or put the bar over the person's hand or wherever when they are making an inappropriate gesture.     over the years it has become harder to censor magazines. magazines are impossible to censor, unless you are the person receiving the magazine. if you are the libraries receiving the magazines grab a black marker and cross out words or pictures that seem to be offensive. the libraries should not carry the inappropriate magazines.     if you are at a library and you see something inappropriate tell the librarian and see if they will censor the material in question.
4 as katherine paterson once said, 'all of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.' as an author, she feels if she, and anyone else, has the right to take those uncensored books off the shelf, then there will be no books left. depending on the person, some books @month be offensive to some, but not all. i dont think that books should be able to be taken off the shelf by anyone because everyones preference on books can be different. i believe that libraries should keep unsensored books in a certain section, so children can easily be kept from seeing or reading unappropriote material at their age. and lastly, my own experience has led me to believe there should be a warning on certain books, saying not all the material could be appropriote.     people having the right to take any book off the shelf would be unfair for the people. the library is a quiet place, meant for people to come and read any type of book, do homework, study groups, and undergo research for practiaclly any topic, @caps the number of books based on one persons opinion is unfair to everyone else who might enjoy that genre. libraries and books were one of the main resources for researching before there was internet and many eople still prefer books to this day. i think the freedom of taking any book off the shelf would be endangering the process of learning and discovering     to reduce the number of uncensored books being found by children or people who find them offensive, there should be a certain section in the library for just those books. that way, people who have an interest in those books can read them, but also they are kept away for those who dont want to read them. i think taking away any type of book is unfair to the people because everyone like different genres of books, so having uncensored books in one section is fair to all. it would also be easier on parents knowing their children wont find books with material in them that they shouldnt be reading.      by disagreeing with the right to take any book off the shelf, i think each book with any uncensored material should be marked with some type of sticker on the binding, just as a warning. if one sees that sticker and knows they dont want books with that type of material, then they can easily return the book with no argument. i have had experience with trying to find a book for a school project, but later finding there was material in it that really wasnt appropriote for school. this made me have to find a new book for the project. i didnt want to completely take the book off the shelf and away from any one else who wanted to read it, but a warning right then would of been easier in the situation.      in conclusion, i dont believe that certain materials should be taken off by just anyone. taking away books would spark many disagreements because even though one person might find something offensive, doesnt mean every other person will. as mentioned before, putting the uncensored books in a different section and putting a sticker on the binding would give a clear warning to anyone not wanting to read unsencored books. i think every library needs to take into consideration of the topics above to help people reduce the issue of people or children finding uncensored books in just any section
3 books are to be read not taken off beacuse of what they say. that to me is stupid are childern live in world of war and fear everyday what is a damn book gonna change? nothing there gonna hear the f word and see blood and gore. would you rarther them see it for the first time in real life and not know what to do.      music is one thing that can bring everybody together. so by are childern not being able to hear some of them lyrics then we are pushing them into being pussys. maybe there just some real people teelling the truth that you dont want your kid to hear.     movies are something that people love to watch come on we pay @money to get onto see them sometimes. are kids are gonna be better because there parnets didnt want them to see the new horror movie there gonna see in real life one day why not now?     parnets your not doing us a favor by not letting us see the real world your @caps us @caps because when we get into that sitituation in real life we arent gonna know what to do then were scewed.
3 books, music, movies, and magazines have been taken off the shelvs.we are forever more blocking or cesoring these items. reasons why iot is a good idea is because their are children parents and religeous people who are so agains some of the thngs that are brodcasted if you want something uncensored then you can buy or rent an unrated version.          children are our future, why would you carrupt a mind so young and innocent? if your child is one second watching @caps and happy as can be and the next watching people being killd and the @caps bombs being droped that will forever be threre in his or hers mind. i dont think you would be to happy if your child was piucking up valgure language from the @caps or @caps. picture it your @num year old talking to you and then says an innappropreate word not knowing where it came from you just ignor it then that vacabulary grows into words and sentances much worse turning thins child into a bit of a potty mouth maybe even violent. we dont want our future presidents and authorities to be so violent that they put the woukd in danger just because they got if off the @caps do we?            parents have the right to watch what they want but also have the authority to put a stop to what they dont want them and their @caps to view or even hear.more families these days enjoy taking car rrides together and vacations watching @caps and listening tgo the @caps as they go one minute they are all singing happy as can be unti a song with a bunch of innopproppreate words come on its not only dissrespectful but embarrasing to listen to your kids sing along to it. parents dont want to listen to that so they turn it off  everything is fine until they hear them again singing to their music divices @caps,@caps,@caps, bombs all around the car their is no escape thats when parents should have a say to what their children are not only watching but listening and reading also. books about @caps @caps and @caps are not something an @num year old should be reading we dont need them to be a bunch of stoners parents eaither. one minute you think you are reading a book about love and rommance next you read that the character is smoking a joint.         people with strong religeouns dont want to be watching @caps late at night and then be watching on @caps gut that @caps is doing @caps and sleeping with all these girls yes it @month be funny to those non believers but to those who have a relligion it is just dissrespectful . then listening to music hearing about people with no religion them lighting fires to crosses and using valgure language and the lords name in vein.not something they want to hear. when it comes to reading a book the religious have a strong oppinion on what should be read so they usually stick to the @organization but whjat happens when their kids go to school to fiind a fake @organization with nothing but lies and dirty pictures in it?       @caps shows, music, books, and magazines should always be censored it not only gives a good  example for everyone but it helps us as a community to stay strong. not being violent or cursing after everything you say is not going to hurt anyone. why would you want a future president to be a violent killing machine?  the environment we grow up in is how we turn out @caps, @caps, and @caps being read about or heard is not the way to be
4 what happened to everyone having the right to have freedom of knoledge? i do not believe that certain materials should be removed only for the reason that someone finds it 'offensive' or 'inappropriate'. our youth have the right to access these materials. kids should have that right because it allows more access to knoledge, it provides more realistic details about life, and keeps them from being shut out from the world around them. we cannot deprive children of that.     first of all, all children and students at schools all over should have access to more knoledge. if certain materials are censored and taken away, they cannot access that type of learning. what if a student wants to learn more about how goverment and politics work by reading an an article. but then, the article is taken away because of one small comment in it. we cannot take away our aspiration to learn more about the world.     secondly, it can give a more realistic image of a person, place, thing, or event. explicit content can give children more details about how things really are in life. if that is taken away, they might have a different understanding of how things really are and have different expectations of things. this might have an emotional or psycalogical impact on them once they see the real world. they should be well informed of what life is like in further detail to avoid confusion once they get to that point.     finally, they could be shut out from the world if everything is kept from them because of censorship. being kept from that kind of knoledge can be an emotional strain. a friend of mine had parents that kept her from many things in the world around her, blinding her from what she should have known. as she got older, things became harder and harder for her. and now, she is affraid of many things out in the real world. this is all because her parents had used cencorship to keep her from knowing what was important.      our students should always have access to knoledge, details about life, and not kept from knowing enough to have an undertanding of things in our modern world. we cannot allow censorship to make such irrational descisions about what we do and do not have access to. and if it has such a negative impact on society and our youth, why isn't it censored
3 what if one day you took a trip to the library, and you came across a book that was offensive? would you ask for it to be taken off the shelf or just ignore it? every year tons of @caps visit libraries in search of a good book, threw act of observations and personal appeal. everyone has a different choose in the types of books they'd like to read, with that comes offensive and non-offensive material.     being a teen i've had some experience visiting the library where things come across as offensive to me more easily than others but like many i choose to ignore it. reasons for ignoring it are rather simple, everyone has different takes on things in which they've gathered since birth as we'll as personal life experiences. because, everyone has different life experiences comes different views on what offends them or not. personal experiences i've had in the library are from race seeing books that relate to the days of slavery @month be offensive to me. but, a book on the black panther organization maybe offensive to someone else. so, does that mean it should be taken down off the shelf because it is offensive to both people?     books have diffent tones weither its on life, politics, or worldly issues that make different people feel different ways. i've observed plenty of times where someone feels uplifted from reading a book. where someone else reads the same thing and feels terrible. take a magazine for instance, one reader could look like that beautiful women in that magazine and feel great about themselves. while maybe an overweight reader could read the same magazine and feel like there not beautiful or self worthy as the women in the magazine. that overweight women could feel offended, while the other women feels amazing, because of that simple reason it shouldn't be taken off the shelves due to different views of what offends them and what doesn't.     everyone reads books due to there liking and what relates to them. if a book, magazine, or movie comes across as offensive then that reader probably won't pick it up to find out more about it. when i come across material in a library that is offensive to me i won't read it. although i have picked up books that didn't come across as offensive, but after reading the material come to find out it was offensive. in response i simply returned the book and chose another one.     if i walked into a library and saw a book that was offensive to me i wouldn't ask for it to be taken off the shelf i would simply ignore it. everyone has different views on what offense them so there's not much you can do except just ignore it. if the case was that if a book were to offend someone and it was taken out of a library due to just that there would be no real need for a library
3 communities have many different types of people that live in them. certain groups of people find some things offensive while others find them totally nomal. some of these things cause conflict. a library, for example, is one place you @month find some of these conflicts.     most libraries are open to the public. therefore, many different groups of people will be sharing the material in the library such as books, movies, magazines, and music. having many different kinds of people sharing this material, the libraries must try to have material to please everyone. this is where the conflict begins. while trying to please everyone, some people @month find some of the material offensive. now for the big question: should material some find offensive be removed from the shelves all together?     the answer to this big question is no. libraries must have many different kinds of materials in them to please everyone in the community. people are different and believe in different things. just because one person finds some type of material offensive doesn't mean it is offensive to everyone. for example, things such as religion. someone @month find a book on a type of religion and find it very offensive, but others @month strongly believe in that reigion. just because one person takes it offensively, doesn't mean those who don't should have it taken away from them.     libraries are for all kinds of people. just because one person finds the material offensive, doesn't mean it should be taken away from everyone else. if libraries took any material that anyone found offensive in any way off the shelves, there would be no material left. people believe in different things. that is the way it always has been and more than likely, the way it will always be
4 i beleive censorship is a good thing; to an extent. i think that censorship deals with an age group and the permission of the parent(s) or guardian(s). if a consumer is the age of twelve and under; then the consumer should buy the censored books and etc., but, if you are thirteen and above you should be able to buy product uncensored.     some people do not like censored products because they feel it takes away from that particular thing. music, for example, alot of people get angry when the song lyrics on a @caps are censored. it does not allow the people to get the full effect of the music and the 'message' that the artist or band is sending.     with books; people get upset because they cannot get the full aspect of the book. censoring a book is like taking away part of a masterpiece. some books should be censored like alot of romance novels; those get pretty graphic and go into alot of detail with sexual themes and content. i do not think those books should be on the shelves.     in magazines; it depends on the type of magazine the consumer is reading. if a person is reading a politcal magazine; those magazines do not put all of the true facts and details into them for certain reasons. if a person is reading a hunting or fishing magazine; then they can put in all the facts on the guns, calls, lures, and stories they want and do not have to censor them.     movies, on the other hand, are censored on certain channels. if you are watching a movie on a @caps network like @organization or @caps; those channels censor movies. if you watch movies on @organization or @caps they do not censor the movies because those are movie channels only. that is also why movies have ratings. r is for restricted to people under seventeen (without an adult present) , @num is for people of the ages sixteen and under without an adult. and @caps and @caps are fine for any age group.     all in all; censorship depends on what age group the consumer is in really. if you are still in elementary school you probably should not be able to buy uncensored products; if you are thirteen to about fifteen, you should be able to buy the product with permission from an adult, and if you are sixteen and older you should be able to buy the products uncensored with out an adult present because you know you can handle the 'offensive' matierial
3 have you ever walked into a library and saw a book that you wouldn't what your child or any young one to pick up and read? there is several book in the library that young children should read. i don't believe that you a certian book should be removed from the library because it is offensive to some or not suitable for children, but there is a few things that can be done to keep those books away from your kids or any child. the possable things that could be done is; move those book to a higher shelf, designate a certian area for those books, or put an age limit on those books.     the first way that you could keep an offensive book out of your childs, or any other childs hands is to move those book to a higher shelf. doing this will keep those books out of your childs sight and reach. that will keep them out of childens hand, and prevent them from reading them.     the next possability to keep offensive books out of your childs or any childs hand is to, designate a certain area for those books in the library. doing this will provied a 'barrior', so that you could tell your child to stay out of that area, and keep a watch on them to make sure they don't go in that area. you would also know where those books are so the you could make sure they don't go to that area.     the final possability to keep offensive books out of your childs or any other childs hands is to put an age limit on those book to keep the children from being able to check-out those books, to read them. this would make the childen have be a certain age before the can check them out, preventing them from reading them.      these are a few possabilities that could be used to keep offisive books out of childrens hands, and preventing them from reading those offensive books that you wouldn't want them getting a hold of and reading
4 i do not believe that books, music, movies, or magazines should be removed from library shelves if they are found offensive. first, you have to consider what is offensive to most people, and who should be the people to determine if it should be sensored or not. people should be able to decide for themselves if they can or cannot get an item off of a shelf, because they might not even consider it offensive. if you are a parent, you have the right to not let your children watch or read certain materials, but you can't get it taken off the shelf because then it prohibits other people from being able to get that same material that they think is acceptable.      things that are offensive range from cussing all the way to extreme violence. some people @month not mind that there are a couple of bad words or a little violence, but others will find it very offensive. in my personal experience, i tend not to think that a little cussing is offensive, but i do know some people who balk even hearing one minor cuss word. many movies nowadays are made up of content that is mildly offensive, but only if you take it seriously. the movies make fun of things that people might find offensive, which probably offends those people even more, but they do not have to watch it if they don't want that movie! it just depends on the person and what they have grown up around, or what they think is right or wrong.      it is either your own responsiblity or a parents responsibility to determine whether the content of a book or movie is appropriate. many times parents use the argument that children are too young to make the judgement on a book or movie, and that is very true. so most children movies and books are appropriate, and do not include content that children are not quite ready to handle. if you are older, then you can probably make the decision to read or watch something because it is more appropriate for your age. many times you have already been exposed to the ideas prevalent in books in movies because those things are already in your life. it comes down to who the movie is for and what content you think is appropriate for their age.      the idea about taking these books off the shelves would be disastarous. the reading lists in schools would have to be cut down because parents didn't approve, and the children would lose valuable knowledge that is in most literature. one person could want to rent out their favorite horror movie and suddenly it would not be there because a couple of people thought it was offensive. there would be nothing left in libraries if one person did not approve of something because then every item would have at least one person disapprove.i once read to @caps a @caps, and our teacher told us that in another state this book had been banned because a couple of parents didn't like one or two things from the book. this book has many valuable ideas and lessons, and is considered a great piece of literature. these parents wanted the book to be banned from all schools, and all libraries all over the country, and that would be infringing on other people's rights of freedom of speech. the parents can say what they want about the book and not let their own child read it, but they cannot stop that opportunity for everyone else who wants to read the book. taking it off the shelves would be taking off those ideas as well. literature and every other movie and type of literature is what shapes a culture. there have been so many movements over time, many started with literature and it affected the culture and the people. censorship would just take away a part of our culture, which would be devestating.      you should look at your own life, and think about what you find offensive. then step into someone else's shoes that does not think it is offensive, and see if it is worth it to take it all away from everyone. almost everything could be considered offensive to at least one person, but it is your own resposiblity to decide whether it is appropriate for you or your child. the shelves should stay full of books, movies, music and magazines. it is our way of expressing freedom of speech, and that is an integral part of our country and our culture
3 censorship     no,i dont think they should take certin book off the shelves, there are alot of thing out there that can be found offensive; gangs, politics, race, even school that small children go to.      i can understand wanting to shelter your children, but you cant keep them from every thing. inner cities have gangs that right awfal words on trains, building, and about anything they possible can. an you cant just take that off the shelf.     politics can be the worst, during presidentual elections they are always bring up there color of skin, and about everything they can find out about the other person. all of your kids watch this on tv.     race wars can get bad, people all around the world are fighting just because the color of there skin. you cant him them from it either, its an on going battle that will never be one and it will keep getting worse.     i cant speak for other schools but mine has a lot of little problems; little kids cussing, the older kids fighting, then there are the people that try to do good in school and get picked on for it.      you cant hide you kids for ever, sooner or later they will find out about these problems. if you want to help your kids keep them off the streets because reading it in a book is alot better than them seeing it in the real world. you have to prepare them for the problems ahead, and if you dont then they might  get hurt alot worse than the little words in a book or a magazines or movies.
4 what is censorship? many would say it's a book without cuss words or it's a movie without racism. for me, i think censorship is covering up the truth. i don't think movies or books should be taken off the self because some people find it offensive. when a book uses a cuss word to show anger or simply use the word, i think that it's okay because isn't that what we hear in the world already? now i know some people @month not have grown up hearing foul words but many of us have.      with movies i think that if people have a problem with their children watching something bad or offensive then they shouldn't let their kid watch it. thats whats wrong with people now a days, they don't want to take blame for things that go wrong in their lives. people use censorship as a way to make themselves feel like their a good parent or that the world owes them something.      when it comes to someone thinking that a movie or book has gone to far with their race then censorship gets thrown around. many people have issues with their race or nationality being messed with. though it's funny to see that race use those foul words among themselves but when it's in a book it's racism. or when a certain race is being made fun of or shown in a movie in a way that that race doesn't feel comfortable with, that movie is called racist.      i feel that if people have an issue with something they don't agree with, then they should take it out of their own lives. too many people try to control something, like cencorship. for years now people have wanted books that are read in school to be censored for bad language. why put all that time toward the book being censored and not the school. i know kids in school use foul language all the time. even worse then the books we read. if adults would realize it's their kids they need to censore and not the books then censorship wouldn't have become such a huge issue. people need to just realize that by cencoring the books or movies doesn't make the offencive words or bad images go away, it just covers them up
3 i think if its offensive it should not be avavible for kids intill they are old enough to read it, listen to it. i think they need to be removed from shelves or put away.     because it can be hurtful, dirty for younger kids and it could be prevented if they are removed from shelves.     i belive the magazines can be put away or put into its own sections. music or movies could be put in there own sections also. internet could be blocked for certain websites.     luckly the time we live in has people to prevent these things to happen like adults. and people to watch you and can tell you you are too young for that stuff.     this is what i think it could be easily prevent just put them up or removed and taken off shelves. if they are offensive remove them so we dont have to worry if are children are reading them or not.
4 some people believe that certain materials, such as books, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. however, i do not believe they should be removed. people are mature enough to be able to handle offensive material. most people check out books or movies that they have heard about, so for the most part they know what they are reading @month be offensive. instead of removing the ofensive material, there should just be a warning to let readers know that what they are checking out is considered offensive.           these days, people are mature enough to read offensive material. we see many types of offensive material every day. examples of this inlcude when we watch the news, we @month see numerous offensive pictures or videos. there are also many news stories that many people consider offensive. when a person checks out an offensive book, they are doing so because they want to. libraries should not revoke a reader's right to read what he/she wants.           before a person checks out a book or movie, they should look into it to make sure they are okay with what they are getting. this can prevent many problems. for example, say a young reader sees a book that they think looks interesting. if they don't read into it a little bit and just take it home, they @month later find that it contains offensive material. however, if they read a little bit about it before they check it out, they will find out it contains offensive material, and can then make the decision on whether or not they still want to read it.           there are many ways libraries can prevent children or other people not mature enough to view the offensive material from seeing it. they can put a warning label on the book or movie to inform people that that particular item is considered offensive. libraries could even put an age limit on checking out offensive material. either of these ideas could be an efffective way to ensure that only mature people are checking out anything that is considered to be ofensive.     libraries should not have to remove books, music, movies, magazines, etc. that contain offensive material from the shelves. if a person wants to check out a book that is offensive, they should be allowed to check it out and read it. also, people should be intelligent enough to look into whatever item they are checking out before hand so they can be aware of the offensive material. however, to make things even easier, libraries could just put a warning label on offensive material to prevent some people from reading it.
4 censorship in libraries today, i believe, are not a big problem. but many would disagree with that. books and movies can be a very important resource for anyone of any age. they can gives us facts about a certain topic that we @month not find any where else. everyone has thier own definition of offensive. i belive that it is not only up to the library to rate the books, movies, and magazines offensive but it is also up to the participants using these resources.      for many kids, no matter what age, they only rent books from a library for two main reasons: pleasure and projects. to sensor a book from a teenager or child is just like more of an invitation to see whats inside of it. for the people who do pleasure reading they most of the time stick to only one type of genre. if someone wanted to rent a book, and it was not appropriate for them to read, then the librarian or teacher would restrict that book from them. for projects, such as for school, it would depend upon the librarian to censor the book to a child. but books are not rated such as movies are. so it really all depends upon the use of the book and the maturity of the person who is renting it. if they feel that it will not be appropriate for some, then they could give a suggestion to censor it.      movies and books are different in many ways. books allow you to create a mental description and picture in your mind for what you are reading. movies, on the other hand, create a visual image right in front of your eyes. no matter how gruesome or vile of a description a book can give, it still does not compare with the visual picture of a video. movies are rated today as to the age of a person, and they say why they are rated as such. movies rated above the @num level are most of the time not held in libraries. they @month still be censored if they create too vile of an image, but that is up to the one who watches it.     music is a major part of each one of our lives, and without it the world would be a much different place. everyone finds themselves quite fond of a certain genre of music, and most of the time sticks to it. music, like movies, is also rated by the content of the song. if it has a word or two that should be sensored, then it is most likely already labeled 'explicit'. i think that music, just like movies, should not be able to be censored, because they are already rated accordingly.     some books, magazines, and movies contain cold hard facts about the past years of our world and are too vile for anyone. and even though those events are in our past they are still very important to our present. books can be a magical place for children, as well as adults, to go and create their own world. to censor a book, movie, or magazine would be taking away that chance for someone to enjoy life just a little bit more for that small moment in time.
4 censorship in libraries     have you ever came across something in the library that makes you say, ' @caps! that's inappropriate!' if so, i am sure your not alone. just the other day i was in the library. there were posters up all around featuring a new movie now avalible for rental. i remembered seeing ads for this particular movie on television that looked rather repulsive. how could they allow this kind of thing on display like this? how does this affect the minds of our country's youth?     my thought on this topic is clear, although i am sure i'd recieve some opposition from others, considering everyone has their own opinions on this matter. i do realize the library has age limits on rentals, but what about all these posters everywhere? you don't necessarily have to rent the material to be corrupted by it. i believe there should be a separate section for this kind of material.     another example of library rentals that can be harmful to developing minds are @caps. new music sometimes contains lewd or inappropriate lyrics that have no place in the library. even the covers of some @caps should be removed for the good of the public. it's interesting how these things just slide by the library. i once saw a young by renting a @caps that had the words 'parental advisory' right on the cover! no one stopped him.     books are the same way. disturbing covers and titles are littered throughout the library. no one even cares to screen these books before they hit the shelves.     so, when do you think someone's going to do something about censorship in libraries? it is hard to say, but i strongly believe it's up to protesters like us to stop this. i hope you'll join me in this epic battle for censorship, to keep our youth safe
4 have you ever went to the library and while looking for a book you come across a book about slavery with strong language or teenage years which included alcohol, drugs, and sexual content?  in the library, you can find books for leisure, study, training, and books found offensive to a variety of people.  people from children whose parents would be appalled by what their kids are reading about to adults find books offensive.  although there is things in the library that are found offensive, i believe that books, movies, magazines, and music with offensive things in them should stay on the shelves because the internet is no different then the offensive things in a library, most people don't mind the vulgar and violence within the pages, and there are some fantastic books that some might find offensive.     people for centuries have been writing and coming up with songs, movies, and magazines.  what was accepted 'back then' is now considered inappropriate for viewers and readers.  there are many things in a library that, if not careful, could corrupt your children.  children reading about violence, drugs, and other no no's are what teaches them wrong.  parents and other people have been concerned about the censorship of libraries.  hard enough as it is, parenting doesn't need the help of books, movies, and music to influence the bad onto children.  children are the future and they need to be taught the right way.     an old librarian once told me that books need to be cherished throughout the years because they will eventually be replaced with technology and all the books, good or bad, will be gone.  it's hard to even imagine how technology is replacing various things in our lives and how it has changed from when it first started to be popular.  how does this pertain to offensive books?  like almost everything out there, the internet could be used for good, or for harm.  parents are concerned about their children reading books that are bad but let their child surf the internet which is hard telling how many inappropriate sites he/she might go to accidentally, or on purpose.  books, music, and other offensive stuff in libraries are minor compared to the internet.  protecting children from adult content filled libraries should be the least of a parents concerns.  even if they are concerned about the minds of their children when they go inside a library, they can filter what a child looks at and reads about.  the internet is the real bad guy if anything is going to be blamed for corruption of minds.     many people throughout the world have different tastes of what they like in a book.  a good plotline, good dialogue, interesting theme, drama, language, violence, drugs, alcohol, and sex are all ways people find reading books enjoyable.  their own opinion on what is interesting is what helps them decide on books to read.  reading books is a passion to some and enjoyable books is a must for them.  without offensive books, people would find reading boring, and wouldn't be as popular as it has been.  i don't know about you, but i enjoy books that aren't boring.  most offensive books are not boring and the action is what gets my attention and keeps me reading.     there are great books that for years people have enjoyed reading and continue to read today.  even thought they are offensive, they provide good details that are required for a good book.  tom @person and @person are famous for writing ghory, violent, grusome books that would be qualified as offensive to others.  you have the choice not to read them or to read them.  books that deal with slavery @month also be found offensive like the book @caps.  it does a supurb job at describing how things were during slave times.     books, music, magazines and music should not be removed from the book shelves because they are essensial to everyday people and reading. they are required by some to enjoy a good book.
3 in my personal opinon i think that those books that have things that you don't want to read or you think are offensive should stay. it's not like that person that is offended by it has to read it.            say you are in the library and you see a book that you think offends you. you think to your self that book should be removed from the library just because you think it is offensive, but you have to think in other peoples shoes.     just becaus you think a book is offensive doesn't mean that everyone else will think it is. that is why they have age groups and grade levels that are set up so a kid who likes picture books will not get stuck with a book that has curse words or other things that are meant for adults. same concept with movies, magazines, music, and etc.     take this for example. i was walking through the library when i saw a book called @caps the @organization, and i thought to myself that looks like a stupid book and i wouldn't want to read it. i think that they should throw this book away. now lets think does that sound fair. maybe that is some kids favorite book and when he comes in there the next day it is gone.      what about this, lets say you go in to look for your favorite book and you find out that someone found it offensive or someone just didn't like it as much as you did so they threw it away. doesn't seem to fair does it.     in conclusion that is what i think about removing books that are offensive or some people just don't like. i think they should leave it on there because we shouldn't remove it based on our personal opinon.
3 i think that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should not be removed from shelves if they are found offensive. people enjoy books with offensive language or content, people love to feel the engery or tone of the writer. i personal love offensive langauge if everything was censored it would feel like everything is dull and fake.     'your @caps****** cheating on me @caps****', @caps you feel the wow in body. now look if i censor it 'your cheating on me @person' it felt dull and if you got cheated on before you probably thought of ten different thing you would have said differently and uncensored. if your a parent who don't want their child reading or seeing this you should try to teach or keep your child away from this.     instead of removing why not just move them to an @num+ section of the library. the @num+ section will warn kids and parent what their getting into if their parent don't want them to be exposed to reality them then that means they should not be in that area.     libraries are usually divided into section but if not if you ask local libraries if they divide adult and children books into section of the libraries then they should tell you.
4 all materials in a library are for the public. this is why we have public libraries. children are most likely with an adult when they go to a library and are normaly looking for books or activities that they would enjoy at their age. if a costomer in a library finds a book or item that they find offensive then it most likely was not an accident. materials in libraries are for the public and should not be taken away just because a few find it offensive.     children are very suspicious in libraries because they know that adult material is also in the library. this is where an adult comes in and supervises the child. some parents don't mind that children see these images or read innapropriate information, but on the other hand some parents do. if someone comes across information that would be offensive they were most likely looking for it and are aware of where it is. everyone in a library has the right to take or read what they want. there is no sign outside the door that says only certain ages of people can visit certain areas of the store.      it is the parent or gardians decision to allow or not alow their child to visit the more innapropriate areas of the store. everyone has different rules and those rules are to be followed, but it is not the libraries job to keep track and watch those children to make sure they stay in their designated area.     there is a place for everything in a library and most of the locations are pretty obvious as to what kind of information is held there. for instance, more adult and innapropriate material is located in the back of the store. adult matter is held back there to make it more private and harder for little children to discover and to be alittle more private to people who are reading it. childrens' books and movies are usually loctaed in the front of the store so it draws their attention more. children @month never know what else is in the store if they dont go looking for it. children should be acompanied by an adult if the adult believes their child would wander off looking for innapropriate materal.     other material that could be offensive could not only be to children, it could be offensive to different races or cultures as well. also if a person finds that information, they were most likely looking for it. everything is labeled in a library and something doesn't just pop up out of nowhere if you where not looking for it.      overall material in a store is public and for anyone who comes into the store. children should be watched if they are suspicous and wander in the library. if someone does not want to find this informatin or think it would be offensive, then they should not go near the area which it is located
4 offensive materials @caps be anything but i'm talking about libraries and whats inside. books, music, movies, and magazines @caps be offensive to someone but not everyone. removing these materials from library shelves because a few people veiw them as offensive material is not a good idea because if they find it offensive then somewhere someone is enjoying it. not everyone will find a book, song, movie, or a magazine to be offensive and for that reason no books, cds, movies, or magazines should be withheld from the public in any library. my friends liked reading @person books but i did not like them, but i did not make them stop reading because of it, just like 'to @caps a @caps @caps,' @caps be offensive but if you find it offensive don't read it, plain and simple. there wil always be one person who doesn't want their kid to watch a certain movie, or read a @person book, but that is not a good reason to remove any materials from the libray shelves, let people read what they want to read, watch what they want, and listen to what they want, there is no good reason to remove a book form the libray shelves.     we all have a right to read, watch, and listen to anything we please. having somebody you have never seen get a book, movie, or a magazine removed from the library because they find it a little offensive, is like having someone kick you because you don't have a lot of money. many books from all over the world @caps be considered offensive to at least one person and that one maybe two people do not have any right to tell anyone what they can not read. censorship in libraries is a horrible idea because not everyone will read that book or listen to that cd. having a chance is all we need to read a book or listen to a song that might change our lives, for better or worse it should be our choice to read what we want.     any material @caps be considered 'offensive' but most of it is not offensive just what people don't want their kids to read. offensive or non-offensive materials can not be declared by a few people but by an entire country. what one man considers offensive another man considers to be life changing. anything can make someone change and in order to have that chance we should have the freedom to read what ever we would like. if you find a book offensive remeber this you had a chance to read it, now give that chance to someone else.
4 what @caps you do?     a very big battle for a lot of people is if libraries should allow offensive matterial to be on their shelves. some people don't care, but some people think it's a very big issue. for the people who care, their view on the issue is that the offensive matterial should be taken off of the library shelf. i personally believe that it should be ok for 'offensive' matterial to be on the shelves of the libraties across the @organization.     what is conciterd offensive? each and every person has their own view on what they think is offensive. an example is a young child @month think that the word 'stupid' is a curse word while some older people think that it is not a curse word. if we did take off all the offensive matterial from the libraries, there @caps be nothing left. you @month think that the @organization is a very good book, but if you talk to someone who believes the @organization is false, they @month think that by having the @organization of the shelf is offensive to their own beliefs. because so many people have a difforent view on what is offensive, no one @caps ever be able to actually have a non-offensive library. a group of people @caps not be able to agree on what is or what isn't offensive.      there are a lot of websites and organizations that say what they personally think is offensive and what is not. people can go to those websites and organizations to know what they personally should check out from the library. it should not be the libraries own job to say what you can and can not check out. each person is responsible for their own actions. if a person wants to check out a book or movie that some people think is offensive, so be it. it is a free world. some people @month not aprove of their choice, but again, they have the right to read that book or listen to that music.     in conclusion i state: no one should be able to say what you can and can not have on the shelves of the library. if someone personally thinks that a movie or book is offensive, then they should not watch that movie or read that book. really the question should not be, 'should we remove books, music, movies, magazines, etc. from the library that are offensive?', the question should be, 'should i be reading this book, watching this movie, or listening to this music?'. it is everyone's own choice to read a book or listen to a @location. we are not accountable for what other people do. it is not the libraries own resonsiblility to be a mother to all of it's cusomers. let the libraries be!
3 when you think of a book do you think happy kids books, or mysterious dark books? what if i was to say offensive books? most magazines, music, books, and movies you take off the shelf today are not so happy or mysterious that you @month think.      when i think of a movie i want to watch i think of something that im going to injoy; not something im going to shut off in the middle of it. what if you pick a movie that @month look good from the front cover and you read the back and it sounds good but when you get home to watch it with your little sister or brother its the exact opposite. do you turn it in? do you turn it off and waist your money not doing anything about it?     offensive books, movie, music, and magazines should be cleared from the store. if your not going to finish it, then why is it there? im not going to watch or read a book if its not going to make me feel good as a person or make myself feel good. if people can sit there and write it, act it or play it then we should be able to speak our oppinion on it if its good or not.      people have feelings, if there going be hurt by something we should enjoy then take them off the shelves. do something about it. we all should have the success for doing something for other people, and if not that then for ourselves.
3 certain books, magazines, music and movies should not be put on the shelves of a library. children can learn rude or nasty things that their parents might not find alright for their child. there are some things that can be offensive in a library like prejudice books or music. often music uses swearing language or states certain views on politics.     libraries need to take control of this issue the right way. getting rid of the material is not what should be done. libraries need to keep better watch over certain sections of the library. they could do this by not letting children leave their parents side. that way parents can know and control what their children are seeing.     then there is the issue of offending people. these problems could be resolved simply by putting up signs in different spots of the library. these sign could be in big bold letters stating 'certain things in this section can be offending', '@caps control needed past this point'. libraries should be more aware of how people feel about the way they are set up and presented to the public. libraries should put them selves in the publics shoes, to see how they would like it if some of these things were showed to their children. also, looking at things in a point of view of how some things could be offending, to fix the problems.     once when i was in a library i was offended by a book title that was against my religion. after seeing that i thought if their were a sign or something around to warn me i would not of had to see that. other things like this have occured in a library like one time my brother rented a movie my parents did not approve of. but with the way the libraries are set up and controled my brother was able to rent the movie and sneak it past my parents. other children like my brother could do the same things only worse like look at an inappropiate magazine or read certain books that parents would not approve.     these types of occurances need to stop before something really bad happens. libraries need to take control and show they know how to present things to the public in a proper manner. actions that are happening in todays libraries are not alright. putting up signs and requiring @caps control can reduce if not elliminate these unapproved occurances
4 what if some one found your favorite book offensive? inapporate materials do need to be kept from young minds of children.on the other hand, you can not sheild people from things they should know or already know. everyone has different things that they think are offensive, so one person might think a book is so bad it should be recalled from the shelves but an another person @month see no problem with it.     children need to be protected from materials that @month hurt them in some way. children do what they see and hear, so they are liable to try and cop harmful things they read . bad influences can be even magazines with famous celeberties being caught breaking the  law or doing bad things and young minds see that as 'cool' and @month try to follow tha example.     children and young people see and hear a lot worse things at home, television and even at school than in some books. children need to be protect but, you can't baby proof life. they willl be introduced to plenty of bad influnces in there life time but, it should be the parent's job to teach their kids to say no and stay away from bad things. kids can learn so much worse things from something at the library by just setting at home.     libraries are places for use public and the public covers a wide amount of different kinds of people and someone will always find something bothersome with somting or another. people have different views, believes and religions, and, books on these might be offensive to some but, the life style of another. like the  quote by katherine paterson, said if we take off the shelves every book or material that somone finds offensive there will be no books in the libraries at all.     yes, there are books that are not always very presentable to a certain group of people but, they should have a right to be read if their is someone who wants to read them. it is not the librarys job to be prejudice against certain books for because someone does't agree with it. books should be a wide varitey like the people who are reading them. also children are protect from books if they have learned morals that allow them to make mature choices
5 in todays world, children are exposed to a lot of inappropriate things than in recent times. they hear things from older siblings, see uncensored programs on television, hear words in music, and even learn things from books. an issue at hand is whether or not libraries should or should not dispose of inappropriate books, movies, music, and magazines. children can read whatever they like if their parents give permission, but in today's society some parents do not take the time to care, consumed in their work.     one way society can take care of this problem is setting age limits on books. there have been times when my mother will not allow me to read a book because it dealt with issues that i was not ready to learn about. although i am lucky that my mother cares about what i read, some parents are not. this is why an age limit would be helpful in keeping our youth modest. the librarians, or a national book association, could decide if the content of a book is appropriate for a certain age. this would take care of children reading about bawdy issues that they should not know about. also, @caps books should be more readily available. these types of books teach good morals and how to live a good and full life. in schools across the country, many @caps authors are not in the public school libraries. by putting these types of books into the libraries, students would be more aware of them and would most likely have an interest in them, learning from them.      another issue libraries have is music and movies. it is nice to be able to go to the library and check out a cd or even a movie. but, some of these have terrible language and scenes not appropriate for children. what can the general public do about this? well, demand that all music and videos with content not generalized for children be removed from the libraries. this would keep children from seeing and hearing actions they should not copy. there are ratings on movies for a reason, so why not use them. anything above @num should be a definent no in libraries. if the movie has content that any child under thirteen should not see, then the movie should be out.     magazines also offer a source of learning. some are very educational, and give the students ideas to go and come up with a new invention or a way to help others. but, some have content that are not suited for children. thus, like the books, the magazines should also have ratings. the magazine @caps, for example, has articles that are to bawdy for students to read. magazines like this should be put in an adult section where students cannot look at them. magazines also offer pictures that, in recent times, would have been illegal to put out. but, in today's standards, they are fine to put in magazines. these magazines should not even be allowed in the libraries across our nation.     america's standards on what is okay to read, look at, watch, and listen to have changed drastically. children are learning things they should not know about, until an older age, at a very young age. society need to put strict restrictions on what is right and what is not for children. i personally believe that there should be very strict restrictions on what children are allowed to watch, read, and listen to. my parents were very strict about this and, in the end, i feel this has benefitted my learning process. also, i feel the libraries should rid of books that, in olden times, would have been a shame to read. parents today are not as in sync with what their children do as they were in recent years. so, society needs to put a strict rule on what libraries carry and what they do not.
3 the author is writting about taking books off that the adult's don't want the book's the  end they won't have book's to. they take out the books that have bad words or pictures in them. well i don't really belive that they should take them out becuase they het intresting well some of them do. well i'm not a fan of reading i dont really like reading but i have to anyway and i dont think it should be taking out.          i don't really think it should be taken out for some reasons it's better to have them so kids can read and learn bout the pictures. some book's aren't that bad to kid's like to elementary kid's the only book's they like are the one's with picture's in them. the @caps school and middle school kid's like the chapter kind of book's and intresting book's. the parent's would like them to have educational book's that will help the kid's learn new word's and school related stuff.          the book's the adult's want are the kind that have meaning to like have alot of knowledge and school realated stuff. they want there kid's to learn about what they are reading. but yea i din't think they should take out the bbok's that they have they shoul'd just leave them for the kid's becuase there atleast are educational to them. so the adult's would have more educational student's to relly on
1 there were many features of the setting that affected the cyclist. for instance, it was extremely hot and dry. also it  was nearly deserted, almost all of the places he crossed were deserted .a  lost her features of the setting were a ram shackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that caldnt hald in the lamest move.an is the feature give you an idea if haw the cyclist feels.  
1 well i would put it like this is that the weather had everything to do with it because the not weather make you tired and upset and easy to angre so now it make you upset and and then stress.
1 the setting in the story changes many times. it starts in an area with rivers and pine trees. then the cyclist arrives ant a town. after that he is pounded by the hot sun and along hilly road. with not much water left the cyclist uses all the energy he had to get to a town where he could get something to drink. the setting was what made the cyclists journey a hard one.
2 the setting in the story discouraged the biker very much. as he follows the advice of the elderly men and starts off his journey he notices that there is,  no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.  he uses tone words to describe how had things are when he says,  the water bottle contained only a few tantalizing sips.  he describes in exhaust how hard his journey is getting. he describes the intense heat inthe desert of california, pedaling up,   one long, crippling hill.  the terrain did not make his rideeasy at all. the factor of weather, rolling hills, and the shortage of water take a tall on him. if he were on flat terrain on a cool day then he would have been first fine.
1 some of the features of the setting affect the cyclist like the road was bad it had bumps all over that made it much harder and it also took up a lot of strength. also the neighborhood of two hundre degrees after that become to a road with arore bunch of hills
1 the features of the selling effect the cyclist a lot. one factor that would effect the cyclist would be the heat. also, because of this factor, he s pobably suffering from lack of water. he s probably really hot seeing he s the only one cut in the middle of nowhere for what looks like miles. another feature of the setting that would probably effect the cyclist is the thought of there @month be a car around this next turn. if he can t see around the next turn he doesn t know is coming. the cyclist could also be thinking about when the next town will show up.
3 the features of the setting in  do not exceed posted speed limit  affect the main character the cyclist. the cyclist is biking  through the high desert of california in june.  so naturally it can be infereal that it is not and dry, making water a delicacy. as the cyclist is passing through a ghost town and a pump that releases  a tarlike substance followed by brackish water  he is runningout of his precious water. the surrounding landscape of lonely hills tumbleweeds and snakes does not inspire confidence. in fact, the cyclist feels that  l cald drop from heat stroke on a gorgeous day in june.  he finds an old grape juice factory no longer in service causing more anxiousness and dispare l have had an experience similar to this where l wat out walking in a state park in the @date. i was freezing, and a desolate landscape of snow covered trees made me feel at if i d never be warm again similar to he cyclist who s environment made him feel hes wald die of dehydration. so, as can be seen. he setting of this short story affects the cyclist.   
1 the features in the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. when the cyclist was going through the desert, it had be dry old, dirty   . i came to a fork of sorts, one ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn t hold in the largest mule greeted me. this side was troubling.  when she wanted to us the rusty water pump farlike substance oozed out and the water seem like to be @num degrees.  not two miles into this next section of ride, i notice the terrain changing. flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.  this made it more difficult for the cyclist to ride the bike. this would make the cyclist more tired. as the cyclist moved on it was getting more tire and his water supply was going down. it was try me to keep his balance while he kept riding
2 in the short story the cyclist was affected by the setting in many ways. the author was running out of water throughout the whole story.  the water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.  there was a limited amount of water in the bottles. he had to travel a long distance.  not two miles into the next section.  he was getting tired quick. also the terrain was not good.  i noticed the terrain changing, flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.  it get harder and harder to continue his ride.
1 the settings affect the cyclists for many reasons. one, if the setting is nice, the rider can concentrate on the scenery not on only pain they are having. also, if the setting isn t very nice, the rider would probably concentrate more on the pain than they would the scenery. another thing is if the setting is very hilly & the rider has to drive over it, it @month not feel the greatest. the cyclist would get even more pain than before plus the cyclist could could get dehydrated faster, the setting really does affect the cyclist.
1 there are many ways that the setting affected the cyclist. one way is in the story when it says that it was very hot, he could become dehydrated and could possibly have a heat stroke, also the rodes were windy. this could be a problem because hes tired so he might not be able to go around the turns, he might just keep going straight and then get lost even more. that is all about how the features of the setting affect the cyclist in the story.
3 the features of the setting in the essay,  rough road ahead: do not exceed posted speed limit,  greatly affected the cyclist. in the beginning of this man s journey he was confident in his abilities.  i rode in the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face.   the cyclist was prepared for an exciting day and the setting supported this feeling.  the cool pines and rushing rivers of yosemite had my name written all over them.  @caps, as the setting began to change and his water ran out, the cyclist's attitude changed. he was  traveling through the high deserts of california in june  without much water and begun to feel desperate. as more and more abandoned buildings and deserted towns appeared he went into despair.  at some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously larg snake - it really did look like a diamondback-blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me.  he was in the middle of nowhere with no one around and because of this setting he lost hope of surviving. he thought he was going to die of heat stroke, not having any water left, on these short rolling hills and under the extremelyly hot sun. the cyclist was affected by the features of the setting, going from confidence, to desperation and despair, and then to relief, the changes in setting caused his change in attitude throughout this journey. 
3 in the stories, don t exceed posted speed limit, there are some very descriptive settings. in the stories these settings have a great effect on the cyclist. through these our settings the effects change. some good effects some harsh effects. the first setting that is described do you is,  the cool pines and rushing rivers of yosemite had my name written all over them.  this setting gives you a vivid picture of were the cyclist is heading. this setting also establishes a happy sort of mood. let the pretty picture is about to change. not so much further in to the cyclist ride he noticed a change of terrain,  flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.  @caps the cyclist is short on water, and is becoming very tyered. seeing this just crushes his spirit. @caps riding hills hard, but ridding hills with our knowing of something good waiting for you on the other side of the hills. both of these, very different settings gives off very different feeling. the first one makes you think he is going to have as easy enjoy able bike ride. but this all changes when he hit those horrible hills. just the thought of having so ride over miles of hills, makes your legs hurt. over all the features of the setting saposed an intense bike ride for the cyclist, followed by a reward by beautiful place.      
2 the features of the setting affects the cycles such that it was affecting his altermmation to continue. for example, after @num miles he looked upon the  ramshackeled sched, several rusty bumps and the corral  this sight troubled me. in the desert his water tasted like the flavor of  battery acid.  it also goes on to say that it was a  test for my inner spirit.  it also states that he went along with a few drops of water through the tumbleweeds. this passage shows obstacles he had to go through in which he did and made it with a little confidence. although his situation was somewhat unbearable he still kept striving on.
2 how the features of the setting affect the cyclist by taking and not had the right setting. the features are just not right and and they could be changed around a little bit and still have about the same meaning of the essay. so i think they should change it around.
1 the features of the setting affected the cyclist mainly because he was in a desert. there were no stores, no rivers or lakes, it was very hot, the roads were long and there were even snakes on the road. it made it harder for him because he didn t have much water to drink.
3 the features of the setting affect the cyclist with his train of thought. on page @num it says,  i had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and i was traveling through the high deserts of california in june.  this gives a sence of heat and foreshadows maybe the lack of water he ll have later on. as he passes a snake,  trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.  so the cyclist is most likely begin to feel dizzy and begins to loose hope. on page @num he says,   i could drop from heatstroke   meaning he s starting to think of the worse possible things that could happen. which effects him because he s beginning to loose hope and  thinks he s not going to make it. on page @num, he says,  i was going to die and the birds would pick me clean   by this point the conditions he was having were rough and making him worry. this is how the features of the setting affected the cyclist throughout the story.
2 the setting in the story affected the cyclist. the setting takes place in june. it is very hot and the cyclist is getting very dehydrated. you can imagine how hot it got when it said,  wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn t a mirage.  it also sounded in the story that it felt like two hundred degrees when the sun was beating down
2 the features of the setting affect the cyclist because the climate could be hot, the road could be bumpy, and the town could be deserted. for example,  rough road ahead. do not exceed posted speed limit.  this would be hard for a cyclist who is thirsty. and if he is not and with no water he probably could  barely make it up the hills. and with no town for water he would be thirsty. first  town  this place might have been a thriving little spot at one point but anthor warning it fit the outsides of ghost town  no waters
3 the terrain in  do not exeed posted speed limit  by joe kurmaskie the cyclist had to cope with many difficulties. he was already lacking water from the anduous journey and then the enviroment turned against him. the narration states,  i noticed the terrain changing flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills. (kurmaskie @num). this means the cyclist is going to put forth more energy to make it up these hills. energy he barely has. this  will drain almost all the energy the cyclist has. another example is,  at some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path (kurmaskie @num). this means that the cyclist is in the middle of nowhere with barely any water and energy, causing even more problems. in conclusion, the setting in,  do not exceed posted speed limit  by joe kurmaskie caused many problems for the cyclist.  
2 the features of the setting effected the cyclist very much. for example, the sun was beginning to beat down. another example, i was hitting my water bottles pretty regularly. the setting were hot and dry. it effected the cyclist very much. it was to the point of dying.
1 the setting affect the cyclist features because if the cyclist was riding in @location around june the affect @month not had been that harsh. but overall the setting out begin in a hot place with limited water was not a good thing. that s how the cyclist is affected by the setting.
2 the features of the setting affect cyclist in many was it was like a crazy maze, the road he was own, and him not really knowing were he was going didn t help him, or not having enough water. this is how the features of the setting affect the cyclist.
2 the cyclist on her trips sees a lot of features that would discourage her. she is riding in high desserts of california in june  (kurmaskie). we all know desserts are steaming hot and dry especially in june. she also encounters hills (kurmaskie) to make matters wose she was travelling on hills in the extreme heat.though the cyclist goes through many perilous obstacles she makes it to a camp a lives i could seethe horizon, telling myself that i could make it that par, i'd be fine. (kurmaskie) this shows the author's dedication and that if you don tgive up you will be fine.
1 the feature of setting affect the cyclists because if you are a guy and you ride a bike then you might have to where about falling of your bike, or out of water. i you keep at a fast past and don t have any water then you can get dehydrated. in the essay it tells how he had ran out of water and he thout he was going to die he had gotten dehydrated but lukly he had find some were to get something to drink
1 the features of the setting affects the cyclist in many ways. one way it affects the cyclist is because of the weather condition. being that it is very hot outside the cyclist does not have enough water. another way it affects the cyclist is because of the condition alongside the road. for example the tumbleweeds and the snakes. being that its not out most likely the desert is in process of a drought and he gets very dehydrated. i believe these are the reasons because it all makes a lot of sense and affects the cyclist.
3 the features of the settings affect the cyclist in many ways when he starts of, he is bright and happy just as the slenecy is nice and calming. there is a pace that makes him feel like nothing wrong.  i rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face.  after about @num miles on the cold, his life was getting low, and he came to his second abundant place. he then felt a little disturbed and worried. he needed to find a place with water.  this site was trebling.   there he fins water plant not his hopes rise a bit, until he finds the water isn t good.  a tarlike substance oozed out, followed by brickish water feeling some which is in the neighborhood of two hundred trees . so he moves on and finally he re aches life! he is so relieved he can t believe his luck.  then as easily as rounding a body my troubles, thirst and fear were all behind me  the setting affects the mood in a very big way, the cyclist feels as the setting looks.
3 as the cyclist begins his journey, he is confident & exited to have been offered new directions from some  old wise men  which promise a shortcut. this water supply is mediocre & attitude willed against the flat and hilly terrain, untill he realizes the directions are way off  target. the cyclist was making his way to yosemite when he came to the first  town  but it wasn't a town but more of a ghost dwelling. as he continued hoping the shortcut offered by the old  codgens  would actually materialize, he realized he was utterly alone in the hot desert wt a depleting water supply & dwindling spirit. he was disturbed that he had chosen to follow the advice from the older men and through his his pain & dispair, encouraged himself by deciding he would never listen to their type again. the cyclist felt skrewed over, yet through his will & determination, by rationing water & mentally choosing to cycle for each hill one at a time, he endured his physicall, emotional & mental trials and lived to learn the valuable lesson of never consulting old   codgers  on mapping issues, because their information would most likely be out datted.
2 the features of the setting effected the cyclist in many ways. one way was because of the @caps @caps. with the cyclist having limited amount of water effected him to. the cyclist listened to the old men so therefour he traveled a good distance. so that made matters bad. with having lack of water with such distance to go the cyclist stuck pebbles in his mouth hoping to forget about his thirst. the cyclist thought of him dying and the birds picking him clean, because he thought he would die because dehydration. the conditions of the road made it harder, first he started with nothing but straight roads then ended up going up and down hill. in conclusion, the cyclist hit many obstacles that made his trip harder then what he thought.
3 the features surrounding the cyclist effect him greatly. all he has around him are hills, rough terraine, sand + tumble weeds. these features leave him thinking he will die because there is no life around him. everything is dry + vivid + thats how it makes him feel. the old, rusty water pump shows that it hasn t been used in ages + the black tar pumped out is no help to his negative thought of life.
3 the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. the cyclist persevered through the rough terrain which caused him to become weak. for example, the author states  looked the majority of the pavement in front of me and ceased past tilling to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.  this shows the author is dehydrated because it is so hot and he kept going even with a physical obstacle. another thing that affected the author was that he felt like giving up because the terrain was too harsh. for instance in the text,  it didn t really matter i was going to die and the birds will pick me cleary waveng only some experience outdoor gears.  this shows that the author still had to go even when time get tough. the text shows how exhausted he is by the winds eating at him when he dies. he would dehydrate to the humidity of the desert and heat. in other words, the features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways.
1 the features of the setting affect cyclist because if you are going down hil and then hit a rough road you not going to do so good. like for example he had been going on flat land then it changed to hills lastly into rough road. these conditions could seriously hurt someone.
2 the features of the setting affect the cyclist in a couple different ways. when the cyclist found the gohst town since no one was there he could not ask someone for better directions or get some food or water. the short rolling hills make it harder to pedal because it is hard to pedal uphill. at the end of the story he found a bait shop where he got water and better direction's.
1 the features in the setting effects the cyclist because there it different kinds of hills. he has watch out for rocks in the middle of the road. he has to make sure he has a lot of water because it looks like he is in the desert. there is no cars around but he still has to look for any cars in case they came out of nowhere. there is a lot of turns. it is very hot so he has to make sure he does not have a neat scaoke. there is no places where he can stop because there is no shade. there is no stores where he can stop & get water and food at either. that is the setting of the cyclist.
2 in the story, the cyclist starts out with a lot of confidence that he can complete the whole ride. but after he left first town he had been riding and needed water, so he stoped at a fork in the road he had just to;to get water from a pump which tastes like battery acid. then as he progressed further in his trip he came to a sign that said  rough road ahead: do not exceed speed limit (joe kurmaskie pg @num) this part of his trip made it very challenging by making him face rough roads and mountains that he had to cross which sucked the water out of him. then as  he came over the last mountain, he saw a sign for a gart store. so when he arrived he got some water and got directions for a man who had the best map. so you can see that going over an the mountains, sucks all the water out of the cyclist, so he was so relieved when he got the water at the end.
2 the features of the setting affects the cyclist by letting the author have hope . when he came across a sign which read  rough road ahead: do not exceed posted speed limit, his hope was faint because he was doing a water-depleting @num per hour. because of the rate of the water, he felt life was cruel sometimes and he thought that he was at the point of losing water. also when he came across the tumbleweeds and the large snake he tried to avoid them. if he would have been bitten he would have died. finally because of the heat he might have also did from the heatsroke  wide signs  of   dried        
2 the setting really takes determination away from the cyclist. the were hills that made his ride difficult. it says,  over one long cripping hill, a bulding came into view.  this shows the hills were hard on him because he says they were long and crippling. another thing in the setting was the building. he was extremely thirsty and becomes he to an abandoned grape juice factory it said, ''by the looks of a had beth a @caps grape juice factory and bottling plant.  these were two of several examples of the setting affecting the cyclist.
3 in the article  do not exceed the posted speed limit,  the features of the setting took toll on the cyclist in many ways. first off the whole setting was a dry, dusty not desert that would chair anybody.  the sun was beginning to beat down, but i borely noticed it.  the own affected the cyclist by dehydrating him so much, which bring me to the next point.  i had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly and i was traveling through the high deserts of california in june. this caused him to become even more dehydrated, resulting in him thinking he was going to die. along the way he found an old abandoned juice factory. this affected him by filling him with despair and hopelessness, causing him to push more and more to reach water. in the end the feature of the setting only made him more determined to reach water.
2 the features of the setting affect the cyclist by their were rolling hills that went up and down and it to alot of streanth and also he barely had water because, it was so hot he kept drinking and ran out of water early. in the story it say when he was riding that   he barely noticed that the sun was starting to beat down.  this quote shows it was starting to get hot. also, in the story he says   i checked my water supply.  @caps means he s starting to realize his waters running short. so in all the setting is hot abandoned and theirs no water source, so  the cyclist is being affected by all of this
1 i think that the features of the setting really do affect the way someone rides a bike because certain places have certain terrain. some types are not always good for a bike rider because if it s bumpy then someone could fall off the bike. also, if it is dark you @month not even be able to see where you are going then you could hurt your-self very seriously. that s why riding a bike is dangerous. also, if your in the type of enviroment where every thing is smooth then you @month be able to have a nice bike ride.  
1 a cyclist is a bike rider. they can be in groups of diffrent people or they can be a solo cyclist. some cyclist go for a few miles riding there bikes some can go for more like @num miles, some go over hills, go trow water they do alot with what they do. they have alot of time on there hards to ride a bike that far.
2 the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many way. having desert rahas makes you want to just lay their and not try to go any further, because you don t know where and end will be. as for grassy, flowery land its more of a sense rout, and makes you want to keep going and see many things. hills and terrain make it harder to keep going but more of a chalange, and a good workout at the same time, the setting does affect the cyclist.
3 the features affect the cyclist in a big way. for one the  heat beating down on him made him sweaty, hot and tired. the heat had also made him thirst which led him to drink a lot of water in a little amount of time so he ran out of water before the next town. also the fact he was in the desert there were no trees to give time off shade that he could rest in. there were also no people around to help him or give him water. so in the ride he struggled more than he thought he could.
2 the dusty, dry setting has a serious effect on the cycling author. it got so long and hot that,   @caps blues tune  summer time  rattled around in my deteriorating brain.  the author has spent so long cycling through heat, his brains starting to shut down. it s also because there is very little water left for him. another problem is that every building/town except the last building is deserted. so without any chance of being refueled and restocked, it s the author v.s nature. plus, as the author states, the directions came from old people who,   haven t left their porches since carter was in office.  the word has greatly changed. towns have become deserted, buildings rundown but the roads are kept in shape. the towns the old people mentions are now ghost towns, and are no help to the author. 
1 the features of the setting affect the cyclist because it just looks like he is on the highway as in the desert riding his motorcycle or bike and it does look like hes coming or going on a vacation and because of the way hes riding it it seems hes going real fast as about to fall.
2 the setting affected the cyclist greatly. he had no water and he was  traveling through the high deserts of california in june.  the deserts and no water could have been life-or-death to him, making him stressed and thirsty. couple that with him biking, and you have yourself a dehydrated man in the desert! when he was between the  ghost town  and bait shop he says,  there was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind, this would make the cyclist think that there is no hope for his survival if he passed out. the deserts of california affects any cyclist greatly especially one without water like the cyclist in the story. 
1 the features of the setting affect the cyclist because in paragraph @num it say that the temperture was was getting high and that when he drank the water that it test like battery acid. this would affect him because it it was so hot and the water was starting to get hot how would he be able to get through the day with out pasing out also in paragraph @num it say the roads changed to hill when you ride up and down the hills you become tired from pumping you legs then you would feel hot and tiredd and would not want to ride the bike. that how the features of the setting affect the cyclist.
1 the setting affect the cyclist in alot of ways one way is that if you dont know where your going you could get hurt. also is if the road condition are very bad. that is how the setting affected the cyclist.
3 in the selection  do not exceed posted speed limit  there are a lot of great details of the area around the cyclist. in the text, it makes it clear that the route the cyclist is traveling is very deserted when the drinking water was explained as oozing out and tasting like battery acid, you can tell that people hadn t been there in awhile. also, being informed that he was traveling through a desert, in june. i am able to understand how thirsty he is. also, he is traveling for miles over a rough terrain and  crippling hills,  according to the text, so he has to be ovely exhausted. i could understand why he was so upset with getting wrong directions based on the troubles he encounters when he finally reaches the camp and drinks water, you too are glad he has reached somewhere that wasn t empty and deserted.
1 the features that effect the cyclist are that he is riding his bike in the desert and doesnt have any water. that effects his journey because he is dehydrated so he needs to find water fast so it is making him get to yosemite slower because he needs to find water. that is a feature that affects the cyclist
2 the features of the setting affect the cyclist because they are extreme and do not change. the cyclist was riding on a small road in the desert. in the desert it was very hot and because of this the cyclist was sweating a lot and getting dehydrated. also because he was in the desert he had no sense of direction. also the towns are all run down with nothing in them, so the cyclist couldn t get any water to drink to rehydrate himself. only when he comes to a small bait shop close he finally get water.
2 the setting was calm and peaceful as he started out riding his bike. he was smiling and his legs were strong. as he hit the @num town and saw a ramshackled shed, rusty pumps, and a corral, he begun to be troubled b/c he was running out of water. as the flat rodes were replaced wi short, rolling hills he became even more troubled.  when he saw a building he became happy but when he found out it was run down he was sad, thirsty, and tired. when he finally saw an old man and told him he had a map he became a little happier b/c he was going to get to yosemite. as the setting became worse his mood became worse b/c he had less and less water and felt very hopeless. but when he saw the man he became happy b/c the map was going to help him.
1 i read  do not exceed posted speed limit  written by joe kurmaskie in the story the features of the setting affect the cyclist by accepting advice from  old timers who haven t left the confines of their porches @caps was in office 
2 the feature of the cyclist and the settings arn t that good. there re insidents that are a problem. one is the bad weather. there is a tempature that makes it feels pretty close to @num degrees. he stops at a water pump, water comes out but it is really not cool. he takes two little sips and its like battarey acid. if he would to drink alot of that water it would probably kill him or make him very ill. he needs something because there was another town @num miles down the road so he has to find something to keep him going. as he is going down the road he sees a sign: rough road ahead: even though he is going @number mph he could still hit a hole and go flying over his handle bars. if he does go over his handle bars he could run into the snake he saw then get eaten by the birds because he wouldn t have any energic to get up. there re some interesting sence in the story.
1 the features of the setting will affect the cyclist because the roads are hilly and he is old so it will be hard for him to ride up them. it was very hot and he had a scares supply of water. he was seeing things that wasn t there. when he did try to get some water, the weather was so hot that the water from the pump came out hot.
1 the features of the setting affect the cyclist by never accept travel advice from colletion of old timer who haven t left there porches since carter was in office. after that because you don t know if they are real collection or what. after because some people have not left there porches since carter was in office. i don t know why people have not left there porches since carter was in office.
1 in  do not exceed posted speed limit  by joe kurmaskie: c, i think that e the setting affected the cyclist because he was thirsty and he thought he was going to die in this case he had no water left and he was in the desert. he was regreating not taking the advice of the stranger and was dieing of thirst. also he dident have the mind set that he wanted to live. thats how i think the setting affectd him.    
1 the desert like land affected the cyclist by making him tired and loss of body water, then that therefor making him need water to go on. i think the thought of being so thirsty made him become more weak. if he wasn t thinking about it the ride wouldnt have bin so ruff
2 some features of the setting affected the cyclist. the rolling hills, poisonous snake, and the conditions of the road worried her. for example, @caps said,  i was going to die and the birds would pick me clean, leaving only some expensive outdoor gear and the diary.  @caps had high doubt when saying that quote. @caps didn't think @caps would ever make it. finally, @caps reached another destination and again finding herself asking another older man for directions!
2 the features of the setting in rough road ahead: do not exceed posted speed limit.  affect the cyclist in many ways. first in the essay when the @caps says he is in the deserts of california, that can affect because it gives them an idea of how hot it most likely was out there and how lack of water can really harm someone. also when the @caps describes the water pumps and what comes out o them, it can give the cyclist a feeling of disgust and remind them to always keep a good water supply.
3 in this story, the cyclist was trying to make it to yosemite, california. in the begining, the cyclist was sure of himself he decided to ask some old men that looked like they haven't been off their porch since carter was in office for directions. the old men ended up leading him into the middle of the desert. in the desert, the sun was beating down on him and he had a limited supply of water. there was no sign of civilization what so ever. these hot conditions made the cyclist very hot, tired, and very thirsty. but that didn't stop him, he kept going and eventually he came apon a little town where he could drink cool water and take a well needed rest.

3 the features affect the cyclist.the setting affects the cyclist because it s real hot. so he takes a couple tips on some short cuts by some old men. then come to find out these tips weren t really short cuts. so now he s riding and angry that he took their tips. also he s running out of water and becoming dehydrated. he sees an abonded place with water, but in order to get it you need to pump it. so he starts pumping and sees black gunk. he pumps for about @num to cool the water, but it doesn t cool off. come to find out the water tastes like battery acid. so he starts riding again. but encounters a snake. luckily he gets away, but he feels that he s about to die and regrets listening to men who haven t got off their porch since @person was president. what makes him more angry is that they seemed so sure. as as he's riding he sees a juice factory and goes there. now it s a fishing store and drinks lots and lots of water. he also says he s never listening to old men and he ll always use the map.
1 i think features affect the cyclist because when you write a bycles you need to con
2 the setting of the story affects the cyclist in a negative way. he intrusted that these men he had asked directions from knew what they were talking about. with the directions in mind he traveled on his way to his destination. only to find deserted towns, disowned factorys, and hills. with all this being the  high deserts of california in june.  with all these aspects the cycalrst was worn out and dehydrated saying  i d read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst  shaving his deep name of thirst. after finding a place to get a drink he stated  i had an overwhelming and buy some bait  showing his deep gratitude and relief of finding water.
2 there is many things that could have made his bycicle ride much more enjoyable, one thing is if he wasn t in the middle of no where and if he actually knew where he was. for example,  there was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.  there, he had almost no water to get him through the day. for instance,  the water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.  @caps, he did not know where he was going so it was harder for him. in conclusion these are some things that made his trip hard.
1 throughout the riders long journey the setting greatly affected him. for example, the hot weather caused him to drink the majority of water suply making him dehydrated and tired. if the weather was cool he would have lasted much longer.
2 the environment around people in certain situations can affect them in many ways. for instance if  you are hot, tree could be shade, or thirsty, a river neer by could help your thirst. if you were hungry and hot, but nothing was near you this could make you hot. in this cyclist case the environment affected him in many ways, from bumpy roads,  ghost towns, and trees. for example he said,  the sun was beginning to beat down, but i barley noticed,  this is because of the  cool pines  around him as he explains in the next paragraph. it also says in the text that the terrain changed and he even came upon a snake, which added to his thirst. so then making it harder for him to go one. from reading the the text on can see how features can have effects on a person.
3 the cyclist in the essay rough road ahead: do not exceed posted speed limit feels discouraged and dehydration because of the setting. near the beginning, after viewing the first stop which consisted of a few broke buildings and some rusted pumps he states  this sight was troubleing,  he also feels dehydration when he reaches the pumps and finds the produce  a tar like substance oozed out, followed by blackish water . also as he is pedaling he sees a sign that says do not exceed @number miles per hour. he
2 in this quick passage by joe kurmaskie, the many conditions  of the road and the area around it determine how he acts and what he feels,   the  sun was beginning to beat down ,   (kurmaskie) .he is starting to get tired  because   it is becoming hot and sunny, so he is feeling less confident. he was traveling through the high deserts of california in june  . (kurmaskie).not only is he very tired and hot not where he is riding is barron and open and there is no one around him to give him help or to find water. through the passage you can tell that the temperature and weather around the cycler can change how and why how he does. 
3 the features of the setting greatly affect this cyclist. at first he is fine riding along the old-timers  shortcut  as he states that  things began well enough. i rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face.  but what he didn t know was this was the beginning of a very rough day. he arrived at the first  town  which was a ghost town. he wasn t overly worried yet but at about sixty miles in on his journey he came to a ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a broken down corral. the cyclist explains how he had drank a lot of his water and was in need of some. he tried the pumps but he explains how  a far like substance oozed out, followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.  a couple miles later he came to a highway sign that read rough road ahead: do not exceed posted speed limit. the cyclist continued on desperate for water. he even came across a snake. he was now fearing a heat stroke. he came to an abandoned grape juice factory and hung his head. the cyclist then was almost completely dehydrated from the long, tiring bike rid. the cyclist was sure he was going to die from dehydration or a heatstroke that this terrible ride had caused. he finally came to a shop a drank from the sink. so this ride was torturous due to the setting.
3 the features of the setting affect the cyclist by making him dehydrated, troubled, and relieved. the cyclist is dehydrated because of the horrible heat. he says  the growing realie at von that l would drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in june.  this means that the heat is a treat to him and would cause him to become dehydrated and have heatstroke. the cyclist is troubled by the scarce sourroundings.  a corral that couldn t hold the lamest mule.  he is getting worried because there is no one around and his directions are starting to sound wrong. the cyclist is relieved by the water from the sink. he had the  overwhelming urge to seek out gary and wilber, kiss them.  this means that that he is so relieved that he has finally found water and he wants to thanks the owners of the bait shop for providing it.
3 in ''do not exceed speed limit,'' by joe kurmaskie, the author depicts the vivid details of the setting and how they contribute to the cyclist s condition. for example, the author wrote  over one long, crippling hill, a building come into view. i wiped the sweat from my eye  the way the author described the hill as  crippling  should how much energy it was taking away from the cyclist. another quote that contributed to the cyclist s journey was,  that smoky blues tune ''summer time  rattled around in the dry honeycombs of my deteriorating brain.  this expressed how dehydrated the summer heat way making him. i believe the author used modifying details to support the description of the cyclist s condition. i think the description of the setting enhanced the reader s perception of the cyclist s journey.   
2 the setting in this story is very hard for the cyclist. his main problem is the lack of water. if you deprive the body of water all of your major organs will bake in the hot sun. another problem was the condition of the terrain. it is very hard to cycle on bumpy dry land. these are any a few problems the cyclist encountered.
1 the setting is a desert in california in june, this affects the cyclist because it is very hot and he only has a couple drinks of water. there is no place for the cyclist stop and get more water. he says,  there is no one in sight, not a building,car, or structure of any kind.  as you can see that kind of setting would definetly affect the cyclist.
1 some feature on the setting that @month have affected the cyclist was the fact that he was running out of water and when he pumped water he said he pumped with all his strenght at first a tar like substance oozed out follwed by brackish water he said the water tasted of battery acid. also in this setting the cyclist notices a terrain change flat road then turned short hills , follwed by a snake that looked od a diamond back.
3 the features of the setting affect the cyclist s attitude towards the old men. since the cyclist listened to the old mens directions he was furious with himself. seeing that the last attempt of direction had caused the cyclist to become nearly delicious, the setting had added severly to the problem. the beating sun and high desserts in california in the middle of june made the cyclist dehydrated and tired. when he come to a rusted water pump  black tar oozed out, you can picture the cyclist as furious and anxious and of course thirsty. the rough terrain and tumble weeds had caused the cyclist to feel skeptical of his decision to follow the old mens-directions.
0 i think that if we where to inforce the punishments on those who speed that there wuold be less car crashes really those that have bad road rage shuold be in anger management
2 there were many features that affected the cyclist. one feature included the first ghost town that he come by.  but on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town.  this had to affect him a little because he knows now that the people who told him the shortcut haven t peen out for awhile. another feature that affected the cyclist was the lack of water in a  desert in california in june.  the cyclist now knows that it might be awhile before he gets any more water. the hills also had an affect on the cyclist because he knew now he was going to have to work really hard to get into the next town, without drinking much water. the welch s building also had an affect on him since it was abandoned and no drinks were left. in conclusion, the cyclist had to battle many features on his way to the national park.
1 in the story, the man has a very hard time trying to get to some water. he faces many obsticales in the story. for example, he has gone about @num miles without water. also, their are a lot of hills and turns withen the story which slow him down he is having a hard time getting to water because of many obsticals
1 in the essay the features of the setting affected the cyclist. the cyclist used words to discribe the setting like  flat road  and  short, rolling hills , there were also more example. the way the cyclist discribed the setting gave the reader a visual picture. i think the cyclist was affected by the setting.
2 the conditions in the california desert were horrible for a cyclist. the temperature was extremely high and the humidity was very dry. the roads also had a lot of hills and when a cyclist has to use his energy in the heat to go up and down hill after hill, it can be very hard. there were also no stops to refill his water a long the way,which is bad because the neat,lack of water,and all of his energy extension leads to major dehydration.the conditions along this trip are not good for a cyclist and can be very dangerous.
1 the features of the setting affect the cyclist was like saying you are old and that you know nothing at all. but it is not true. it means you are older and that your information @month not be correct for example in the essay when he was on his way to the town he learned to use his map instead of a guys opinion because the guy was wrong.
2 the cyclist listen to the geogers. after a while he starts to get tired. after the seenery desert change he starts to get mad. he criticizes himself for accepting advice from  old-timers who haven t left the
1 in the story the cyclist explains how the road goes from good to bad: an example,  rough road ahead: do not exceed posted speed limit. also the dry.
2 in the  rough road ahead: do not exceed posted speed limit  by joe kurmaskie, the features of the setting affect the main characters, the cyclist. after he first journied from the house where he met the old men, he rode over much flat desert terrain, where the sun beat down and dehydrated him. soon, though the terrain changed.  flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.  this tests his endurance even more as he has to maneuver down the hills while dehydrated and ready to collapse from exhaustion.
0 the story that i am doing the most was going to talk about what happen in the story i was not shore but the name of the story sound prety good if i was in the story i not be good becaus the story is really crazy i would be realy good two start and right
1 i work better when i can feel the  environment.  i think  the some goes  for  cycling  in  the  mountain , fresh air and no worries  on  you  mind them  cycling can become fun like the climates into the easy he even the fresh air,  the fine trees and the environment  makes him feel  better  so for cyclist environment plays a vital role.
3 the features of the setting had a big impact on the cyclist. when he started that ride, he was confident that the  old timers  were right about which directions and roads he had to take to get to yosemite national park. though the sun was bearing down, he refused to give up, just as he says  the sun was beginning to beat down, but i hardy noticed.  he came up to places that were worn down and deserted, so he knew he was alone if anything happened. the desert heat had made him down his water pretty regularly, so he tried to get more, as in,  i got on my hands and knees when l tried a drop or two, it has the flavor of battery acid  paragraph @num. he was so thirsty that he would drink hot water. then he thought he has only @num miles to go, so he kept going. he weakening as he pedaled along the changing terrain as he was  trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.  with what little energy he had last, he had passed an abandoned well be grape juice factory, which probably tested his patience and sanity. he had resorted to,  gathered up a few pebbles and stuck them in my mouth  just to keep his mind his thirst. he was losing hope when he came upon   gary and wilber s fish camp best bet  then he felt relieved after he was able to get cool water. by then he's learned his lesson, to stick to his map.
1 the features in the setting affecting the cyclist because of the heat and the terrain. i say this because in the story it describes all the hills that he has to go up and down with the herendous heat beating down on him. the heat also makes it hard because it makes you drink more and throughout the story he was trying to find some water, and the water he did find was about  two hundred degrees and tasted like a battery acid.  if you have no water that makes it very hard to bicycle that far of a distance in that much heat.
1 there were many features of the setting that affeced the cyclist. one page @num paragraph @num there is a sign that states rough road a head. one page @num paragraph @num it says  over the long onpiling hill.  he also the tempature as started on page @num and at the top of page @num paragraph @num   l was travling in hing desertd of california in june. these conditions of the setting all effect the cyclist.
3 the cyclist was riding in some rough, dry and abandoned terrain that made his journey almost fatal. he described it as,  in the high deserts of california in june.  it was dry, lifeless and hot the sun was beating on him and he needed to frequently drink water, but he was running out. the empty towns were what he was wanting on for fresh water, but they d been very abandoned. this made his journey very dangerous. he could ve fallen off at any time because of heat stroke he would ve died right then and there. his sweat was drying in the heat and there was no way for him to cool off in the lifeless desert: lifeless and dry. he had to enhance these extreme. ironical conditions for miles on end, just to find some water. it was all that a desert is and all that a home shouldn t go through.
1 when your doing any sport or any thing were you sweat your setting is everything. if your sweating in a setting you can easily get sick. the setting from the story rough road ahead the cyclist had no water and the setting was very hot. thats why the cyclist was tired and sick because he was sweating and had no water. thats how the setting affect the cyclist.
2 excitement, desperation, and self-pitty are all feelings the cyclist had because of the setting. he was really excited to get to yosemite park because of it peacefulness. he said,  the cool pines and rushing rivers of yosemite are calling my name.  he wanted to get their because it was so hot. he started getting desperate for water, so he drank out of this hot water hole.  i tried a drop or two, tasted like battery acid.  he was running out of water so he got desperate for some. he started to have self-pitty on his self,  sometimes life can be so cruel,  he was feeling pitty on himself because he had such a long way to go still. these are all feeling the cyclist had because of the setting.
1 the features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. one way is that the cyclist not sticking to his map. instead of sticking to his map he had asked a couple of old people. the old people that gave the cyclist directions also gave him a short cut to take. that s where the second effect came in where the cyclist started to use a shortcut instead of the main road. that s how the features of the setting affected the cyclist.   
1 in the essay, the description of the setting was dry, hot, very open, and desserted. the description could suggest lonlieness, obviously. even though the man was all alone and didn t know where he was going, he still persisted. while he thought about  the cool pines and rushing rivers of yosemite.  this thought kept him strong, so he kept trying.
2 when the cyclist first starts his journey he is very sure of himself. he sees everything as the old men told him. as he travels on he notices everything is abandoned and empty.  there was no one in sight not a building, car, or structure of any kind.  the man started becoming very unsure. you could tell he says  i wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn t a mirage, and tried not to get excited.  he was very doubtful he d get to where he was going. in the end he was very relieved he found a fishing spot with a bathroom and fresh water.  
3 the features of the setting affected the cyclist in this story alot. having unreliable directions, barely enough water for the journey, poor road conditions and other hazards like the heat and animals made this a very difficult journey for the cyclist. starting the journey the cyclist recieved bad information on how to get to his destonation which lead him on a long hard journey with not much water. he says in the story  the speed limit was @num. i was doing a water-depleting @num . this means he was running out of water too fast for the amount of land he was covering. another feature of the netting that affected him was that the road conditions got worse and worse untill he reached a high way late in his journey. he said  flat road was replaced by short rolling hills.  this means the faster, easy, to ride terrain was replaced by slower harder to ride on terrain. these features of the setting could have been very dangerous and maybe factal and affected the cyclist alot living this story. 
3 the features of the setting of  do not exceed posted speed limit  greatly impact the cyclist, in a negative way. for example, when the road changes from smooth and easy to rolling and full of hills. it makes it difficult for him to bike. he needs to use more energy to get over the hills. another example is when it says  tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me.  the connection with seeing a tumbleweed is that of being deserted and alone so this increased his feelings of despair. lastly, he sees the welch s grape juice factory, which is deserted and serves to only make him thirstier. all of these things affect the cyclist. the fact that he sees the grape juice factory is also ironic, because he is extremely dehydrated and the factory is abandoned.
2 the many features of the setting affected the cyclist in many different ways. the beauty of nature around him affected him by making him laugh. in the essay, it says,   on a gorgeous day in june caused him to laugh.  this shows, despite what happened, he was might are on a nice day outside giving him an optimistic attitude. also, the beating sun affected him in a different way. it caused him to sweat and almost die of dehydration.   growing realization that l could drop from heatstroke   this shows that he was tensely aware that he could die from the suns might. so, the settings around the cyclist affected him in different ways.
1 the settings effects the cyclist because in california it could be really hot sometimes. the cyclist could dehydrate on a long trip and pass out really get hurt. also there are a lot of hills which could be really hard on the cyclist.
2 the features of the setting affect the cyclist because real cyclist know what the speed is for a bike so you don t need to tell them. if a cyclist needed some dierections they would go to a gas station not to some old person s house. a real cyclist can go as long as they want before the stop because they are tired. a real cyclist knows haw to do tricks on a bike don t have to do them over and over again to be able to do them. a real cyclist doesn t have to train to go into a tourtement and win they must have to practice to be able to win.
3 in the narrative  do not exceed posted speed limit  by joe kurmaskie, the cyclist was affected in a deadly negative way by the setting. the cyclist is travelling through  the high deserts of california in june.  it was hot, so hot the infact, that the author realized he could  drop from heatstroke  at anytime. this unbearable heat, coupled with the  crippling  hilly terrain was enough to reduce the cyclist to a stale of severe dehydration. obviously not exactig a positive effect. the swelting heat and merciless hills of the setting would not be quite so awful if there had been locations to stop, rest and replenish the eyeishes diverting water supply. however,  there was no one in sight, not a building, or a structure of any kind  the cyclist was incomplete isolation for over @num miles of arid desert, the sweating sun heating down upon him as he toiled up steep unyielding hills clearly the setting was affecting the cyclist in horribly negative way.
1 on the way to @caps the cyclist was riding through dry, hot weather in rough terrain. this was making him tired and dehydrated. half way throgh his journey he couldn't see anything for miles. that must of been discouraging. all the way there he was dehydrated and when he found water it was @num degrees @caps because of the heat.
1 the feature of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. it it was a straight road, it would be smooth sailing. if the road was bumpy, he d jump up and down a little. if he was riding in the woods, it would be cool and a little dark. if he was riding in the desert, it would be very hot and bright.
2 the cyclist was eager to get to yosemite park he listened to the  old timers who haven t left the confines of thier porches since carter was in office . he went the way the old men told him to take. he went down a hill in to town which was empty into a hard road & snakes in his way then up a hill then went down the hill saw a abanded  welch s grape juice factory . then he saw a sign say  gary and wilber s fish camp-if you want bait for the big ones, we re your best bet! . so then he runs into the bathroom & drinks from the sink. before he got there he was getting thirsty & tired & when he saw the abanded building he saw a young boy drinking a juice he wiped his eyes to see if he wasn t seen a mirage. so then he sticks a few pebbles into his mouth. it read that sucking on stones help take your mind off thirst by allowing what spit you have left to circulate. then he left then a stone went his throat. his troubles, thirst, & fear were all behind him when he saw that sign.
1 some of the features like the change in landscape affected the cyclist. differing from flat land to miniture hills to highways is kind of hard to cope with, especially considering he was dehydrated and had no water.
2 there are a lot of things that effect the cyclist, such as the heat, having no water, the rough roads and the long trip. the cyclist is out in a desert so it is very hot. the narriation says,  and the growing realization that i could die drop from heatstroke  (kurmaskie @num). this means that he or she was very hot and dehydrated. the roads were very rough, for example,  rough road ahead: do not exceed posted speed limit  (kurmaskie @num). the roads became, bumpy, and there were a lot of hill the cyclist had to go over. there was no water either. so he/she was running out of energy and it made it even harder. in the end the cyclist survived and drank a lot of water.
2 in  do not exceed posted speed limit,  a cyclist follows some bad advice, which leads him on a tough ride through the desert with little water. the setting has a large effect on the cyclist because it causes him to be dehydrated, which presents the main conflict of the story.  the water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips,  the author states when his fresh water supply begins to run out. another factor the setting presents to the cyclist is the extreme heat of the california desert. this adds to the cyclist thirst and dehydration. the reader can tell it is unpleasantly hot when reading,  wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt , that i could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in june   the rough roads and challenging terrain also present a challenge to the cyclist that slows his advance to yosemite.
2 in the essay  rough road ahead: do not exceed posted speed limit,  the setting affects the story very much for many reasons. first, it is in the summer, so it is very hot. also, it is in the desert in the west, so there is a very warm climate already. third, there is not any civilization on the  shortcut  he follows, so there is no way for the author to get any water to replenish his body with. this is how the features of the setting affect the cyclist in the story.
1 in the story the fact that no one was around, there were no buildings, he had no water, and was lost. had a negative affect on the cyclist, he was doubting himself the whole time. although he did perserver and made it through the tough situation he was in.
2 in the story  rough road ahead  the setting and the features affect the cyclist. for example in the story he says  i d read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst by allowing what spit you had left to circulate . this shows that the features are rough because he would most likely not be that desperatly thirsty unless it was very hot out. the setting and features of this story is it takes place in california, on a hot day. another quote that could support the question is when the author says,  i wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn t a mirage.  this shows that it is hot because he is sweating. this also could show that it is hot because he thinks it s a mirage, and people usually see them in the desert, where it is hot.
2 there are many reasons as to why the features of the setting affects the cyclist. one reason is because it is so hot, i know this because it was sammertime in the california desert. another reason is because the road was very rough. i know this because of the sign that he saw that said  rough road ahead; do not exceed posted speed @num). this tells you that the road is very rough. and being that he is on a bike rough roads are not very good for him. another reason as to why the setting affects the cyclist is that there is no one to get directions from. there is no one around to give him a drink of water. these are few of the many reasons why the setting affects the cyclist.
2 the story  rough road ahead: do not exceed posted, speed limit   tells of a biking trip gone wrong. but the story would  not be as terrifying if it had happend in a different place. the setting plays a large role in the story. the story begins on a present summer evening but as the man bikes he arrives at ghost town devold of evil life, later feeling of double sets in when he arrives at  one ramshockle shed, severall rusty pumps and a corrol that couldn t hold these lamest mule.   later we fear panic set in as these terrain becomes hilly and tumbleweeds and snakes cross the path. like an cold wesstern. finally all  hope is lost when he reaches these grapes juice factory and find,  a sand blasted picture of a young boy,   the setting is a power full tool which greatly influences the cyclist.  
3 the features of the setting have a huge effect on the cyclist. there was a point in the story where he ran out of water ad he remembered that the old guys had sworn the next town was only eighteen miles down the rode. he was tired ad dehydrated but he thought he could make it along the road. so he started off and the two miles later the terrain changed and so did his outlook on this entire journey.  flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.  sometimes life can be so cruel.  @caps hills took a lot out of him and he was now on a highway. before this terrain change the rider is very positive and thinks he can do this easily.  i could make that!  but after the terrain change he looses hope and almost don t make it.  it didn t really matter. i was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.  it is obvious as you read that when the terrain becomes tough it has a huge negative effect on the cycilists.
1 the features of the setting effect the cyclist in a few ways. the roads were nice and smooth then turned to hills. it was a hot day in june and he had a sparse water supply with him. he was peddling through the desert s of california. the last thing that effected him was that there wasn t very many places to stop for water.
1 the features of the setting affect the cyclist because he is riding through the desert in the middle of june yet he has very little water. this affects him because he is thirsty but he doesn t have a lot of water to drink and he is in a desert in the middle of june which makes it very hot. also in the story it says he comes to welch s grape juice factory were on the side of the building he see picture of a  young boy pouring a refreshing a loss of juice into his mouth  this make the cyclist even thirstier but he continues one to find water at a bait shop.
3 the author concludes the story with that passage to show the importance of the inspiration saeng gets from the hibiscus plant. saeng, throughout the story was comforted by the hibiscus plant because it reminded her of home. the plant during the winter metaphorically explains: @caps attitude towards her new country and her driving test; the hibiscus plant in the winter is not as beautiful in the bitter cold, but it adapts and survives, and returns to its beautiful state in the spring. saeng is bitter about her new country and driving test, but is adapting, and will be inspired by the beautiful state of the hibiscus in the spring to try her test again. in conclusion, the author ended the story in that way to stress importance in the relationship between saeng and the hibiscus plant.
0 i think he concluded the story with paragraph cause then do thing in the story and the report it so when the geese left they will come back and leave again so that what i think i take the test again means.
2 the author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows how everything is changing and adapting to the change. saeng decides that with this change, she can also adapt to her new life by going back and passing the drivers test. the hibiscus also represents how something also from her homeland has come to america and must now survive. when it begins to bud, saeng will begin to start adapting to america by passing her drivers test. it s all about trying to become accustomed to changes. when saeng feels bad for failing, that s why something from her past is such a comfort to her.
3 by ending the story with the idea of retaking a test in the spring, the author sets a feeling of starting fresh and perservering . for example , when the author says  when the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding , she show the idea of starting a fresh new life in the spring by returning to their home and the hibiscus is starting fresh by  budding again. this is why spring is when saeng wants to start fresh and retake the test. the paragraph also shows that saeng, like the hibiscus, is perservering. the hibiscus is perservering by making it through the winter and blooming again while saeng   is perservering by retaking the test. the author ends with this paragraph to show that saeng is not going to give up.

3 in 'winter hibiscus' by @caps ho, the narrator never clearly indicates what test saeng has failed. however, through subject matter and word choice it is clear that the test is not only important to saeng and her mother, but also to her new life in @location. throughout the story saeng's longing for her homeland is over powering. the flood of memories that came back to her when she purchases the hibiscus, are obviously painful and part of her everyday life. saeng is working is working hard to keep her memories of vietnam alive, while knowing that she must learn to live the @caps customs and lifestyle. there are somethings she dosent need to change, like passing the test. saeng realizes that she can use these memories to keep her spirits alive, she can use them as motivation. this is why the last sentance of the story is so impowering, because she has learned to use the @num things together memory and change,  when    this hibiscus is budding i will take that test again      
1 the reason why the author ended with saeng vowed is because she is very commited. she failed the first time but know she really want to pass it so she is waiting until the snow melt and @caps geese return and this hibiscus is buddin @caps she will come back
0 i think that the author concluded the story like that because of who throw out the whole story the plot was in the winter. she might wanted to try it in a different season to see if she might to better with the whot setvation. that is why i think the author concluded the story like that.  
0 she concludes with this the story this paragraph because she wants @date to come again. she says  when the snow melts . she wants to look at the events again. and take care of them.
1 to her the hibiscus was a test. saeng felt she failed the test of letting go of the past and embracing  now.  the hibiscus reminded her of home, so she spent over @money on it, knowing she and her mother needed the money. essentaily, she felt as though she failed a test.
1 because withe the blooming of the hibiscuse plant comes new hope. in the story she sees the hibiscuse as her old life and with the budding of the plant starts a new chapter in the young girls life.
3 i believe there is a meaningful reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph. i think that the author will feel more confortable and ready to take the test. i was able to come to this conclusion because by waiting for winter to be over to take the test again, she is giving herself time to prepare. also, she is waiting for the hibiscus plant to bud. something. i was able to extract from the fact that she wants to wait for the hibiscus is the presence of confort, the whole story revolves around how saeng was able to confort herself by reminiscing on her past experiences in vietnam. when she feels that an important part of her life is returning, that she can become comfortable and focused. i think the author would conclude the story with this paragraph is because the author wants to stress the importance of this flower involving how saeng lives her life
1 in the story  winter hibiscus  by minfong ho. the author expresses how the girl believes with her memories and once she changes and adapts to the culture that s when she will have the courage to re take the test she failed that day. saeng misses her home so much and she can t grasp that their are similarities between her new home to her old home.  she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familar to her now . saeng didn t want to expect the move but noticeing that she won t forget any memories she starts to take on new memories. at first everything was so different now she is starting to remember things about her new home which is a sign of comfort to her.  she found that she was still too shaky to say the words at home, lest she burst into tears again.  with saeng s feelings of the change the ending paragraph lets the reader know that there is hope for moving on her knew home. she is gradually starting to gain confidence and she knows when she does she can take her test an succeed at it. the author shows how good change can be if your willing to adapt. everything might not always be as perfect as you know it to be but your courage will make a happy home with new and old memories, as saeng starts to relize during the last paragraph.
3 i believe the author of  winter hibiscus  used this for the last paragraph because it is saying when she sees that hibiscus it will give her memories of home again which will bring encouragement for the test.  the geese symbolize saeng's determination to pass the test and try like the new country. saeng explains,  she lifted her head and watched as their distinctive i was etched against the evening sky, slowly fading into the @num) this quote creates a vivid image in my mind that lets me know saeng will really go and take that test when she has encouragement from not only the geese but the hibiscus also.
1 the author uses this paragraph to @caps the story because it shows how saeng wants to adapt to this country and she is allready beging to understand it and like it. when it @caps  and this hibiscus is budding, then i will take that test again  it is a metaphor about herself when the @caps begins to bloom and @caps just as she is starting to bloom and @caps. this is why the author endeded with this passage.
1 the author concludes the story with this paragraph because he made a comittment to himself of taking the test all over again. he probably said that because there s always a next time for everything. mostly the reason he said it was to remind himself that theres always another try of everything. finally that most people such know that everyone get a second chance.
0 the author concluded like that because he was the one to score the lines below what you write. score of to level and key better. to all the thing he was surprised to kindly be seprated by for there by up so blese geve one a high sew o of will sweit all at you up to the end of the authrs concludes 
3 the author concludes the story with this paragraph because it lets the reader know that there is still a chance for saeng; she is not giving up on herself or the test. while reading you will find that saeng is comforted by memories of her homeland, and obviously this move to another country was hard on her. in the story the author writes,  it felt smooth and cool, with a hint of velvet toward the center- just as she had known it would feel.  the feeling and scent of the hibiscus flower comforted her. she then proceeded to purchase the plant, because she failed the test she needed something to lift her spirits back up once again. the author decided to end the story with saeng stating that once  this hibiscus plant is budding,then l will take that test again  because as the reader should have learned by now, the hibiscus plant has been the only positive aspect in her life since the move. it is giving her motivation to once again take the driver s test, and it is also letting the reader know that saeng is not giving up.
3 minfong ho concluded the story  winter hibiscus  with a strong paragraph to show the passion and will of saeng in her new home to complete the test. when the closing sentences states that saeng  vowed  to pass the test, it shows her determination to fight. this will could be from the memories of her grandmother and the flowers that reminded her so closely of her old home. saengs courage to face her homesickness is the seed of the story, and by ending it with such a bold statement, minfong ho blooms this seemingly sad tale into a story of willpower and drive to pass her test.  winter hibiscus  is a passage of heartache, despair, and yerning for a past life. by closing the story with the uplifting promise from saeng, minfong ho puts a happy ending to a possibly sad tale.
1 the author ends the story with this paragraph show is that saeng is willing to try again to try to get a plant that will remind her of her grand mother and  remind her of her old home where she @month go back one day . so, she can see the near flower she loves and not the take   one.
0 what l think the author was talking abount snow and it was add outside for the bays matter and snow started to melted.
1 he concluded the story with that sentence because it told that she learned a lesson in life. all the way back home where she originally came from she missed her friends ibet and seeing her mother work out in the garden durring this time of year when its cold. i guess there poor in one way. in conclusion the choose this sentence because it sounds like she learned a lesson in life and even starting all over again but with a better understanding in her learning.
1 these are a few reasons why the author concluded the story this way. the first reason is that most of the story is written in the way of a serious and stright forward tone and ending the story with a quote or riddle. makes the reader have to think about the conclusion. it would be the same if he just  ended with what happened so he just added something that made you think a little more than a normal conclusion. the author ended the story with  when they come back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and its hibiscus is budding, then i will take that test again.  because it was different.
2 the author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows that a new begining is starting  for example the fact that they moved to a different country. thats what the author means when the spring comes. spring represents a new life which is what saeng & her mother are doing. also the snow represents a blanked of the past / hard times. last but not least when the hibiscus starts to bud that also means a new beganing. so if you put it all together you get the hard times going away when the snow melts & then a new beginning when spring starts & the flower buds  that is why the author put this paragraph in the story because they needed a fresh start.
0 the author concludes the story with this paragraph because saeng failed to get a certain plant because it died but winter is over in spring is here it s her chance to get that flower. for example in the story it says saeng broke down and wept. it was already dusk when saeng reached home. it s not her fault because in the story, it says the wind was blowing harder, tearing off the last remarks of green and chicory weeds. the concludes because it will be a next time when you see saeng again with a beautiful plant in her hand.
1 the author concludes the story with this paragraph because saeng has vowed to retake the test in the spring and will have more confidence when the snow melts, the geese return, and the hibiscus starts budding.  a wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung saeng s eye now swept over her.   saeng feels lonely because she is from a different country and misses everything she knew and loved. now she has the hibiscus to remind her of home.
2 the author concludes with this sentence because it shows that saeng is going to try to adapt to her new home. he lets you know that saeng is not gonna grieve and be sad anymore, but she will adapt and continue on with her life. the author adds this:  i mean, not like the kind we had at-at- .this is when saeng has just come home and talked to her mother and she is very sad because she thought about old memories at her old home, but by adding the last statement of the story it shows taht saeng has decided to move on with life and no longer be sad. she has set a goal to accept it. this is the reason for the author to conclude this story like he does.
2 in the short story  winter hibiscus  by minfong ho i think the author ends with that paragraph because it shows that she is determined to pass.  when they come back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts, and the geese return and the hibiscus budding, then i will take the test again.  this shows she is determined because geese migrate every year and flowers always bud every year. she will keep coming back just like the geese and the hibiscus do. she will be determined to pass the test and fit in sooner or later. if she was not determined she might never pass and fit into her new society.
1 the author chose to conclude the last paragraph with the story to show that she has not given up. it shows that she has not given up because it says  overhead...geese...honk...familiar to saeng now (second to last paragraph).  @caps when she buys the hibiscus, because, it holds many memories from home, to keep her going. her mother still making an  omelet with slices of bitter melon  made her math water, @caps reminding her of home, gave her hope to not give up.
1 the author concludes the story by saying that when the geese come back in the spring then she will try to pass the test. so say that if at first you don t sucede, try try again. also the author concludes with that to show that saeng has been in the @location for some years and that she still misses her home back in vietnam.
2 the author most likely concludes this story with the quote because she has renewed hope. she was feeling really upset because she had failed the driving test and when she saw the hibiscus flower, she got even more emotional because she misses her home but when she sees the geese as she finishes planting the flower, she decides she s going to try to retake the test next spring.
2 she ends with that paragraph because it starts over. when the geese came back and the hibiscus is budding its like restart and she can try again, dealing with her memories of home and her adaption to the new country. i think she will be able deal with it better and take it again, it shows that she wont give up.
3 it is clear that saeng is in the midst of struggle during a time of homesickness after recently moving from vietnam. but as time goes on she will learn to balance the affection she feels for both her new country and homeland. as saeng moves through the story it is apparent that she longs for memories of her homeland, but is beginning to find new things to enjoy about her new home. for example, while she is touched by the memories aroused by the hibiscus flower, she is intrigued by the new experiences, such as eating big @caps and new friends. while homesickness has caused her to struggle she knows that with time she will be able to overcome the obstacle of leaving the old ways, for the new without completely obliterating either. she is convinced that by spring she will be able to overcome this obstacle and have the confidence to pursue any that will arise in her future.    
0 saeng is talking about flowers coming back in the spring time. she is vowing to take the test again after the snow is gone and she is going to do it agin.  the wind was blowing harder, tearing of the last remnants of green in the chicory weeds that were growing.  so she cant wait until it is spring agin. so she can try to plant agin.
3 mingfong ho concludes  winter hibiscus  with the paragraph, when they come back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then i will take that test again.  this ending paragraph shows that saeng will not give up in her struggle to adapt in this new place. saeng has been going throug hard times; moving to the united states and failing her driver s test. in the greenhouse saeng even breaks down and crys. the hibiscus flower that saeng bought cost the family a lot of money, but to saeng it was very important. this flower represented hope. when the flower buds again it would be the right time to take her driver s test. the flower also represents adapting to a new place. as saeng  adapts to the united states, the hibiscus adapts to the new garden. 
2 the author ends the story with this paragraph to show how saeng changed. saeng didn t want to take the test and she had no confidence. in the story saengs mother supports her no matter what. she even understood when saeng bought a plant for @money because it reminded her of home. now that saeng has been comforted she feels more relaxed and she is ready and more confident to take the test again. therefore saeng has changed.
1 the author ends the story with this paragraph because he wants the reader to feel like she is going to accomplish something because of the hibiscus and the geese. an example of her accomplishing something because of hibiscus is when the author mentions how her and her grandmother use to spend time together and do things together and her grandmother would do her hair and then put a hibiscus flower into it. also the geese are a sing of accomplishment because she sees them in the sky flying south so they can survive the cold winter months in a warm place.

2 if you have ever had to move from your home town or country, you how comforting something can be that s from your old country and in your knew one. the fact that saeng had geese and plants and everything else comforted her enough to know that next spring she can take the test. throughout the story it seemed as if everything that saeng ever saw that she had in her home country of vietnam in some way warmed and comforted her. early in the story it illustrates her feelings as she makes her way through the green house many times in the story you could always  hear  that sense of love when she would call plant by its native languages name. throughout the story you could always sense the love and caring she had. the author knows how she loves those things and that they would encourage her. therefore that s why he concluded the story as such. 
2 the author concludes this paragraph with the story because of the potintal of the hibiscus. so saeng will go take the test again no matter she already took it and failed. she is like the hibiscuc. the hibiscus seems out of place and is determined to survive when the snow melts. so she will go take the test again and us the hibiscus as her modifation.
0 the concludes the story way because that the way he want for the gril to end it. cause she all about them flowers, plant, animals. she likes madagascar periwinhle. the places went she use to live is gorse with plants, animals, flowers.
1 i think the author includes this to show the determination to pass this test no matter what.
2 the girl says that she is going to take the test again when the hibiscus blooms shows that she misses her country and still wants to be connected somehow. when she takes the test as the plant blooms its like support from her country. the plant is symbolic of her progress because her growth is like the plant. when she first got it she wast ready to go out and do things she still hadnt adapted lutlly to the environment just like the hypiscus wast adapted to the wather and had to wait till @date to bloom.
2 all throughout the story  winter hibiscus , the author gives the feeling as hope and comfort that is obtaned by saeng when she thinks about the past. and to continue this feeling as hope, the last sentence gives the feeling that saeng will be better off than she had been at the beginning of the story. for example, at the beginning of the story, saeng was feeling alrenated, alone, and misplaced in her new country. but as the story progresses, she starts to develop peace of mind and certainly that her future will be brighter with the passing of the and her growing confidence. in conclusion, the author uses the last sentence to give a feeling of hope for saeng s future and growing confidence.
1 the author concludes the story with that paragraph because he wants to show that the flower was her inspiration to take the test before. the way i got my response was, throughout the story, @person was always either gardening the hibiscus or had one. this obviously showed me that she was inspired by this flower and its beuty. in conclusion, the author ends the story like this to show the importance of the hibiscus flower to saeng.
1 the author concludes this story with this paragraph to show the aduiance that saeng @caps gave up so you should'nt either. i think that this paragraph is describin a law of life witch is  @caps give up.  @caps even though she had failed at first she is still willing to try again.
2 in the story  winter hibiscus , i think that the author concludes the story in  when they come back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is dudding, then i will take that test again  because she has made saeng feel that if that hibiscus can restart and make new flowers the saeng should do the same. therefore thats why the author added that quet to the end of the story
2 the author concludes the story with the sentence  when they come back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then i will take that test again.  because that winter hibiscus symbolizes a new beginning for her. for example back in her home town she had hibiscus's and everything was fine and normal, she lived her life and so on, well then she moved to the u.s, and she didn t have any hibiscus, she just failed her driving test, she feels miss placed, and doesnt fit in. so, when she saw that winter hibiscus she felt as if she found something to help her feel at home or at ease almost. she felt a sense of security in conclusion the author ended with that sentence because its a new beginning for her and that hibiscus means a new start.
2 the  author concludes  the  story  with  the  paragraph    when  they  come  back  ,  saeng  vowed  silently  to  herself  in  the  spring  ,  when  the   snow  melt  and  the  geese  return  and  this  hibiscus  is  budding  ,  the  i  will  take  the   test  again ,   because  the  author  started  out  the  story  after  saeng  failed  her  driving  test  .  saeng  is  reminded  from  the  hibiscus  about  her  homeland.  after  saeng  wanted  the  hibiscus  in  the  garden  ,   a  flock  it  canada geese  flow by  ,  as  they  flew  by  saeng  felt  a  sign  at  comfort  and  vowed  to  herself  what  started  everything  .  if  saeng  did  pass  the  driving  test  then  she  would  of  never  found  the  hibiscus.
0 the author concludes the story with this paragraph because it is a personification involving snow smelting, geese returning, and the hibiscus budding. it s explaining moments in time. the author describes how isolated the hibiscus is.
1 i think the reason why the author ended the story with this  when they come back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding. then i will take that test again.  paragraph because like this the plant didn t have a fight chance for survival in the winter and was same with the girl when she took her driving test but in spring the plant has chance bloom so she has a chance to pass the test because because there time and place for everything.
1 i think the author of  winter hibiscus  said  when they come back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, the i will take the test  again.  to conclude the story for many reasons. first reason is it shows that she isn t giving up. the second reason is it gives a feeling of hope of whats to come. the last reason is it leaves us wondering if she makes it next time. that is probably why the author ended it that way.
2 this last paragraph is written for several reasons. first, she will try again when she feels the time is right. just like the geese coming back, saeng will comebak to take the test, and so the hibiscus plant will also bloom again. she feels that it is the right thing to do and it will be the right time to come back and take the test. this pharagraph describes saeng well about how she lives and how she will take the test again when she feelsit is right.
0 the author concludes the story with a paragraph so the people reading the story would actually read it and not guess how the story is goin to go.
2 the author concludes the story with this paragraph to show determination. it shows that saeng wants to take her time to adjust to her new life and her  new surroundings. then she thinks it might feel more like this place is becoming a home. she feels that maybe, if shes been used to this new place for awhile she will have a better chance at passing the test. she is determined to pass the test.
3 the author concludes the story with that paragraph for many reasons. the author wanted to convey a sense of hope to show the growth of her character, and to show how thing are  going to change. in the last paragraph when she vows that she will take that test again it gives you a sense that everything will be okay. earlier in the story she had been crying and missing her homeland the tone was troubled and sad. this last paragraph suggests that the tone is now hopeful. even though she failed the test she is still going to try again. the author also put the paragraph to show how much her character has grow. saying that she will try again shows how much stronger determed she is lastly, she had the story end with that paragraph to foreshadow what is to come.the geese coming back and the snow melting, and the hibiscus budding all show a change in the seasons. this represents the change that has occurred in her and it foreshadows that things will be different from now on.
1 the author concluded the story with that message is because if you think about it. if not that seems all the whole story and leavs a opening for a requal. it's ovious that whole point of the story is to make you think.
3 the author concludes with this paragraph because the narrarator is now willing to accept and adapt to her new environment like the flower and the flower would do. geese like the warm and not the cold so they are flying south for the winter. saeng s  comfort tone  is in @location where she has many childhood memories; including her grandmother and the hibiscus flower. she is used to the flower being in a warm environment. so, when the geese come back in the spring and when the flower blossoms again, she will be ready to adapt to @caps life more and take her drivers test. the geese and the hibiscus flower are a symbolic memory of her old home in @location which she misses very much. after these things come to try and adapt to @caps ways of life. 
0 i think the author concludes that paragraphs to show more meaning of the story.the author could of wanted to show more details in the story.
2  when they come back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then i will take that test again.  is the paragraph that the author uses to conclude the story. in the my opinion the author includes this paragraph to conclude the story in order to show saeng is committed to adjusting  to her new home and to leaving her old one. for example, in the story saeng was unable to say  i mean, not like the kind we had at home.  without bursting into tears. this illustrates her sorrow and inability to let go of her past.
1 i believe the author uses this as the last paragraph because it tells of how saeng wants to overcome and be strong even though. she misses her home. for example saeng believed that since she cried when she saw the hibibiscus plant she failed and she believes she will get stronger over time.  
2 in the story  winter hibiscus , saeng had failed her drivers test and as she is walking home she spies a flower that reminds her of what once her home. she buys the flower and returns to her new home to her mother who is working in the garden. they decide to plant the flower in the garden, and when the flower was planted, a flock of geese fly over head, saeng then realizes that everything is familier to her now, when everything was quite strange to her. she concludes the story saying when the geese come back in the spring, she will take the test again. she says that the flower will be buckling which means blooming or growing, and she will have been grown and familiar to everything then, so she will be ready for the test when the geese as ready to come home and the hibiscus is ready to bloom
3 the  author  concludes  the  story  of  paragraph  with the paragraph because it show the connection of nature and the girl. the paragraph says,  when the snow  melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then  i will take that test again (no @num).in spring when all of these events take place. spring is the  sign  of  life  and  birth  or  renewal. the geese come back. they are  renewed  in a symbolic sense. when the snow melts you can see the grass again which is a sign of life. when plants bud they are born. the  character  decides  when  nature  is symbolically reborn  and  renewed she  will start again just like nature.
0 because they wanted to get it done with so they made the end like the first part of the story i like the part when the birds came back they got some of the flower come back to them.
1 the author concludes the story with that paragraph, because she is making a promise to herself to take the test again so she can pass it. she will do it when it is spring with the hibiscus is budding. she need to take the test and start driving. i think that is a good thing to when people vowed thing to themself.
2 the author concludes the story with this paragraph because it has meaning. the author is saying that when these animals and living creatures get their chance she too, will get hers. for example, the geese will get to return, the hibiscus will get it's chance to bud and she will get her chance to take her drivers test. i know this because saeng s mother starts talking about how great the plant will be in the spring. she even says,  but its strong enough to make it through the cold months . this indicates that the mom is trying to tell her that she will get a second chance. that is why the story ends with that sentence.
3 in my opinion, the author concludes the story by saying that she will retake the drivers test because not only will she take the drivers test again, but she will also be more comfortable in her life. the drivers test is not the main problem, it s adapting to her new environment that is causing saeng so much heartache. for example,  in lines @num saeng s thought s are  a wave of loss so deep and strong stang saeng s eyes now and swept over her  and  in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, saeng brake down and wept.  this piches that saeng is having trouble readjusting to her new life and is reminded of her old memories from where she used to live and cries because it s gone. i think that failing her drivers test was just little thing that finally caused her to cry because of the stress, and when she said   and this hibiscus is budding, i will take that test again.  it means that she will overcome all that and move on.
2 the story  winter hibiscus  is written by minfong ho. the author ended the story with this excerpt,  when they come back,  saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then i will take the test again.  the reason for this is so she will have time to adjust. saeng just needs a little comforting because all of this is new to her. this words use figurative language because the geese reminded her of herself,  almost familiar to her now. like geese.   
2 the author concludes the story with  when they come back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then i will take that test again,  to show that she will try again with a new start. when she see s the flower the clerk tells her it is the hibiscus. the hibiscus brings back memories of her childhood. she then takes it home and shows the plant to her mother. her mother replies with a  you what?  hearing her daughter tell her how much it is. with the hibiscus bringing something of importance she acquires more hope. by saying she will start once the flower has bloomed and the geese have returned, she means she will try again with a new and frash start.
2 the author concluds the story with this paragraph to show that next spring she will have anoter chane. the author shows that saeng will relate to the blooms or the hybiscus plant and take the test again. the author does this to leave a clif haber and it shows there is more to saeng s life but it is still to come. in the story saeng is trys to get used to change and that she is have a hard time. her moter holes cheer her up but just like the winter comes. saeng will have next spring to take the divers test again.
1 the author s conclusion explains her feels. the authors conclusion saids to me  when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then i will take that test  again , what means is that she is a newoman. for example, taking the test means that she will change. also what it means is that she ready to take on new thing. for instance, the test to her is getting ready to take on a new thing. thats what i got from the conclusion. 
2 the author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows that when she sees the things from her home and living, it will comfort her in what she does. the author seems like she needs things from her homeland that help her make the best of things and bring back good memories of earlier life. i think that whenever i want to do a good job it helps to think of the good  things that mean alot to me so i will be happy and want to do good. the author is smart to want to see those things for her to retake her test because if she sees her plant doing well and sees the memory of the geese again it will be good luck for her.

3 this was a very interesting story and it snowed all the hardships this young girl has gone through, the author ended it in a very interesting way. when they ended the story i thought to myself how nice it ended. if think the author did a very nice job. she made it so that she snowed all the hard ships that saeng had gone through, as if they were the harsh winter. then as the author said,  as the snow melts away;  ,i think this shows how even though saeng  problems seem never ending and harsh, that one day they will be gone and things will become beautiful again, like the flower budding. in the spring time. also she did a nice job because throughout the story i could feel her pain. i felt as if i was there with her because of her use of descriptive  words like,  exploding, shock ,intense  and others to describe how much of a sudden was everything was. then when she ended it, it was like she was showing us saeng s hope for a better future, even though things aren t the way they were back home!
2 the author concludes the story with the paragraph -  when they come back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then i will take the test again.  (@num) because she feels that when the hibiscus blooms she can too bloom by passing the test. also saeng is relating herself to the hibiscus.  its  flower arn t as pretty, but it s strong enough to make it throu in here, this winter hibiscus.  (@num) her mother is trying to tell her she can be strong also. she too can make it through the cold months.  like the geese she lifted her head and watched as their distinctive v was etered against the evening sky, slowly fading into the distance.  (@num) just like the geese saeng is realizing to be proud of herself and there will be other chances. don t always doubt yourself becase they will be other chances. don t be afraid to try again.
1 he author concludes this paragraph in this story because it sounds good and to show the people he is writing it to that no matter what happend s to you in life you should just keep on doing what you think is best for you. just like the flower she keeps coming back for more after going through all that s tuff. 
1 the author concludes the story this way for many reasons. one reason is to show saeng is not going to give up and keep trying to pass her test. another way is to show that even though your life has changed that don t mean that you have to give up. these are some of the way that the author concludes the story like he does.
1 i think the author concluded the story with this paragraph because they wanted to show that she is comited to her nature especially to the hibiscus. she thought that the hibiscus was special because of what she did with it. like when they said  she reached out and touched petal gently. it felt smooth and cool, with a hint of velet toward the centre . and that s why i think the author concluded the story with this paragraph.  
2 the author, minfong ho, concludes the story with saeng vowing to take the test in the spring when the geese return, the snow melts, and the hibiscus is budding. this is done to symbolize the many things that saeng learnt. for example, she learnt she has to adjust to changes in her life and becoming familiar to the new things. the geese and snow she admits are the things that were  strange before  and  had become familiar to her now . the hibiscus also represents something and has a reason for being included in the last paragraph. it represents the ability to overcome obstacles, connection to the past, and comfort when needed. the last paragraph symbolizes many things, and if you look into it deeply, you will learn what saeng learnt.
1 saeng vowed siletly to herself  in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then i will take that test again  because her mind went of the track from think about a flower. she says   one of the blossoms had fallen off  then carefully saeng picked it up and smelled it. it happ distracted her mind. her promisreaction from tailing was silentess for a long moment and didn't say nothing. her never got mad. all she did was brushing the fragments of green off saeng's hands. her mother was mainly thinking about the plants as the day went, saeng dug out a hole and carefully lowered the 'winter hibiscus  into it. seeing her mother caused a reaction of ideas, so trying to etch a image of geese. she sent a goat to retake the driving test again as she was getting use to her new. the intro says  saeng, a teenage girl and her family have moved to the united states from vietnam. it never mentioned about her family 
3 i think that the author uses this quote,  when they come back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is buding, then i will take the test  again.  @caps it symbolizes that spring brings new life and hope.  but where was the home thought come? the hibiscus hedge? the way her gentle grandmother?   boat ride into the night and it was gone.  @caps from vietnam to @location. one night she had so much hope, like, abundance, then the next she is in foreign land that is nothing like her old home. the flowers bloom in the spring bringing new life. there is a chance to move on @caps there is hope. there is hope that spring will come, flowers will come birds will come. it is a chance to let go. the ending quote was said to bring hope and like to her and she sort of promises to herself that it will get better. hope is what makes every obstacle to get over easier and everything to be bearable. 
0  when they come back, saeng vowed silently to herself ,in the spring ,when snows melt and geese return and  this hibiscus is budding ,then i will take the test again  . the author concludes the story with this paragraph because this makes you think about the story after your done reading it.
1 he concludes this story like that so you dont feel as if she was defeated. she is now more aware or believes she can complete the task. also she has more selfconcious in herself because of the flower and now it reminds her of her home.
2 i think minfong ho concluded her story  winter hibiscus  the way she did to show the avid determination of saeng, the main character. she failed the test but she got the hibiscus and it helped her to restore her resolve to pass the test. now that she had a moments of her homeland and her family there she was most likely reminded that they would ve wanted her to succeed, and so she promises herself that she will take that test again when the hibiscus plant starts budding. this is why i feel that  winter hibiscus  was concluded in this way.
2 the author concluded this paragraph in this story because i think that he is tring to tell the reader a message. the author is tring to say that if a plant can mak it through the cold winter then she can pass her driver s test. that is why i think the author included that paragraph. 
2 the author added it in at the end not only to make the story have a happy, hopeful ending, but to show the reader that saeng slowly adjusted to the changes in life. the paragraph above explains that saeng realized that  the many things that seemed strange before had become,... almost farmiliar to her now.  so the author lastly concludes that eventhough she failed the test this time, just as the geese will return in the spring, then she can take the test again. she just the point of the story across and its a  cheerful  way to end it.
1 the author ends the story likes this so readers can understant the theme. which is, you can always start over, after a mistake is made. for example saeng failed herb driving test and then it took a toll on her she will try again in the spring. i guess she figures that once she once she has renewed  herself she'll do better.
1 the author concludes the story with this paragraph because the hibiscus is motivating her to test for her drivers test. in the spring, when the snows melt, the geese return, and the hibiscus is budding, then she will take that test again. 
2 several reasons, first, in spring she will have had more time to adjust to her new life. also when the hibiscus starts budding she will feel conforted, as though it auomaticaly brings back her childhood memories. it also is a link to her past home in vietnam. when the hibiscus adjusts to its new life in ground soil, she will adjust and be ready to take the test again. its as if, when the plant is ready to start budding, she will also be ready.     
2 the author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows that saeng is getting used to living in a new place. towards the end of the text, saeng says that many things she thought were strange before had become familiar to her. the winter hibiscus was comforting, and reminded saeng of her home. she says  in the spring when the snows melt  because she is beginning to get used to  the quiet repetition of season upon season . the geese, which form a distinctive v are becoming familiar to her. the last paragraph is an effective way to end the story because it shows that saeng is becoming accostumed to her new surroundings and is hopeful the future.     
0 i think saeng need to take the test over because to get her grade up. saeng be waring about the snow, in the spirng because she is think about the flower getting cover over it. saeng mother late her help with the pepper and melons, and lat her state dinner.
1 the author conclude this saying it to the story because he thought it would go because at valkay about how the hibisuse a yet budding in the winter & and how all at the geese will return to the home and stay there because they hate the winter.  
2 the author concludes the story using that paragraph for a few reasons. one reason why is because the change in saeng s attitude. in the beginning of the story saeng is upset and has no hope of adjusting to her new home, but by adding that paragraph at end of the story it shows that she has hope, and she s not going to give up. another reason why this paragraph concludes the story is to show that life does go on in toughest situation. the fact that a new season will begin figuratively shows saeng will not always feel this way that she too will change. in conclude the story with that paragraph for a few good reasons.
2 the author must likely intended to show the hopeful enlightenment of saeng's complex dilemma. in the phrase,  when they come back  the author must likely refers to the hibiscus flowers that represent the fond memories of her homeland. the author illustrates saeng's struggle adapting to her new life through a  test  of planting the buds just as she had done back home with her grandmother. this test represents the achievement of adaptation to her new life. for that reason, the author concluded her story with the paragraph indicating saeng will indeed take that test again.
1 the author of this story concludes the story with a paragraph basically stating that the winters coming things are going to die off then come back next spring. shes refering to the plant. i think she is basically keeping track of the memories it left her and the thoughts that came to mind when she used her senses to connect with the flower. saeng is ancious to see how the flower buds next spring and what other new things she @month experience.
1 well i think the author concludes the story like that because he is showing her her attitude better known now she is changing so she is going to put her mind to whatever she has to do and she is going to take the test again with some pride and try in the spring when the snow goes away.
2 the young girl saeng from the story  winter hibiscus  by minfong ho, has moved from her home land of vietnam to the united states. the young girl was hoping to get her drivers license but failed, the hibiscus she sees comforts her reminding her of vietnam. when she purchases it her mother is concern of the price but sees how home sick her daughter is and becomes understanding. after planting the hibiscus she watches the geese and understands that every year they change their habitat. the geese inspire saeng along with the hibiscus and promises herself that  in the spring when the snow melts away the geese return and thes hibiscus is budding, then i will take the test again.
1 the auther concluded the story with this paragraph because this shows that saeng is willing to change and she wants to do so by the time spring comes. by change saeng wants to feel comfertable in @location and be able to remember things from where she used to live and not have to break down and cry. also the author use the geese because they need to leave home earely year and they deal with it so saeng can deal with it as well.
2 the reason why the author ends the story with that statement is because when you fail at something you need time to dust yourself off and try again. when saeng fails her driving test she is disappointed. after failing her test she went too greenery where she saw flowers of her homeland. then where sh bought the hibiscus. it reminded her of how things were different. and how thing change when you go to different place. sometimes they aren't so pleasant at first but you get use to them. like when she first saw the geese flying in a  v . she though of how strange it was. but now it is farmiliar to her. after failing her driving test saeng learns that even though things nav change she needs to be able to try again. 
2 i believe that the author concludes the story with this paragraph for many reasons. one being the fact that she wants to snow sympathay for the hibiscus. another reason would be showing that saeng wants to make her mother very proud of her. meaning that she doesn t want her mom to think that she is going to give up. this also contributes to the reason that saeng believes in herself and she truly thinks she can pass the test. lastly i think that this last paragraph snowed how saeng wants people to know that even some as small and meaning less as a plant can help her overcome obsticles, and lead her to her dreams. the author chose this paragraph to end the story because of the main fact that how we know that saeng will not stop believing in herself.    
2 by ending the story in the way the author has in the short story  winter hibiscus,  the author provides a sympathetic understanding for the reader of seang at her struggle to live in another country & her sadness of wishing to be back home. i think the author was attempting to end the story with a strong feeling for a strong note of saeng's personality to draw the reader back into what they had just read. for example, by repeating statement on the test saying   i will take that test again,  the author gives us that understanding that saeng has not given up & lets the reader know she will stand & live strong.
2 the reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is becaus now she has something to work for. the author could have also put this concludes the story with this paragraph becaus she must wait that long till she can take it again also saeng could wait to wait to see the plant grow and get bigger and stronger. they are reasons why i think the author put that conclude with the paragraph.
2 i think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because new beginnings.what i mean by this is,the hibiscus represents new beginnings.she says  when the hibiscus is budding ,then i will take the test again  .this will be a new start for her  .the plant  blooming makes her happy and reminds her of her grandmother.she s saying by the time the spring comes around she  would be ready for a  new obstacle as so for the hibiscus plant.
1 the author concludes the story with that paragraph because it shows that character will retry what she failed. in the story the character loves gardening so when her favourite plant comes back she will retry to pass her test.
1 the author most likely concludes the story with this sentence because it shows how dedicated the author and her child are to gardening. i am guessing that the young childs favoriteplant is the hibiscus. i think that the mother and her childs favorite thing to do together would be gardening. this is a nice way to end a story. it gives the read kind of a look of question on their faces. it leaves them suspicious of why the author did that. but in my opinion i think it adds some curiosity to the story.
2 primarily why she said that was she was saying with time come s cause. she was basically saying in a while when things change again she believes that her performance could change as well. i depicted this by the idea you can tell that she is beginning to sit over missing her home in vietnam and that is memory with time change comes along. that is a simple aspect of logic that with time comes chase. but i think as much i did properly interpret the aspect of what this is supposed to mean overall. but otherwise and finally i believed saeng said this because time brings change.
1 the author concludes with this because she is determined to pass the driving test that she had previously failed. for example, she writes  she vowed silently to herself.  when you vow to do something it usually means that you are very determined to do something. everything else that she says after that she really means it. therefore, that is why the author concludes with this sentence, in order to show her devotion to her goal.
2 i belive that the author conclude the story with this because he is saying that she will keep trying and will not give up and will keep on trying. i say this because she just moved to america from vietnam and is having a hard time adjusting to life in america. i think the geese represent something that is always  changing their surroundings and when they come she is going to fly again to get her licence.  
2 i believe the author concluded the story with  when they come back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the gesse return and this hibiscus is budding, then i will take the test again.  because it shows the entire theme of the story. the theme of this story is adjusting to things in life. the conclusion demonstrats this when she says she will take the test again. the hibiscus allowed her to get over the changes in life. for example  the familiar fragrance filled her lungs, and saeng could almost feel the light strands of her grandmother's long grey hair.  the hibiscus was something from home that gave her good memorys. the hibiscus encouraged her to except her new life and keep trying to make it better. 
3 the author ends the story with the given paragraph to get across. it highlights the things important and familiar to saeng that gave her comfort, and uses them to essentially say that she ll take the test over again once she feels better. the winter hibiscus was a plant that saeng remembered of life back home up to the story, so when she sow the plant ,  a wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung saeng  s eyes now swept over her.  saeng was unable to comfort her emotions when she first saw the plant because she realized how much she missed her old life. the plant is mentioned in the final paragraph because when it blooms in the spring, the winter hibiscus will help fill the emotional void, and help saeng to try to take the test again. she also mentions the geese for the same reason, but in a different way. unlike the winter hibiscus, it took a while for the geese to become,  through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now.  saeng mentions this so that she can get used to the strange and unfamiliar parts of her life, and to come to grips with her failed test. therefore by mentioning   the things she does in the last paragraph, saeng uses familiar objects, foreign and domestic, to illustrate her coming to grips with her failure.
1 i think the author concludes this in the story because. it is a key information for this story. because. it is dealing with her mom. she loves to work on the garden and become a garden and have a really job. like her mom
2 the reason that the author had ended the story the way she did was to leave the reader on the last thought. also it symbolizes rebirth. when saeng says,  ... this hibiscus is budding ...  (ho @num). she is also describing that they will start over when spring comes. and that leaves the reader with the last thought about saeng, and how she has overcome living in the new place. lastly, it ties up @caps feelings and experiences the whole time she had moved,  ... i will take the test again  (ho @num), which tells the reader she will continue to give her new home a shot. in conclusion, the reason for this quote being the last paragraph is to show that saeng will continue to try to overcome ??? (words not @caps) 
1 the author concludes the story with this paragraph. because when the hibiscus started budding it will give her inspiration to try and past the test again. in order to past the test she wanted to feel like she was home, and to have memories of her home to incourage her to try again. therefore, this is the reason the author concludes the story with the last paragraph.
0 she will go back to where she started. its a circle and she will be back the next year where she began.
1 no image
2 the author ends the story by saying  when they come back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then i will take the test again.  she chooses to end like this to show the change of the mood throughout the story. when she gets home her mother  noticed the tear staie on her daughter s cheeks and her puffy eyes.  saeng felt sad and out of place in the beginning of the story but by the end she felt happy and optimistic. 
2 the author concludes with this paragraph because it fits along with a lot of the story and sums it up well. in the story the hibiscus means a lot to saeng. durring the story she relates a lot of memories to the hibiscus. it reminds her of her home and her past so it plays an important role. when she planting it it s winter and the hibiscus hasen t bloomed yet. so by saying that she will take the test again when it is budding is like saying she will take the test again when its budding again. she is pretty much acting the same as the flower once again showing its importance. and thats why i think the author ended with that paragraph.
2 the author concluded  winter hibiscus  with this paragraph to emphasize a new life and new chances for the main character. the future setting of the paragraph, spring, symbolizes rebirth & another start from the cold, hard winter. the author takes this to heart including, more events which enhance this symbolized meaning. the author has uses structured choice to carry her toughts. recreate, when to convey the theme of rebirth, the author uses words like  the gesse return  and  take the test again  which add to the importance at the home. also, the literal action of the  hibiscus is budding  @caps rebirth. in winter the plant is dormant & less colorful, but in the spring the plant shows rebirth through about color in its buds. the author finally conveys the theme of rebirth by ending with this paragraph.
2 in  winter hibiscus , the author concludes with saeng saying  i will take that test, again, it means that saeng will be ready as soon as the spring arrives and her hibiscus is all in bloom. when saeng bought the hibiscus, she was sure that as soon as the winter passes with the coming of spring, she is sure that taking the drivers test, again will be easier to overcome the fear and grieving times in a new place. this means that saeng is able to overcome her fear of a new place. this means that saeng is able to overcome her fear of a new place. saeng is also sure that the memories of her homeland will help her, too. in the end, its revealed that saeng has become strong and has high hopes to see her success be fulfilled in her new homeland.
2 the authors choice of the last paragraph in the short story,  winter hibiscus shows the hope for the future that seang feels. the winter and cold represent how she feels out of place and upset at not receiving her driver s license. in the spring she will have a piece of her homeland blooming and she will be warm again. she will feel ready to take her test again  when they came back. this shows adapting to and accepting her new life away from her home and her memories. the last paragraph proves that she was strong enough to move past her hardships and move on
1 the author finished the story with,  when they come back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melts and the geese return and this hibiscus budding, then i will take that test again.  the reason for conclusion is that it is important for saeng  to feel at home. when the hibiscus buds it wiil remind her of home and this will comfort her, when she feels at peace and at home she will do better on the test.
3 the author of the story  winter hibiscus  most likely concludes it with the paragraph of saeng vowing to retake the test to show that even in difficult times and new situations a person can never give up and sink into despair and that there always things to comfort someone.in the story, glimpses of @caps home are given in her memories and from them, the reader can understand what a difficult day saeng is having. the author is describing these warm, comforting memories to help clash with the cold, bitter day the girl is having.  she closed her eyes and breathed in, deeply. the familiar fragrance filled her lungs.  here, saeng recalls a memory of her grandmother and it saddens her at the thought of her home and her loss. the author builds up saeng s despair and upset for the final paragraph. the author has this as the final paragraph because it shows hope. as saeng says,  then i will take that test again. you can feel her hope. also, the author want s to express how there is still structure and stability in a changing world and that you can look to the simple things. saeng says, the geese return and this hibiscus is budding,  and this shows how there are some reliable things that can give you security when you think you have none. the author uses this last paragraph to balance the feeling of despair in the story, to emphasize the need for hope and to show that there always things that can give you hope and security.
3 in the story the winter hibiscus by minfong ho it explains the obstacles saeng went through coming to a different country. in this story saeng had just failed her driving test as she was reminded of her home through some tropical flowers. moreover the author writes at the end of the story referring to geese  when they come back, saeng vowed silently to herself, it the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and the hibiscus budding, then i will take the test again.  this part of the story is very important because it examines her growth and hope for change, just us the geese will come back and the hibiscus will change into a buetiful blossed flower. furthermore it explains to the each that she will not give up and that she will change to the environment just as th plant lives has and the geese come back to the changed environment. that part of the story is very important for the reader, @caps it concludes saeng thoughts and hopes for the future wile adapting to her new enviorment.     
1 the author concludes the story with this paragraph because saeng said she failed the test, and when spring comes back then she will take the test again. the last paragraph reads  when they come back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then i will take the test again.  she really does not tell us what test she is supposed to be taking.
1 the author ended the story with an unconcluded ending. what i mean is the author wrote so that he could keep readers interested so that they would want to read his other books. also, with an ending of that sort it kind of leaves room for improving and room for a sequal.
1 the author concludes the story with this paragraph because he s saying that once winter and spring s over and the hibiscus is budding, then i ll start over again and try again. the author is saying saeng can t wait till spring so she can plant her own little garden. this is why i think the author concludes the story with this paragraph.
2 the reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph because when she come back from taking driver's test on the way home she saw winter hibiscus that was so beautiful. then she went to the store and buy that flowers and it cost a lot of money when she got home and her mom planting vejetable and her mom ark her what is that so she tell th truth and her know that the flower costs a lot of money she get mad with the dheredulously of her how can she do that - saeng take a big decision that she going to that eventhough her mom mad she she love that flowers i guess because it remaind of in vietnam. the author put this paragraph i think because that the geese return and the flowers is growth she will take the test again bease that when she buy is no flowers came out yet so when it came out she will go again just to let her know that you see the first time and waite when it growth than you can take the test again in my onpion that is a good ending and also it a good question too.
2 in the conclusion of the  winter hibiscus  saeng notes how she will retake  her driving test in the spring when the snow melt sand the geese return.the spring is when these events occur along with the annual budding  of the  winter  hibiscus. her family had moved from vietnam to @location, and she had bought a winter hibiscus  plant  to remind  her of  her  childhood. when it blooms, she  will retake her driving test because the body will bring her the hope of a new beginning in her life, and as a citizen in @location.
0 why did the author concludes the story with this paragraph. is so he can right another story budding on vowed silently and he will right the. story in the spring when they come back
1 i think the author concludes the story with this paraghragh because when she told her mom she failed her test she was crying, but i think it was deeper than that. i think she missed home so much that she couldn't concentrate. she had to cry about something because she didn't want to let her mom know that she misses home.
0 in the story  winter @caps  the author was trying to saying that saeng was from somewhere then where he is now. in the text it say s  it was like walking into another world so he is there thinking like no boby know him except for him and him only.
3 the author of  winter hibiscus  decided to end the story with this paragraph because its like a new beginning for saeng. in saeng moves and fails the test .the winter hibiscus comforts her from the memories of where she used to live. it gives her hope and in the winter it wouldn t be as nice as it would be in the spring. spring is also time for new beginnings because in the winter everything dies and comes back to life in spring .saeng feels she would take the test as a new beginning. from my personal experience i always do spring cleaning because i want to begin fresh. spring is also filled with fresh air and gives me inspiration to do good. this could be why saeng wants to take the test in the spring time. therefore the author of  winter hibiscus  decided to end the story with that paragraph because they wanted to show how saeng wanted a new beginning.  
1 why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is pretty much to say in the spring when the plant starts over saeng will start over to. the story shows that this is the meaning because saeng was having a really hard winter and was having a hard time adjusting to all of the new things, but in the spring she can start over just like the hibiscus will.
2 the author concludes the story with that paragraph because the author is showing how she feels more comfortable with her old home. the winter hibiscus is related to her new home but when winter is gone and new hibiscus came they relate to her new home. the hibiscus from her old home give her a sense of comfort. so when she feels that comfort again she will be brave and go take the test. the author ended the story with that paragraph because it shows that saeng still doesn t like the change and would like to go back to her old home
1 the author concludes that failing the test is not the worst thing. she relizes that times change and you can always get another chance, which is explaned in the last paragh that once the hibiscus buds she will take the test again.
0 the author ends the story with this paragraph because he wants to get the point out that the character dosnt want to rush into things she wants to  do right and not take the quick way out.  
0 the author ends this story with this paragraph because she is explaining her thoughts and why she is taking that test. she is explaining that next year she will find out if it feels like home to her.
1 the author included this because she felt that since saeng failed the test that maybe she should be given a second chance because she tried so hard before. when saeng says  nothing else. i paid over nineteen dollars for it.  it made her mom upset because she used alot of money for one plant just so she could feel at home again since she had one when she was at her old home. eventually her mom say,  it s a beautiful plant  to make her feel better because she feels bad for how she acted towards her daughter. after all the things saeng had to go through is the reason the author added the the last passage into the story.
3 the author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that saeng will perservere through the winter and try to adapt to her new lifestyle. moving to a new country / culture is extremely tough, and saeng is bad, but she doesn t  give up on creating a new life in @location. the concluding sentence,  in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then i will take that test,  is one of determination and hope. the entire story saeng was struggling with adapting to her non of  and memory of her homeland give has a sense of security. the sentence wraps up her emotion and shows how strong she is @caps  could easily give up on their driving test, but she won t. it is a happy ending for somewhat of a sad story. furthering the sentence shows saeng s dwoton  the her plant. this hibiscus will survive and so will saeng when the hibiscus blooms in the spring, so will saeng. she will try as hard she can to fit in and enjoy her new life. that plant will help her through it by reminding her of vietnam us will as giving her a companion throughout the winter. the  author would not have chosen a better  conclusion for this story. the conclusion orggos  to a new hope to perservere  and sucede. as a result, the reader is test with a sense of pleasure and a good feeling torwards the story. this conclusion show how saeng is adapting to changes info and hope to enjoy her  new life in @location.
2 the story was about a girl walking home after failing her driving test and breaking down about her  home  where she no longer lived. after she had broke down, bought the plant, and learned to actually accept the fact that she no longer lived in vietnam and accepting that she had failed her driving test, she realized that she just has to learn to like it. she also learned that her time will come and she will one day be driving. the reason why the auethor concluded the story with this paragraph is because this is the conclusion of the story. this is where one realizes the important things.
2 in  winter hibiscus,  minfong ho ends the story how she does to show a sign of hope. saeng is going to start over when the world starts over. spring is the time when animals come out of their winter holes, when trees blossom, and when the snow melts. it is a time of renewed. saeng  vowed silently to herself to try again in the spring time.saeng parchases the hibiscus in remembrance of her homeland, but also to know when it is ready to come back out of the base to try again. the hibiscus does these actions by coming out of its buds and blooming. ho ends her story in hope of a new beginning. saeng vows,  then i will take that test again.  in the word choice of  that test again  depicts her new attitude. she wants to try again, her test.      
3 the purpose for the ending the author @caps is to show how the hibiscus gives saeng a good sense of comfort, compared to how:- she was at the beginning of the story. it was like she had very little confidence. and now she is forced to call this strange place home, and that emptied her @caps to strive until she see s a very familiar face that brings back her memories of when she was the happiest. having something around that was special to her around all the time can make @caps feel at home or like it use to be, she found her confort in the hibiscus. so now that it rests in her garden to constantly grow through all the seasons, she will to with that reminder of her old home and how good it felt, except now with new memories.
2 the author concludes the story with this paragraph for a couple of different reasons. the author wants to show with meaning, that the budding of the hibiscus plant will be symbolic. ho states,  instead, she stared at the hibiscus plant and nervously tore off a leaf, shredding it to bits,  this shows meaning because it is currently a point in time where saeng has to overcome negative circumstances, and with the plant dead it shows symbolically the meaning of the plant. at another point in the story, saeng realizes that there is much more meaning to the seasons, ho states,  through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now,  she is realizing that come spring time when the plant will be healthy and budding, she will be able to succeed and become somehow like a new person.
1 i think that in the story  winter hibiscus  was a good story and also the author added the paragraph at the end because the main idea was like to work hard and that is why it mentions at the way end  i will take the test again  so you don t fall and stay down you work hard and get back up and try again.
2 in the story  winter hibiscus,  the story ends with that phrase to show that saeng has goals. first, she wants to adapt to the new this new land. this is because she says that when they come back in the spring, which means she wont give up and try to adapt to her new life. this also says she has precision, she will continue to try to get her license because she says,  when they come back in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then i will take that test again.  she says that she will try again. also, it exploits that she will get the courage to keep on trying and not give up.
2 the author included that concluding paragraph because the hibiscus shows saeng  comfort in her time of discomfort.  she would possibly feel more comfortable when the hibiscus is budding because she misses her homeland and the hibiscus reminds her of that she fail test the first time because she was comfortable with being in a new place. but when spring comes, she ll be more confident and comfortable because the hibiscus is budding.
0 the author concudes this story with paragraph because she loves her garden. she concudes it because the story is about then and their garden and it eventually turns cold leaving them nothing to do untill spring. itsuggest they have strong feelings for what they do as it says  in in spring when the snow nelts and the gese return and this hibiscus budding  hears she wants to take the tst to overcome and prove she can take care of her garden.
0 the author concludes the story with this paragraph because she wants to show how some some people vowed silently because the don t want to express themselves. also maybe because they are not very mistful of people even themself. one day i was  like that i didn t want to talk to anybody. all i want to do is sit in my room and think. think about my life were i am going to go after i die. i just woulnd sit in my room in the dark wondering if in my room in the dark wondering if i  would come back in another body or will my soul roam the earth. but think i starting think that i am a kid, i got a wonderful like a head of me. i when i get to the one where i need to think about then i would . so  i started talking to everybody again
0 the reason why is so you get the feeling that saeng feels about gardening. she is praying for spring to come so she can do it over again. she like to watch plants grow and become something that you can eat. that is way the author concluded the story with this paragraph.
1 the author concludes the story with that paragraph because he basicly trying to say that everything happens for a reason, and that reason might mean through seasons. she @month think that she would have better on her test in the spring only for the simply fact that everything blooms in the spring.
1  when they come back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in th spring. when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then i will take that test again.  i think the author concludes the story with the paragraph is that what happens to his life that he will take the test again. but in the story it talks about. one of the blossoms had fallen off, and carefully saeng picked it up and smelled it so i think that they take care of there garden and try to make it live in the winter. so thats what i think about the last paragraph  when they come back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring. when the snows melt and the geese return and his hibiscus is budding, then i will take that test again. 
1 the author concludes the story with this paragraph  when they come back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then i will take that test again.  the author shows that saeng will take the test again and that she will be ready and she will pass the test. also, the author concludes the story with that paragraph because it shows that it ends the story knowing that she will take the test over again, so she knows she has faith to take the test again and make her mother proud that she passed. this is why the author concludes the story with this paragraph
1 i think that the author concludes the story with this paragraph because he things when the flowers come back they would be batter. i think the he thinks that it would be a better test next time
1 i think the author finish the story of with that @caps the girls see s this plant as a symbol of straidth and faith so she will take the test next year when it comes back @caps she truly likes the plant and she hopes it will bring her lack.
2 the author concludes the story with the paragraph that she did because it was the end and the start of a new beggining. the author uses the sensens in her story. the winter is the current season and spring is on its way. although saeng failed her test in the winter when most things die, she is looking forward to spring to start again on her test. the geese will return and the hibiscus will bud to show spring is here with new life. saeng will also have new life in her test to pass it this time and drive. the spring season will come and new life will be provided to all.   
2 the author concludes with that statement because it shows she needs time. she needs time to adjust to her new home like the hibiscus to get some roots in the new soil she is on. when she is at the orchard she sees the hibiscus and has memories of her old home making her cry but yet feel good at the same time.
2 in the story winter hibiscus written by @caps ho. the narrarator goes to a greenhouse that has many flowers but one in perticular catches her eye. a ''winter'' hibiscus plant. this plant reminds her of her homeland and everything that used to take place there this plant also reminds her of  her grandmother's long silkly gray hair and how she used to watch her dry it in the sun and then she would help her knot it up into a ton with a bud of this plant in it. the author ends the story with this because it counters her statement when she say  i-i failed the test.  and the end of this passage  says   ..., then i will take the test again .
1 the author of winter hibiscus ended her story with words regarding to the story @caps failed her driving test. saeng cried when noticing her past through flower. as well as bought dok malik seeds show that the story ended the way it did, because next season
1  the author concludes the story with this paragraphto show that saeng is determined. she says that she is going to take the test again which shows that she is determined. even though saeng failed her driverd test she is not going to give up.
2 i believe that this was a good ending to the story. when saeng says  when they come back  she is talking about the flowers. when the come back alive.  in the spring  shows when the flower will come back.  when the snows melt and the geese return  she is saying that after winter (when the snows melts) and when the geese return(in spring).  and this hibiscus is budding  she is saying when the flowers blume again in the spring.   then i will take the test again,  she is saying after all this happens she will retake the test (in the spring). this shows that saeng will be watching at all these things happening and count down till spring again, so she can retake the test. she is ready for spring to be here, so that she can study and pass the test, and work at the flower @caps. this will be her goal for the winter, till spring comes!
1 the author ends the story like that to show the theme working hard, some other examples of working hard are the  winter hibiscus.  another example is her vow to pass the test, so that is why the author ends the story that way.
2 the author concludes the story with that paragraph, because it shows saeng will not give up. saeng failed her drivers test and as she was walking home she found a hibiscus. it reminder her of her old home. saeng goes to the green house or flowershop and buys one. when she returns she plants the hibiscus. the hibiscus is keeping her from giving up. when it starts budding, @person will take the test again.
3 the author concludes the story with the paragraph  when they come back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then i will take that test again,  for several reasons, @caps, saeng decides that she is determined to pass her driving test just like the hibiscus. saeng s mother says that it is  strong enough to make it through,  and saeng decides to be strong like the hibiscus and make it through and pass the test. next, the reason the geese are mentioned in the final paragraph is to tie in the fact that she is getting used to @location because the geese  sound familiar.  as much as she misses her old home, she is adapting. finally, one can conclude that because she mentions the plant, which symbolizes her homeland and the geese, which symbolizes her new home, that as much as she misses her old home, she s starting to get used to her new country and she recognizes that she ispart of it. she knows that letting her past get in the way of her will not help her pass the test and, like the plant and the geese, she will return again.
1 i think the author ended the story like that because she enjoys to see the geese and she loves the spring and wants to take the test and pass. sh is studying for it in the mean time.
1 the reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because the author feels that saeng will pass the test if she has the hibiscus with her, she thinks that because the hibiscus has something unique about it. and as also gives her memory of where she used to live before she had moved to the @organization. saeng had seemed out of place she did not know what to do.
1 they ended it because the girl is not going to give up. she is going to keep trying at this test and wont stop at it eaither. and she will be alittle brighter. she will also pass this test. and this way she wont disappoint her mother. and she will be able to get this test of of her sholders.
2 the author concludes with that because she kind of relates herself to the flowers. she has grown to her environment like a flower. also she had failed her test, so just like when a flower dies and then comes back, she is going to come back and try the test again.
2 the author concludes the story with the sentence saying  when they come back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then i will take the test again  because the hibiscus is not as a good luck charm, when it s not there things aint right but when it comes back thing s then out for the better. also the author concludes this because the good luck charm the hibiscus gave more confidence and when say it real confident one will succeed. last one not story this let s the reader know that she believes in something that gives her hope and that will make her so well
2 saeng is trying to say that when the time comes again that she will take the test. the author concludes the story with this because it leaves you wondering about what will happen the next time she takes the test. the auther also does this to show that you should never quit like if the flower can survive winter then she will be able to survive that test. also the author is saying that when the seasons change, things change. she was going to give up because she failed the test but she seen that plant surviving through the harsh weathers and that gave her more confidence. also she cherished the plant because she wants to see it budding because her and her mother spent quality time dve to this plant she had.
0 saeng is talking about her school work and the garden. she always connects the two of them in the same way. she knows that she has to study while the garden grows and she wants to water  the flowers and she is saying that when the spring comes she wont be there for the garden and she will have to take the test.
1 the author most likely concludes the story with that paragraph because they are trying to show the reader that even though you fail at something, you can t be stubborn. so saeng failed her drivers test but in the spring when the hibiscus plant starts to bud she will go back and take the test again. by the plant budding she thinks of that as a sign that she will pass the test
2 the story ands with that paragraph because saeng believes next spring when her new hibiscus is born she will have good luck to pass her driving test. it is a good way to end the story because the hibiscus was not involved in her life before she took the drivers test. now she beleives that on her next driving test she will have the connection to her past experiences, ability to overcome obstacles, and comfort in a time of disappointment. which saeng thinks can help her pass the test.
2 the author concludes the story with this because its winter now + the flowers are gone, but during that time when she was planting she grew more mature. like it says in the text things she used to think were strange are now becoming firmiliar + shes getting the hang of things. because shes learning more about it + will be ready for the test next spring. 
1 there are two reasons why he had conclude the story with this pararagraph. the one reason why the author had conclude the story with the paragraph because saeng had silently had picked up a winter hibiscus so she can have to passed that driving test. finally; the last reason why the author had conclude the story with this paragraph because she wants to try her driving test again so she can passed so she can also drive when she gets down passing it. these two reasons were so confusing to figure out what the author conclude in the story with that sentence.
3 i belive that the author concludes the story with that particular paragraph to that she still has hope of finding home and being happy. the hibiscus plant in her mind is a symbol of home and happy memories with her grandmother. so when the plant budds, she will feel like she is at home again and is happy, that is when she will take the driving test. also, that paragraph shows that she is slowly getting acustomed to the new home and lifestyle,  a flock of canada geese flew by, their faint honks deer and yes familiar to saeng now. almost reluctantly she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now, like these geese.  through these examples i believe that the narrator put that last paragraph there, to show saeng assimilation into her new lifestyle, and her acception of her situation.
0 the author concluded the story with that paragraph because that season is over and a new season is starting.
0 they conclude the story with that because the winter is over and spring is here and it will be beautiful again
3 i believe the author concludes the story with this paragraph, because the author wants to express to the reader that saeng has been comforted by the hibiscus and is willing to give the test another try. she is now more open  minded about the situation. in the beginning of the story, saeng was upset and annoyed about failing her driver s test. for example,  the tearstains on her daughter s cheeks and her puffy eyes. i-i failed the test,  saeng said to her mother. obviously she was upset and disappointed in herself. the author didn t want to end the story with a sad, unsatisfying ending. saeng changes her attitude about the test by the end of the story. for example,  when they come back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then i will take the test again.  i believe that this attitude was because of the memorys of her mother country that soothes her and also her mother. in conclusion the author ended the story with that to teach the reader a lesson to let change occur and time does heal.
1 the author uses this conclusion for a reason. the reason the author uses this cliff-hanges of a conclusion is to keep the reader interested and wanting more. by saying, i will take that test again,  the author makes the reader question if saeng will pass the test next time and the reader will wonder what  the test  is.
3 the mood in this story was security and happiness. security was prevailed when all different people with different culture and heritage could live together without fights or arguments at a time when there was a lot of racial tension in @location. happiness was showed in many different ways. one way was when he was describing the warmth, music and cooking in his house. also, when he was talking about how thankful he was for what his parents sacrificed for him. overall, @person was happy about how his whole childhood when and it seemed like he loved every last minute of it.
1 the mood created by the author showed me to be happy with what i have and to be grateful for what i am givin. i learned this from all the moods the author expressed in his memoir of his life. as i state this is the mood the author expressed.           abd
3 in this excerpt from  home: the blueprints of our lives,  by narciso rodriguez, the author sets a very clear mood in the memoir. narciso rodriguez's  eternally grateful for his family and everything they did for him. for example,   narciso rodriguez  will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. i've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing then i could have ever done.  @caps admires  their strength and perseverance, and i've thanked them repeatedly.  @person feels that  there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are.  @person  learned the real definition of 'family.'  @person  will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home. 
2 the mood  displayed by the author was a warm cozy feeling that felt like home. it showed his small house and family and their interests and how they all acted together. it really showed what he called home and what he called a family. the memoir explained the food he ate and the music he heared all through out his childhood and how he grew up.
2 the mood the author created in the memoir is a roller coaster. it goes up and down. at the beginning of this story, it was quit deppressing. it's basically just rodriguez describing the crummy quarters he lived in. but, as the story progresses, it is filled with happiness and even though living conditions werent all that great, he still had fun. in the end, home is about relationships rather than physical space.
1 i think the mood is happy. because spanish cuban and italian in the same neigh borhood with out fighting, and it seems like they like than life in united states.
2 i think the mood in this story was sad/happy. i think it was happy because it says he loved to cook  and he thanked his parents for teaching him to cook.  also in paragraph @num its a paragraph dedicated to his parents. i think it is sad because in paragraph @num it says his parents had very good jobs but when they came to the united states they had to startover.
2 i think that the author created a very warming, and the loving tone. narciso created this mood by including all of the greatest aspects of his home in @location. for example, in paragraph @num he explains the endless celebrations he had with family and friends that  ... formed the backdrop to life in our warm home. 
4 the way the author describes his family and his home gives the memoir a very warm, happy, and pleasant mood. he had a very warm tone when he talks about how much love there was in his house.  here, the innocence of childhood, and the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home.  the mood of the memoir was happy up lifting when he talked about how his parents helped others and they always had people in their house.  my parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us.  the mood of the memoir was brought to life when the author described the rich culture in his home.  traditional cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen.... unwittingly passed on to me they're rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which i am eternally grateful). passionate cuban music (which i adored to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen.  i think the addition in the parentheses make it light and airy. his tone is thrilled and thankful for his rich culture. the author's tone was very sweet, i think, when thanking his parents.  but, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me... and the demonstration of how important family and friends are.... and these teachings have been the basis of my life.  the mood of the memoir is warm, happy, and sweet, thanks to the author.
4 the mood the author created in the memoir is united, caring, loving and more. the authour is combining all of those moods together and memories to write this memoir, which is what a memoir is about; yourself, memories, family and etc. a reason why the author created does moods because a home is were a family live's together and were they hold memories together which shows loving. for example in the memoir,  here the innocence of childhood, the congregation of a family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home.  which is obviously the mood of loving, because there all a loving family together. a second reason why the author created does mood because in the place were the author lived there were many different people from different places. even though they all werent the same the acted as a family and were united. for example,  in our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship.  which means that even though there different there going to be there for one another which is united. a third reason why the author created does moods because the author's parent's werent just caring for themselves but for others also just like their children. for example,  they come selflessly, as many immagrants do, to give their children a better life.  which means her parent werent just caring abalt them but the future for there son. the whole story is based on home and family but the thing is that a home and family will always share the love, caring and unity of one another.
4 the mood created in  narciso rodriguez  is grateful and happy. first, @caps is very grateful because @caps says  ...to give their children a better life  his parents gave up what they were doing in their homeland cuba to come live in @location to make a better life for their child to start off and live in. @caps recognizes this but, @caps also knows @caps can never do enough to thank them. next, it says  family has nothing to do with love relatives.  @caps is very grateful and thankful that @caps grew up in the neighborhood @caps did where everyone was treated like brothers and sisters and they all felt saf in their community that they created. also the story says  i've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing that i could have ever done.  @caps knows that it took a lot of heart to do that much for someone else when all it did for his parents was make their lif tougher. they had to start over and that is what made him most grateful for his parents. that is what i truly think the mood of the story is.
2 the mood in this memoir is happy and joyful. this child that is telling the story is telling about the happy things in their life. they tell about how they were born into a simple house. the heart of their home is the kitchen because they all love to cook. the family invites many people over to their home to have dinner. this child also talks about how greatful they are for their parents, and how the thanked them repeatedly. they will never forget how their parents turened their simple house into a home. so by these examples you can see that the mood of the memoir is happy and joyful.
3 in this memoir there are many different moods that the auther tells you about. happiness is a mood that the author tells you about. they are all happy because they can be together and have a grate time. another mood is careing. her parents care about others and keep there doors open for them at all times. love. love is all around this house. they love all their friends and family and celebrate with then no matter what. they also show there love by leting people stay with them untill they can get back up onto there feet. one mood in this memoir is courage, these two people show courage when they get here and they keep that courage for a very long time. expeshaly when they come from having such grate jobs to ones that arnt that great.
2 the mood created by the author in the memoir was happy. it made me feel happy because it was good to know that  'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative. this meant that all the people around you that care about you are your  family . another reason why the mood of the memoir is happy is because i think if my parents were in the same situation that narciso's parents were in, my parents would have done the same thing. my parents would have also wanted,  to give their children a better life.  @caps this memoir makes me feel happy because of how caring narciso's parent's were.
2 the mood created by the @caps in the memoir is happy. i think there is hapiness because of what it says on paragraph @num.  in our neighborhood, despite the customs elsewhere, all of these culture came together in a great solidarity and friendship.  @caps that mean that there were a happy and friendly family. in conclusion, that's the mood i think the @caps created and some reasons why.
1 the mood created by the @caps is happy because he talking about starting a new life and how grateful family he has. the way he is also happy is that he has his 'family such as cousin, aunts, uncles, and grandparents by his side. where he live is also happy he loves it he has his friends and babysitter living above him knowing that they are their for him. that why i think the mood is happy by telling by the story and @caps words.
3 in this memoir author creates a very specific mood that is the same throughout the memoir. the mood of this memoir was a comforting and happy mood. one way that this mood was @caps was that they talked how their enviorment showed a great sense of family and when i think of family i see the mood as comforting and happy.  growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that family had nothing to do with being a blood relative . this showed the mood because his family always took in people and made them feel welcomed @caps reason the mood was comforting and happy was that it talked about how all of the people were nice and kind to everyone they met.  it was a close nit community of honest hardworking immigrants who extend a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need . this is how the memoir showed a happy and comforting mood.
3 narciso rodriguez creates a truely original mood in the excerpt. i would say he puts a kind of grateful mood in the excerpt. he is consteintly stating how grateful he is toward his parents for their selflessness, and courage. one example of narciso creating a grateful mood is when he says:  i will always be grateful for their love and sacrifice. i've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing and i could have ever done.  this quote shows how much gratitude narciso actually has for his parents. another example where narciso shows tremendous gratitude is when he says:  they came, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they love.  in this quotation, rodriguez shows that he knows what it took to come here, he knows the loses that his parents went through, and for that he is truely grateful.
3 people make sacrafices for the ones they love. that is called being selfless. in the story, narciso's parents are selfless. they left their family and friends to give their son a better life. the author makes an enjoyable and heartwarming mood.narciso is very greatful. he said he has  learned the definition of 'family'  . his parents wanted a better life for him. they gave up a lot and he recognize that. rodriguez realized his parents were very hardworking. he respected his parents and loved them for everything they have done for him.  i often tell them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than i could have ever done.  it's a great feeling knowing someone will do anything for you.family is very important. @person mentioned how his neighbors were all immagrants. they had left their family, too; and only had eachother. knowing you have people who are like family is incredible. although they can never replace blood relatives, friends are the next best thing. i think growing up, @person learned to very important lessons. put others before yourself, and work hard.
1 the mood in the memoir is calm and thankful. the calmness is because there are no conflicts. the thankful part is he keeps thanking his parents for making the sacrifice. how they did it for the next generations. the mood in this memoir calm and thank ful
2 the memoir narciso rodriguez from the blue prints of our lives, there is a mood. the mood is very happy and positive and friends and family like, for example they just moved from cuba away from family just for his better life. also it very helping and sellflly becuse even though ther friends and family were in cuba to parnts moved to new jersey for a new lif for the kide and make a home. this is the mood of the memoir narciso rodriguez.
3 the mood  in the memoir could be many things the one that really stands out to me though is grateful. one way how @caps shows this is @caps says  i will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice @caps is so thankful that her parents brought her to @location so @caps could live a wonderful life.another way @caps shows @caps is grateful is @caps says  i will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home.  @caps respects what her gone through to make her life enjoyable and not like what her parents lives were.the last way @caps shows gratefulness is @caps thanks her parents every day for what they have done.  i've thanked them repeatedly  @caps says in paragraph @num. i don't think @caps could ever picture what her life would be like if her parents didn't do that for her. this is what i think the mood is in the memoir.

3 in my opinion the mood is created by the auther in the memoir by the setting and describing her child hood, where she was born and why her parents came here. the reason i think this is because the mood can create this setting, because the mood is the feeling in the story, such as sad, happy, lonely, silent and that is what creates the setting which is where, when, and time of the story. some examples from the excerpt are,  in @number i was born into this simple house, situated in a two-family building, in the ironbound section of newark, new jersey.  also,  growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that  family  had nothing to do with being blood relative.  the author is very thankful for her cuban heritage and her home is about relationship then just space. in this memoir the mood created the setting.
4 i particularly enjoyed this memoir. the author did a fantastic job at creating a sense of love and comfort while telling his story. the first sentence that stuck out to me was in paragraph @num:  passionate  cuban music (which i adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen.  to me, that sentence was all about making people feel comfortable and at home. it put out a sense of family in the story. the feeling of love was easily put into the story at paragraph @num, when the author talked about his family. especially where the author had said  my parents  always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us. the family loved everybody, and used their love to help struggling people, or people who just wanted to visit, get back on their feet and stay in their home. this story was truly filled with dozens of examples of love and comfort, and i really enjoyed reading it.
4 in the memoir narciso rodriguez by narciso rodriguez, the author shows a very strong mood relating to the piece. the emotions used to create the mood include passion, unity, and gratitude.the mood of this memoir has lots of passion. narciso talks about his family's passion for their cuban heritage, and how they shared it with him. that was a big component of turning that house into a home, and therefore, part of the mood that rodriguez wanted to represent.  ... my young parents created our traditional cuban home... love of cooking... passionate cuban music...  (rodriguez, @num). i also could feel a sense of unity the author was trying to portray.  .. the congregation of family and friends...  the author mentions several times his parents and him were always letting distant relatives stay at the house, and many friends and family came and shared dinner with them. the author even describes his community as a  ... a close-knit community...  (rodriguez, @num). lastly, a sense of gratitude runs along the spine of this piece. the author notes his parents were a huge part of his life, exposing his to his culture, family and friends, and they home. he doesn't even have to write how grateful he is, it is so evident.  i will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.

3 the author of the memoir is thankful of her parents and to the rest of her family. i know the author is thankful for his parents because in paragraph @num, the author says,  they came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, freinds, and careers in the country they loved.  @caps reason why i think she is thankful for her parents is because they made their lifes worse to make the authors life better. i know this because in paragraph @num, it says,  in the united states, they had to start their lives over entirely, taking whatever they could find.  the last reason why i know is because he basicly says it in the last sentence of paragraph @num. it says,  i will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home. that is the authors mood in this memoir.

4 while reading the memoir titled  narciso rodriguez  from home: the blueprints of our lives by narciso rodriguez. i could feel the great sense of mood and emotion that the author poured into it. to describe the mood he created in this memoir, i would have to describe it as a great sense of love and gratitude for some things called home and family. this memoir is just gushing appreciation for family, parents, love, courage, and a caring home everywhere you look.rodriguez starts off by describing his cuban heritage and how it was always there during his childhood. in paragraph @num it states,  my parents... passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which i am eternally grateful). passionate cuban music (which i adored to this day) filled the air... . here you can really feel he appreciated how his parents incorporated his heritage into his daily life as a child and how he still has fond memories of those times. rodriguez than goes on to discuss in paragraphs @num and @num the community he had grown up in and what he learned from being part of such a tight knit neighborhood, such as to open up your heart and home to those in need and to never hesitate when the people you care about need help. this is shown in para @num, in two instances when he says,  growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that  family  had nothing to do with being a blood relative.  and where it also says,  in our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all these cultures came together and great solidarity and friendship. at the end of his memoir, rodriguez then goes on to describe the love and appreciation he has for his parents for having  such courage  and how  they came selflessly  (para, @num) to @location. in para @num it tells,  i will always be grateful for their love and sacrifice.  rodriguez really tells of how their faithfulness and great examples have also helped shape him into the man he is today.to conclude, i truly need to say is that rodriguez did a marvelous job with giving his memoir a very generous dosage of mood. it spoke volumes of how indebted he feels to his parents for giving him a loving home and teaching him how much family means, which i believe is the best gift a parent can give their child.
4 in the memoir, by narciso rodriguez the mood created by the author is togetherness. there are many other words to describe the mood, but togetherness describes the family as a whole. the parents accepted almost anybody into their home and they were very welcoming. to illustrate this, it says in the memoir,  my parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us.  @caps could also describe the mood because the rodriguez family let their neighbors and family to their table and they were very friendly. in the memoir it states,  my aunts bertha and juanita and my cousins arnold, maria, and rosemary also lived nearby and regularly joined us at our table.  that quote also shows togetherness within the family. that the rodriguez family stayed together through all the hard times of moving countries, getting new jobs, and starting over was really an accomplishment, especially in @location. the memoir shows that,  ... my parents both had to accept that they might not be able to find the kind of jobs they deserved.  @caps, the family created the mood of togetherness, especially going through hard times.

4 the mood in the memoir  narciso rodriguez  by narciso rodriguez, is comfort. in chapter @num it talks about the overall feelings of love and care that surrounded the rodriguez household like a comfy blanket. also, it talks about how the  ... congregration of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompass both...  helped pave the road for a great childhood with many friends and family members who where always there for narciso rodriguez to rely on. another example of the comfort within the rodriguez home is that the  ... parents always kept their arms and door open to many of the people... considered family, knowing that they would do the same...  this portrays an overall image of a community where everyone got along and helped each other out. last but not least narciso's home was  ...always filled... (with) life and love.  where he felt secure and cared for. all in all, the household that @person lived in was a household filled with love, care and especially comfort that every child should have.
2 the mood created by the author in this... memoir would be thankfulness and appreciation. i think @person, wrote this memoir for his parents. he wanted to portrey that even though most people would think that he had a tough life, he would completely disagree. he reailzes that his parents did what they did so @person would have a better life. he appreciated the fact that his parents always made anyone feel like they were part of the family. they were loving, caring, heartwarming people. like @person said,  i will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home.
3 throughout this memoir the mood was very realistic. while i was reading it i was very interested in what narciso had to say next. it seemed as if he was extremely happy to be at where he's @caps. from his speech in this story i can tell that his personality is very outgoing and he likes to look back at where he used to be, and where he is now, and all the sacrifices that have been made throughout his lifetime. he is a very grateful child. another mood in the story was happiness, along with unity. naciso quotes  i will always be grateful to my parents for their love & sacrifice. i've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than i could have ever done.  just by reading this quote you can clearly see that narciso is very grateful. he also quotes  but, in reality there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important my friends and family are to me.  @caps reader, there you have it. those are the two main quotes throughout this memoir explaining the mood of the set!

(@caps in the beginning paragraph @num) that quote sets a mood where a little audience in your head goes  @caps i never thought of that way before.  this memoir does not give out blunt moobs like happy or sad, it makes you think. there was never a really sad moment in the whole thing. at the end of paragraph @num he says  i will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home.  this quote is another example of giving a very undefind mood, i say it is undefind because you just cant put it into words of how you feel. so in conclusion the mood this piece gives is undefind.

4 the mood of this memoir is the importance of family. @organization says in the beginning how much he loves his cuban culture and heritage. for example,  my parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me there rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which i am eternally grateful). passionate cuban music (which i adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen.  narciso rodriguez enjoyed his ethnicity very much. him and his family were always very open and welcoming to other people.  my parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us.   narciso also became close to other immigrants that were not blood-related to him.  growing up in this envirement instilled me a great sense that  family  had nothing to do with being a blood relative. quite the contrary, our neighberhood was made up of mostly spanish, cuban, and italian immigrants.  narciso was close to many people who he considered family.

4 in the excerpt  narciso rodriguez , by narciso rodriguez, there are several ways in which the author created the mood. for instance, when the author states how his family is from cuba and they were able to move to a modest apartment.. the authors states,    originally from cuba  could afford to move into a modest  apartment i would soon call home  (@num). this quote shows, that the authors parents wanted to give him a good life. they did this by moving themselves and him to @location. another example occurs when, the author describes what his kitchen  heart of the house is like and how even though they are new jersey, their house still feels like cuba. the author says,  passionate cuban music (which i adore) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen  (@num). this quote demonstrates, that the authors family made sure he still knew what cuba is like. the authors parents wanted to show him both sides of the world (cuba and @location). last, when the author says how grateful he is about his parents and the way he grew up. the author says,    i learned the real definition of  family   i learned there how to love  (@num). this quote shows, that the author has learned all the important skills in life. thanks to his family he now knows how to love and treat everyone with respect. clearly, there are many ways the author created the mood for the excerpt.
4 in 'narciso rodriguez,' the author creates mood in several ways. the mood created by the author is a warm, happy mood that associates with feelings of family and love. the first place we can see this mood is in paragraph four where the narrator tells us  my parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us.  this shows that everyone in their community loved each other and help each other, which added to the mood of family and love. the narrator also tells us of his parents that  they came selflessly, as most immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they love.  this shows that the narrator's parents loved him so much that they wanted the absolute best for him no matter where it took them. this shows they feel family is very important to them adding to the mood of family created by the author. the final place this mood can be seen is when the narrator tells us that he would  always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice,  and that it was from his parents that he  learned the real definition of family.  this shows how much he loved and respected his parents which added to the warm, loving mood. in 'narciso rodriguez' several things used by the author create a warm mood of family and love.

4 in the memoir, narciso rodriguez, the author creates a mood of appreciation + happiness. @caps does this by starting w/ background, + by the end moving to the lessons @caps learned from his parents.first, @caps describes how wounderful this enviornment was in paragraph @num.  my young parents created a traditional cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen... my parents passed on to me... a love of cooking that is still with me today (for which i am eternally grateful). passionate cuban music (which i adore to this day) filled the air...  @caps continues by describing how wonderful a place to grow up it was + how his parents showed him genorosity.next, @caps says how hard it was for his parents to leave everything they knew, just for their children. in states in paragraph @num,  they came selflessly... to give their children a better life.  @caps continues by writing of how strong they were by showing him the value of family + friends + genorosity. this shows how apprecitive @caps was of them. overall, by communicating this mood, @caps was able to honor his parents that much more.
1 i think the @caps was happy. i think he was because he has a nice house and a nice family. another reason why i think he was happy is because he is now in @location but still around his cuban culture. his parents put him in @location i think because they wanted to live there and start a family. that is why i think that this is the mood of the @caps in this memoir.
2 the mood created in the memoir,  narciso rodriguez  made me feel like i was in their kitchen eating cuban food, and listen to music. also, he told the life of a cuban immigrant. my grandfather followed the same path. he was a young boy when his family immigrated from cuba. but he worked his hardest and became a very succesful man. this story completely reminds me of him and since i have some background with this, i know this  mood  and it speaks to me. the memoir really shows,  the @caps @caps.  a person coming here with close to nothing and become a very succesful person. finally, the mood he created shows that if you put your mind too it you could accomplish anything. also, it shows the mood created in a typical cuban home.
2 the mood created by the author in this memoir is being thankful. narciso rodriguez is thankful for his parents giving him a loving home in @location. the author created a mood that the reader should be thankful for their parents. the sacrifice and love of anyones parents (like rodriguez's) is what you should be most thankful for.

3 in the memoir narciso rodriguez from home: the blueprints of our lives the author sets a sad mood in this memoir. an example of the sad mood set the author describes his neighborhood. the author describes his neighbor hood by saying  our neighborhood was made up of mostly spanish, cuban and italian immigrants.  (@num) this show they live in a run down neighborhood because most immigrants are poor when they arrived at the @location @caps example is when he describes his family. the author say's  there was often someone staying with us temporarly until they were able to get back on their feet . (@num) this shows the poverty that they lived around because they had to put shelter around those who couldn't aford it. the last way the author describes the sacrifice of his parents, the author say's  the faith that this would lead them and their children to better times drove them to endure these hard times . (@num) this is a sad mood because it shows how their @caps back fired and they didn't have a very happy time. that is why i think the tone of this memoir is a sad one.
4 in the story,  narciso rodriguez,  the narrator had shown happiness throughout the memoir.one example of when the author showed happiness was when they were thinking about cooking. they admired when their parents helped and teached them how to cook. they would hear the music in the back that they adored as their heritage or backround. in the story it says,  my parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking. when the authors still live with their parents their relatives would come over to eat and have fun. to reflect back on those memories made the author happy. in the story it says,  countless extended family members came and went-- and there was often someone staying with us temporarily until they were able to get back upon their feet. @caps example is when the author thought of the time when their parents moved to @location. they thought of how lucky their parents were to come to such a nice place. in the story it says,  they came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind families, friends, and careers in the country they loved.
2 warmth                                                                                                                                            in the memoir  narciso rodriguez  the author created the mood in many ways.one way the author creates the mood is by saying (paragraph @num)  the very heart of which was the kitchen; passionat cuban music filled the air. here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations . this creates a warm mood because the kitchen seems like a very friendly place due to the people gathering together.another way the author creates the mood is by saying that  my parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we concidered family, knowing that they would do the same for us . (paragraph @num)these are the ways of the author of  narciso @caps  created the mood in this story.
2 the mood i think the author created in the memoir was love.the reason why i say love is because to me he cares about the his family and he also stayed with his family tradition and he care and follows them. he also loved being with his family. for example in paragraph @num in the article it say;  i will never forget that house or it's gracious neighborhood or the many things i learned there about how to love. i will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home. and to me that shows love thats why i think the author created love as his mood in the memoir.
3 in the excerpt  the mooring mast  by marcia amidon l sted, many complications occurred during the plans and construction of the attempted docking mast. one obstacle was that dirigibles were just too heavy and the metal frame of the building would have to be modified. after repairing the framework of the empire state building, two trial runs were displayed by the @organization dirigible  los angeles  and the goodyear blimp  columbia . the result of the expirament were that the wind current, physically, didn't allow the blimp to come close enough to the building to dock also,  an existing law against airships flying too low over urban cities  was an obstacle they could not surpass. within years of postponing their efforts, airplanes made way and dirigibles, as transportation, were long forgotten.
4 based on the excerpt, the mooring mast by @person, the builders of the empire state building were faced with a number of obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the top. the greatest obstacle the builders faced was nature itself. @person stated,  the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents,  therefore it wasn't safe for dirigibles to be docked there. the wind would cause them to swivel around the mast, and it would be unsafe for the builders to hang lead weights on the dirigibles because they would be dangling above the pedestrians on the street. the other obstacle which prevented dirigibles from mooring at the empire state building was due to the law against airships flying too low over urban areas or cities. this existing law made it illegal for dirigibles to ever tie up to the building or just approach it because the area was too low over the city. @person said,  although two dirigibles did attempt to reach the building before the entire idea was dropped.  @caps two dirigibles failed at getting close enough to tie up or to deliver there cargo safetly, because of the forceful winds and the non-existence of certain mooring equipment, which should've been installed. due to the obstacles, dirigibles were never able to moor at the building.
2 based on excerpt builders of empire state building faced alot of obsticles. here are my three points to consider. they need to make plans that were very difficult and hard. the blimps and @caps could crash in to the building. it was too high firstly. the builders needed to make long difficult, plans. they needed to make the right skeleton for the mast to fit the rest of the building. they had to make changes to the existing plans to fit the mooring mast. secondly, the blimps and @caps could cause an accident. blimps fly about @num miles per hour and they could approach the mast at a speed that is too fast and destroy it. lastly, the mast was very high. it would be hard for blimps to reach the height of the mast. irving clavan said,  ... such a height made it desirable to post poned to a later date for the landing gears.  in @caps builders of the empire state building faced a lot of obsticles. the plans were difficult the blimps and @caps could crash and the mast height was too high.
1 when they build the empire state building they faced obstacles building it. an obstacle they faced was that they wanted to make it as high and as safe as possible. the way the architetures wanted to make it the tallest building in the world was by putting a mooring mast on the top of the building. a mooring mast is basically a dock for dirigibles (blimps). this was dangerous. it was because the mast could snap at such a high altitude and plumate to the ground or snap, and dangle high above the street.  ... the government people in washington are figuring on some way of mooring airships to this mast,  says al smith four year term governor of new york. although it may look nice, its not the safest idea.
4 the builders of the empire state building faced many problems that  should have been apparent before it was ever constructed. one of the problems that they faced was that many dirigibles  used hydrogen rather than, helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable.  this factor caused that the owners of the building to worry about the safety of the many civilians that lived in downtown new york. another factor that the builders face was that the winds  were constantly shifting due to violent air currents.  this caused problems because in landing fields the blimps could be weighted down with lead weights but that could not be done at the empire state building; many dirigibles would not be able to reach the building either due to the winds. one last factor that was faced is that it is against the law to have airships fly to low over the urban areas. this  law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area.  all these factors caused  the idea of using the mooring mast for drigibles and passengers  to disappear.
3 the builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles. in the excerpt said  the mooring mast of the empire state building was destined to fail.  a somehow unseen obstacle was the fact that  most dirigibles from outside the united states used hydrogen instead of helium  which is a much more unstable gas and if a dirigible caught fire and went down over new york many civilians would be killed or wounded. another obstacle the builders faced was  the winds at the top of the building were constantly shifting.  this would make it very difficult to ancor a dirigible down to the mast and as the excerpt said they could not use lead weights hanging from the underside of the dirigible because they would be hanging over citizens below. those are the problems faced by the builders of the empire state building.
3 builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the mooring mast. one of which being that most dirigibles outside the u.s. used hydrogen to float, making them very flammable and unsafe. if a blimp were to be damaged over new york, many people could be hurt. also, nature itself made docking extremely difficult. winds made the blimps very unstable. if one were tied to the mast, winds could wrap the line around the mast. another obstacle was the existing law that prohibited aircrafts from flying that low over urban areas. this made it illegal for any ship to even approach the mast.
3 al smith and his team of builders faced several obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the empire state building. the first problem with docking dirigibles is that the steel frame and foundation could not support the stress put on it by a dirigible attached to it. also, when the builders looked back on past dirigible accidents like the hindenburg, they realized that if an accident were to occur, many lives would be at stake. furthermore, there were laws that limited how low a dirigible could fly over urban areas, so it would be illegal for a dirigible to dock at the empire state building because it would be too low. finally, and according to the builders, most importantly, the largest problem with docking dirigibles to the empire state building was mother nature. winds at the top of the building were very high and changed unpredictably, effectively turning the dirigible docked into a disaster waiting to happen.
3 now, people know what a ludacris idea it was to have dirigibles dock on top of the empire state building; however, in the @date's and @num's people were oblivious to the idea many failures and the obstacles the builders would face. one obstacle that was faced was that most of these dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium, which is extremely flammable and put the city at risk. another obstacle was nature, due to the winds on top of the empire state building it was hard to bring the dirigibles remotely close to the mast. yet another obstacle facing the builders of the mast was a law that prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas like new york city. overall, the idea could not be projected into a real-life, visual interpretation because of the obstacles faced by the builders of the mast, now people have airplanes and airports to dock the planes - theres no use for the mast on top of the empire state building regarding aviation.
3 there are a few obstacles the builders faced when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the empire state building. one was the violently changing wind currents at the height the docking to place. this would move the blimp and possibly send it into another building, puncturing the side of the balloon. dirigible after dirigible being docked would put a lot of stress on the building itself. it would disrupt the frame and possibly effect the building as a whole. also most dirigibles outside the united states used hydrogen rather than helium. hydrogen is highly flamable as seen in the hindenburg disaster. due to all these reasons the mooring mast never saw a docked blimp.
4 the builders of the empire state building faced many difficulties in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. one difficulty they faced was when they were designing the mast. they  could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the empire state building's flat roof...  (  @num) because it  would add stress to the building's frame . (  @num) this was a difficulty because the empire state building's frame had to be modified and strengthened to accommodate it, resulting in @money in modifications. another difficulty faced by the builders was in regards to nature. as dirigibles use  hydrogen instead of helium  (  @num), there was a great risk of fire; always a problem above new york city. the wind was also a problem. the winds on top of the building were  constantly shifting due to violent air currents  (  @num). the back of the ship would have to be weighed down by lead; again, not feasible in new york city. a final difficulty the builders faced were existing air laws. the builders' faced the issue of existing law against airships  flying too low over urban areas.  (  @num) this made it  illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area.  (  @num) some of the many difficulties faced by builders of the empire state building were mast designs, nature and existing air flights laws.
3 in the passage,  the mooring mast  by marcia amidon @caps, there were a lot of conflicts that the builders ran into while trying to let the dirigibles dock at the empire state building. one problem was safety. unlike regular balloons, dirigibles were made of hydrogen. hydrogen is highly flamable. this would have been a problem if it was above people on the street and the building. another problem was nature. the winds, where they would have docked, would have been way to strong. as the passage says  the winds on top of the building were constanly shifting due to violent air currents.  (@num). one last reason is because there was a law against aircrafts from fly to close to neiborhoods. all and all the dirigibles ran into a lot of people.
3 the obstacles that builders faced in making the empire state building a docking point reached the greatest problems. obstacles come in all forms, depending on the size of the goal. the goal's size was immense so the range was in its greatest. the problems were law, nature, safety, and the point of docking.firstly, the main problem was the location.  the stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below.  this would have not only tore down the entire building but send it crashing down onto pedestrians within the range of eleven hundred feet it the direction it was hauled. secondly, instead of helium, dirigibles used hydrogen instead,  and hydrogen is highly flammable.  this put a safety issue, especially over a highly populated urban area, like new york. thirdly, the building was so high, it intercepted higher forces of wind.  the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents.  this could have made a dirigibles strain against the building or fresh against the mooring point. lastly, law prevented all  airships flying too low over urban areas.  as high as the empire state building was it was too close the public.overall, the builders were impacient and that created obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock at the empire state building. they made the goal so large, it caused the obstacles to reach their range of difficulty. the purpose of the empire state building may be a failure, but it still is the tallest building constructed.
4 in order for the empire state building to dock dirigibles (blimps), many obstacles had to be overcome by the architects. one of those obstacles was the empire state building's frame. if a thousand-foot dirigible was moored on top of the building with just a single cable tether, it would add tremendous stress to the foundation of the building due to the dirigibles load and wind pressure. another obstacle that the architects faced was safety. because dirigibles in the @location used hydrogen, a highly flammable gas, instead of helium, there was a high risk of the dirigible exploding, and threatening the dense population of downtown new york city. possibly the greatest obstacle that the architects had to face was high winds. on top of the empire state building, the winds were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. even if lead weights could be used to weigh down and control the docked dirigible, they would still be unsafely dangling about the pedestrians of the streets below. those are some obstacles that the architects of the empire state building faced in an attempt to dock dirigibles.
3 in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the empire state building, the architects faced many problems. one of these problems was the buildings frame. the frame needed to be modified and strengthened to accommodate the new mast. another huge obstacle was safety. in paragraph @num the author states,  hydrogen is highly flammable.  if a dirigible were to go up in @caps not only the passengers would be in danger but everybody on the crowded streets below. the winds at such a high altitude also posed a threat. paragraph @num explains that the violent air currents would cause the back of the ship to swivel all over the place, making it hard for passengers to unload. these were just some of the many problems builders faced while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the empire state building.
2 in the excerpt the builders had wanted dirigibles to dock at the top of the empire state building. they found that they couldn't do that because the winds would push the dirigibles in all different dirrections. and also there was a law that air crafts had to be a certain height in the air.
1 when building a structer as big as the empire state building and even having it dock a dirigible to the top of it means there will be challenges to face. in order for it dock. the stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation. the building would have to be @caps. all these problems must be taken into consideration. this would mean spending more money
2 the @caps of the empire state building faced many problems when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. some of the problems are some blimps are filled with hydrogen wich is highly flammable. if a blimp with hydrogen in it exploded over @location that would not turn out so good for people in new york city. those people could die. also one one blimp exploded in new jersey the blimp had hydrogen in it. so when that happened they thought a lot about the docking station and only to allow blimps with helium in them to dock there.
3 the builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. the first problem that the workers faced was that a  thousand-foot dirigible... would add stress to the building's frame  (@num). this meant that the frame would have to be strengthened. another obstacle they came across was that there was a  law against airships flying too low over urban areas  (@num). therefore, the it would be illegal to dock a ship on the building, because the airship would be too low down. finally, the most difficult obstacle they encountered was that  the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents  (@num). this made it unsafe and unpractical because the dirigibles would be above pedestrians on the street. due to all of the complications and challenges that faced the workers who were trying to allow dirigibles to dock on the empire state building, the project was never completed.
3 the obstacles; the builders of the empire state building faced in attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there were highly challenging. they delt with the frames and shapes, but theres other reasons that are not so physical.one of the greatest obstacles they faced to allow dirigibles to dock on the building was nature itself. at the top of the building winds were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. using the empire state building, where the blimps would be dangling high about pedestrians on the lower level of the street, was not safe.another particular obstacle they faced was; an existing law against airships flying to low over urban areas. this law made it illigal to ever tie up the blimp to the empire state building itself. the blimps couldnt lad on the flat roof of the empire state building. the builders of the empire state building had alot of obstacles in front of them. not just physical objects to make it easier for the dirigibles to land, but the @caps of politics and nature aswell.
3 in this excerpet from the mooring mast by marcia amidon, there was alot of examples of obstacles that the builders of the empire state building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. one obstacle that the builders faced was the weight and presure of a dirigible @caps on @caps one teather at the top of the empire state building. this was a big @caps because all the stress and pressure of the rope would pull on the building sending the preasure all the way to the bottom of the building one thousand feet below. another obstacle that the workers faced was nature its self. this was a @caps because of the high speed winds at the building shifting all the time. if a dirigible was to be teathered at the top by only one rope in the front the back of it would be free to move in the wind. this would allow the back to be able to be blown by the wind having the possibility of hitting the building. in conclusion there were many obsticles builders had to face to attempt this project.
3 in the excerpt  the mooring mast  by marcia amidon @caps the builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. the mooring mast of the empire state building was destined to never fulfill its purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before construction ever took place. the main reason for this was safety. first, there was a chance that it could catch on fire. for example, most dirigibles are made of hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. they relized how much damage it could do if it caught on fire in a densely populated area, such as downtown new york. secondly, they had another obstacle to the successful use of the mooring that was nature itself. for example, the wind on top of the building was constantly shifting due to the violent air currents. lastly dirigibles could not moor at the empire state building because they was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. this law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach it. instead of becoming the transportation of the future the idea had disappeared. they faced to many obstacles that could not be overcome.
3 in this @caps  the mooring mast  by @organization the builder of the empire state building faced many @caps during the building of the empire state building.the @caps obstacle would be the wind. because the building was so high and the more up the more air and wind they had to stop landing or drop off the dirigible. a dirigible is also a ballon or blump but there different because the dirigibles can be controlled by pappellers. another reason was the @caps equpment. they didnt have the right equipment to dock the dirigible. so they @caps from letting them dock there ever again. they also @caps to stop it because it's over hundreds of civilians and if something goes @caps the balloon could fall on the civilizians.those are the reasons why in the @caps- the mooring mast  by @organization had to face problems with docking ballons.
4 while the construction of the empire state building was in progress, the builders faced many obstacles in trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. at first, people thought it was going to be wonderful and lead to the  transportation of the future . one obstacle the builders faced was the fact that a large dirigible moored to the roof would have negative effects on the building's frame.  the stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation . the builders would have to pay @money to fix this problem. another problem that was present was also the lack of safety.  most dirigibles from outside of the united states used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable.  also, even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the violent winds would cause the back of the ship to swivel around and around the mooring mast.  even if the back of the dirigibles were weighted down with lead, it would not be safe; as the lead would be  dangling high above pedestrians on the street.  there was also a law stating that airships could not fly too low above urban areas. nature itself presented many more problems, such as winds blowing the dirigible onto the  sharp spires of other buildings.  as numerous problems became apparent after the building was finished, the idea of dirigibles being the  future of transportation  was dropped.
2 the builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. one important issue was the mooring mast. according to @organization,  the architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the empire state building's flat roof.  (paragraph @num) another problem would be the dirigible's load.  the stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation.  (para. @num) one of the main things the architects forgot to take into consideration was the buildings frame.  the steel frame of the empire state building would have to to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation. (para. @num) the builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.
2 while constructing the top of the empire state building, the builders faced many obstacles. according to the excerpt the architects couldn't just drop the mooring mast on top of the empire state building's roof. also having a thousand-foot dirigible at the top of the building while being held by a single cable would add too much stress on the frame of the building. in order to maintain the dirigible in place it would cost them money. quoating the article,  the stress of the the the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation... the empire state building would have to be modified and strengthened... sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications.  the technical and financial issues made it difficult for architects to build a mooring mast on the top of the empire state building
3 in the the excerpt  the mooring mast  by marcia amidon l sted, the builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles in the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. the architects had to acomidate a lot of thing to allow dirigibles to dock at the mooring mast. for example in @caps @num it says  the steelframe of the empire state building would have to modify and strengthen to accommodate this new situation . also in @caps @num it says  the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was natur itself. the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents . these factores and many more where the reason the mooring mast was never poot to use do to the feer of safty and law.
4 in the excerpt the mooring mast by marcia amidon l sted, the builders faced many obstacles when attempting to build the empire state building for use of dirigibles to dock there. one obstacle that the architects and engineers faced was that  most dirigibles from outside of the united states used hydrogen rather than helium  (@num) this was very dangerous because hydrogen is highly flammable. another obstacle that was faced was that  the winds at the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents.  (@num) even though the dirigible would be tied down to the mooring mast  the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast  (@num) another problem due to the winds would be that  the wind would blow the dirigible onto the sharp spires of other buildings in the area, which would puncture the dirigible's shell  (@num) a last example of an obstacle would be that there is a law stating that all  airships flying too low over urban areas  (@num) was illegal. even if there wasn't a law making it  illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area  (@num) the attemption of even trying would be very dangerous to the people around and below it, and the building itself.
2 in this project to construct a mooring mast on top of the empire state building, there were some problems. the idea of the mooring mast was to be able to dock dirigibles to the top of the empire state building + be able to have passengers get on + off the dirigible from + into the building. the big problem that it faced was the wind speeds that high up in the air. at nearly @num feet in the air the wind would be whiping around even a massive, steel, docked dirigible. when new york governor, al smith put forth ideas to construct this mast nobody realized untill after that it was a somewhat rediculous task. in paragraph @num, it states,  the mooring mast of the empire state building was destined to never fulfill it purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed.  after it was ruled impossible, people started to realize that everyone was just caught up in the new modern travel idea to be down to reality.
3 the empire state building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. some obstacles serverely affected the building attemp of the dirigible dock. for instance, the empire state building is located in a very dense urban location. at the time most dirigibles outside the united states used hydrogen insted of helium. the main difference between the two was that hydrogen is more flamable then helium. so if the hydrogen from the dirigible was to ignit then a castistrophic fire would arise. the effects could be as devistating as the hindenburg which ignited over lakehurst, new jersey on may @number @number the result of the hindenburg accident forced the architectures and enginners to look for a safer, alternate solution. explosive gases were not the only problem though. strong, gustful winds were present at the top of the empire state building. if winds were to blow a docking dirigible offcourse then the outcome would be deadly. if the dirigibles caught fire or were blown offcourse will docking then the pedistrians on the ground level could be injured.
4 there were many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the empire state building. one of the reasons was that the dirigible hanging by one cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame. this stress would cause the buildings foundation to crack. this obstacle caused the architects to have to strengthen the foundation, this cost them over sixty thousand dollars in modifications. another obstacle was they had to make another floor which would be used for passengers and would let elevators bring the passengers to the eighty-sixth floor, where their baggage and ticket area would be located. these observation areas were to double as the boarding area for dirigible passengers. once this was done, they then had complete the roof before the framing for the mooring mast could take place. another obstacle was nature itself, the winds at the top of the building were always shifting and the dirigibles, that usually land in open fields, could be weighted down with lead weights, but could not be used at the empire state building, where they would be hanging over pedestrians on the streets. another obstacle was that there was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. this would make it illegal for dirigible to tie up or even approach the empire state building. all these many obstacles led to the ideas of dirigibles and mooring mast, for the dirigibles had dissapeared.
4 in  the mooring mast , by @organization it revealed many problems with docking dirigibles on top of the empire state building. al smith, the architect working on the empire state building thought the mooring mast would go up with no problems. architects soon realized that the mooring mast would add stress to the buildings frame work and cost @money in modifications. after seeing what happened to the german dirigible  hindenburg  in lakehurst, architects soon realized that having dirigibles filled with highly-flamable hydrogen over the densely populated new york city wasn't a good idea. nature itself would not allow the mooring mass to be built.there was such violent air currents at the one thousand and fifty foot tall @organization altitude that made architects aware that this idea couldn't be upheld. the dirigible would swivel around because it couldn't be weighed down like in open landing fields. they couldnt use these weights because having weights suspended over pedestrians heads was neither practical nor safe. there is also a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. this would make it illegal to try and dock a dirigible on top of the empire state building. in the end, the idea of having dirigibles dock on the empire state building and become the new way of modern transportation was soon abolished.
2 while attempting to let dirigibles dock at the empire state building, the builders faced many obstacles. for one thing, there wasn't a whole lot of landing room in new york city for them which ultimately made things tougher. also, they were forced to put more work into the building by strengthening and modifying the steel frame of it to accommodate the new situation. a lot of money was spent on these new renevations, over sixty thousand dollars. this was done mainly to reduce stress on the building's frame. but overall they managed to get it all done, and make their way through these tricky obstacles.
3 al smith had an ambitious plan to put his empire state building on top of new york. he envisioned the skyscraper as a dirigible port and a future transport hub. techical limitations eventually proved insurmountable though. first, dirigibles had to deal with docking in an urban area. dirigibles normally dropped lead weights to secure there landings, but this would be impractical when people were on the streets below. wind was also a major problem because it made the blimp difficult to stabilize in the air. the wind would be ever more problematic in the city as if a dirigible hit a building it would puncture and fall into new york city. neither of the dirigibles that tried to moor could because of wind and other buildings. as stylish as landing in the middle of @location would have been, safety problem could not be fixed and there were too many people around to risk it.
4 in the article, the mooring mast by @organization was determined to make the empire state building the tallest building. to make the empire state building taller than the chrysler building, smith decided to create a  mooring mast  where dirigibles could land and become  transportation of the future.  however, the dirigibles never landed, because there were many obstacles in landing a dirigible on the empire state building. many dirigibles that are from outside the united states use hydrogen rather than helium. hydrogen is highly flammable, and because the empire state building is in new york city, it would be hazardous for a hydrogen filled dirigible to land, in a densely populated area, like new york city. another obstacle faced is the weather at the top of the empire state building. the winds are much stronger than down the streets. if the dirigible were able to land, the winds would be blowing the dirigible all around and out of control. finally, it is illegal to have a airships flying too low to the ground and near people. by having a dirigible land on the mast, it would break the law. there were too many obstacles for al smith's idea to become reality.
2 the obstacles the builders of the empire state building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were: the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. even if the dirigible was tethered to the mooring mast the back of the ship would swivel around the mooring mast. united states used hydrogen rather than helium and hydrogen is highly flammable.
3 the main obstacle in allowing dirigibles to dock at the empire state building's mooring mast was safety.  most dirigibles... used hydrogen... and hydrogen is highly flammable.   the owners... realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above downtown new york.  if an accident were to happen with a dirigible it would be putting hundreds of people's lives at risk. that is why this idea was unpractical and unsafe.another obstacle in allowing dirigibles to moor at the empire state building's mast was nature itself.  the winds on top were constantly shifting due to violent air currents.  this would cause the back of the ship to swivel around the mast. lead weights could be used, but that was neither practical nor safe where they would be dangling high above pedestrians.
4 allowing a dirigibles to dock upon the top of the empire state building, would leave architects faced with challenging sinerio's. adding a thousand foot dirigible onto the top of the building would add stress to the frame. a single cable tether to the blimp would not help the stress.  the stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation.  (l sted. @num) the frame of the building would have to be modified to accommodate this new situation. the greatest reason why it was never fully constructed was because of safety. most dirigibles outside the u. s used hydrogen rather than helium.  when the german dirigible hindenburg was destroyed by fire... the owners realized how much worse have it been taking place above a densely populated area.  (l sted. @num). this makes travel out side the @location with dirigibles more difficult. nature itself was a great obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast. the back of the ship will swivel around and around the mast cause of winds.  the winds on top of the building shifts due to violent air currents.  (l sted, @num). this wasn't practical nor safe. these obstacles leaves builders faced with unrealized challenges to over come.
4 one obstacle that the builders faced when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the empire state building was,  the lack of a suitable landing area.  new york city is full of buildings and there is not a lot a flat ground to land a dirigible. the builders second obstacle was that they couldn't find a way to get the mooring mast on top of the building. the builders would need to make a stronger building frame so the mast could safely be on the top of the building without adding stress to the frame. another obstacle that the builders faced was nature. the wind at the top of the building was very unpredictable and strong at times. the back of the dirigible would move from the wind, even if it was tied to the building. the last reason was that there was a law that wouldn't allow the dirigibles to fly that low over an urban area. therefore, the dirigibles couldn't dock at the empire state building.
3 the builders of the empire state building faced a few obstacles while trying to build the mast. one problem was that there was a lot of pressure and stress that would be put on the building if a dirigible was to dock there. this was because of the high wind speeds and of the sheer size of the dirigible. the designers had to make over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications to the building's framework to account for the pressure. another obstacle was that there is a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. this meant that the dirigibles would not be allowed to even get close to the building, let alone dock on it. eventually, these obstacles and other safety issues, such as hydrogen inside, the blimp being highly flammable, caused the idea to dissappear.
4 the builders of the empire state building attempted to create a mast where dirigibles could dock. at first i thought it was a great idea, then realized there were obstacles. first obstacle discovered was  most dirigibles from outside the united states used hydrogen rather than helium  (l sted). this was an issue because hydrogen is very flammable and if it were to catch on fire in new york, thousands of people would be hurt/killed. the greatest obstacle was the wind. the amount of wind changed constantly and even if the dirigible was attached properly, the back would continue to move around, which would lead to danger on the streets. the dirigible would be dangling over the pedastrians (l sted). one other reason was a legal reason. it was illegal to fly a dirigible too low over urban areas, therefore the dirigible was not allowed to get low enough to land on the building two tried and neither of them were successful. the constructors of the mooring mast were oblivious to these issues at the beginning, than realized them after. the empire state building could not be used to land dirigible due to the fact that non-u.s dirigibles used hydrogen, the current of the wind changes frequently, and it was illegal to fly the dirigible low enough to attach.
3 besides the facts that docking dirigibles on a mooring mast on the empire state building would cost over @money and add a lot of stress to the buildings frame, smith wanted to pursue his dream.unfortunatly, he couldn't do that. there are @num big reasons. in paragraph @num it says most dirigibles are too flammable. that's because they use hydrogen rather than helium. just like the german dirigible hindenburg, which was destroyed in fire in new jersey. paragraph @num says docking the dirigibles is plain dangerous because the wind would cause them to @caps all over, rather than being docked on the ground and being weighed down. lastly, it wasn't legal. paragraph @num states  ... an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. was another practical reason.  the dirigibles would not be high enough in the air to be legal, and it was highly dangerous because pedestrians below.
3 the obstacles that the builders of the empire state building faced in attempting to allow dirt dribbles to dock there was, if they dropped the mooring mast on the top of the building they would have strengthened the frame because of the wind pressure, and pressure from the single cable. also most dirigibles from out of state were highly flammable because they used hydrogen rather than helium. another problem was that new york is a highly populated city and they did not want to take the risk of having something fall from the top of the building on to citizens down below. the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature. the violent winds were constantly shifting due to the violent currents. even if that could get the dirigibles tied down the back would be flying around. they also suggest using lead weights to hold it down, but if they fell the pedestrians on the street would be in great danger. the last obstacle faced with the fact that there was a law about airships flying to low over urban areas.
3 while builders attempted to create a landing area for dirigibles to dock on the empire state building, they ran into many problems. al @caps idea sounded unrealistic but with enough motivation they were set on trying to make it happen. after so much renovation, work, and ideas they had finally realized all the potential problems.what's being built all the problems became apparent. the main reason they never used the dock is because they realized it could possibly catch fire, like it had in new jersey...  the owners of the empire state building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area... . also they warned about the intense winds on top of the tower. they feared it would continuously blow around the dirigible without a way to weigh it down. another reason is it is against the law to fly airships to low over urban areas. the builders faced many obsticles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the empire state building.
3 the obstacles the builders faced were very dangerous and unsafe. they were the difference between them failing or succeeding. one of the problems was violent air currents. the passage said that winds towards the top of the building were always shifting and they easily could have been able to swivel the dirigible. if this happened then they never would have been able to land.the next obstacle they faced was hovering over pedestrians. it just wasn't an option after the safety of the pedestrians was in danger. i was also a law that airships weren't allowed to fly that low over urban areas. so it made it illegal for them to tie up to the building or even come close to the area. it was just too dangerous to attempt.
3 the builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. by building a mooring mast, they had to make changes to the existing plans for the building's skeleton.  the steel frame of the building had been modified and strengthened  in order for the mast to fit properly and remain stable and safe.        another obstacle faced by the builders was creating a design that would allow dirigibles to dock on the mast. they were to tie the front of the aircraft to the building, however this didn't work out, because, as the author states,  even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast.  all in all, the builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles in attempt to let dirigibles dock there.
3 by attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the empire state building, the builders faced many obstacles. one of the obstacles that they faced was the re-desgning of the building.  a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame  that meant that they had to make modifications (over @money worth). another obstacle that they faced was that most of the dirigibles from outside of the united states use hydrogen rather than helium. hydrogen is highly flammable. and the greatest obstacle that the builders had was nature itself.  the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents.  even if the dirigible got parked, the winds would shake its tail too much and that wasnt safe.
2 in the excerpt there were obstacles that the builders of the empire state building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock their. al smith saw an opportunity by adding a mooring mast to the top of the building allowing dirigibles to ancher there for several hours for refueling or service, and to let passengers on and off. with this idea the architects and engineers of the empire state building had to consult with experts, by taking tours of the equipment and mooring operations at the u.s. naval air station. the architects also met with the president of a recently formed airship transport company that planned to offer dirigible service across the pacific ocean. now as you can see the builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles to allow dirigibles to dock there.
2 the obsticles the builders of the @organization in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there where the weather, and the building frame. the @caps obsticle was the wind because the winds at the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violant air currents. the wind was an obsticle because of a big gust of wind came it could not building materials or even workers off the building. a second obsticle was the building frame because the dirigible was so big that at the top of the building being held by a single cable, that would add stress to the frame and would make the building unsteady. these are two examples of the obstacles the builders working on the empire state building @organization in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.
3 the obstacles builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the empire were saefty, nature, and u.s law. saefty was a major obstacle because,  most dirigibles from outside the united states used hydrogen rather than helium and hydrogen is highly flammable  (@caps @num lin @num). nature itself was another obstacle faced in allowing dirigibles to dock at the empire state building.  the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents  (@caps @num line @num). one final obstacle that would hault the docking of dirigibles at the empire state building was u.s law. the law was agaist airships flying too low over urban areas. this law would make it illeagle for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approch the area  (@caps @num line @num).
3 the builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow the dirigibles to land there. the most prominent obstacle was that posed by nature, which was that there was always a constant change in wind direction, so the dirigibles would not be able to land safely. the architects thought that heavy weights could be put onto the ends of the blimps, but they then realized that that would not be safe for pedestrians walking below also, the building had to be a ceetain number of feet high, in order for the airship height rule to be eliminated. if it was not an something exploded, the heavily populated city of new york would be in grave danger. in theory, the mast for dirigibles was a revolutionary idea, but in reality it just wouldn't work.
4 constructing anything is always a difficult taksk, but trying to construct the worlds tallest building and have dirigibles being able to dock there is even harder. the workers who were modifing the empire state building had nemerous obstacles that stood in their way when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the empire state building. the obstacle they could not controll was nature herself. the winds were said to be  constantly shifting due to violent air currents,  according to the excerpt wich made it difficult for dirigibles to dock there, and dangerous. also another factor that was an obsticle for the constructors was the building itself. the structure of the building would have to be modified because the dirigible  would add stress to the building's frame,  so constructors wolud have to make the building support this tremendous stress. another obsticle was safty because some dirigibles were filled with hydrogen which was extremely flamable and dangerous for the massive population on the ground. these are a few of the many obstacles faced when modifing the empire state building.
3 in the excerpt the mooring mast by marcia amidon l sted the builders of the empire state building faced obstacles in attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. dirigibles are enormous steel-framed ballons they can travel for long periods at time of seventy miles per hour. thoogh dirigibles seemed great for attracting people by ways of travelin modernation, the builders faced a complex obstacle. there was no area of suitable landing for dirigibles. in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there many thoughout changes in the building needed to be considered. the load being transported off the dirigible would add stress to the building frame, as would the wind pressure. to suit the buildings with accommodating the dirigible, the price for modifications to the building would cost @money. many obstacles were scientifically proven why the dirigible could not dock at the empire state building. the issue of safety involving the hydrogen gasses being highly flammable were to much of a risk in the high populated are of new york. also nature was a large obstacle that was faced due to the wind at such a tall altitude. the law implying that airships couldn't fly too low was a practical reason why the dirigibles could not dock at the building.  one set of engineers here in new york is trying to dope out a practical, workable arrangement and the government people in washington are figuring on some safe way of mooring airships to this mast.  a quote by al smith. the obstacles involving the moderate transportation idea were too impractical in using the mooring mast for dirigibles on the empire state building
3 in  the mooring mast  by @organization, it focuses on the obstacles the builders of the empire state building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. laws made it impossible for the original purpose of the mast,  an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. this law made it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area... . some dirigibles did try, but due to wind and safety reasons the idea was dropped. the safety of all human beings took part in the construction,  when the german dirigible hindenburg was destroyed by fire...the owners of the empire state building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area... . when dealing with other countries you have to take into account that they may not use the safest things. mother nature can be a funny thing,  the winds on top of the building were constely shifting... . with the wind changing at a moment's notice it can be hard for a ship to land. when building something always be prepared for obstacles.
2 the builders of the empire state building ran into some obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.  because of all the modifications they would need to make in order to have a mooring mast would cost over sixty thousand dollars.  it was such an expensive modification because they  could not simply drop a mooring mast on the top of the  flat roof on the empire state building.  the stress a thousand-foot dirigible would put on the building's frame would be too much, this was their obstacle.  the builders needed to strengthen and modify the steel frame of the empire state building in order to hold the dirigibles as desired.
3 the builders of the empire state building faced a lot of obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the building. mainly the idea was just not practicle. having an up to @num foot blimp is full of flamable nitrogen hovering over a densely populated area was an extreme danger. one accident and tons of lives would be at stake. especially after the german blimp the hindenburg crashed, workers knew, had that happened in new york their death tolls would be huge.along with the extreme perels that the builders knew would be at stake, mother nature would also not make it easy for dirigible to dock at the empire state building. the winds atop the building were constantly shifting. the air currents were too violent and posed to many threats for danger. even when the ship was anchored, the back of the ship would swivel as if attached to a hinge. lead tools can be used to weigh down the blimp, but hanging above tons of people this would not be a safe idea.overall the idea of having a dirigible connected to the empire state building is just not safe and not worth what could be lost.
4 based on the excerpt the mooring mast by @organization, the @caps the builders of the empire state building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were fire, wind, and the laws against airships flying to low over urban areas.if they let the dirigibles dock there they would risk the dirigibles @caps on fire because dirigibles from outside the u.s. used hydrogen instead of helium. and the hydrogen is highly flammable. another obstacle would be the wind, the winds were shifting because of violent air currents. the back of the ship would swivel around, and if they put weights on the back it would not be safe for pedestrians on the street. and the last obstacle would be the law against airships flying to low over urban area, i would make it illegal for a ship to tie to the building. those were the @caps they faced.
2 the wind was a huge issue when building the empire state building. the building was so high off the ground that the top was not as stable. if they used dirigibles on the empire state building it would be dangerous because the weights would be dangling high in the air over all of the pedestrians heads. that plan was not smart or safe. the purpose to build it higher was just so it could be the tallest building, there was really no good reasons for it.
3 in this excerpt from  the mooring mast , @organization describes the architectural, chemical, and legal challenges that prevented the construction of a mooring dock for dirigibles on the top of the empire state building. despite the readiness of then- @caps al smith, who publicly announced the plan, and of john tauranac, who reported that the top of the empire state building  would serve a higher calling  than  to add a desired few feet,  @organization contends that the failure of the mast  should have been apparent before it was ever constructed .according to the article, the mast, and a moored dirigible,  would add stress to the building's frame.  more than sixty thousand dollars was spent to accommodate the pressure. foreign dirigibles also contained hydrogen, which was more flammable than american-used helium. an explosion above the empire state building would be devastating to the city. an existing law prevented dirigibles from  even approach ing   the building. @organization uses these reasons to detail the unrealistic nature of the mooring mast.
4 the builders of the empire states building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. for instance, in paragraph @num, the author mentions that they had to consider the hindenburg incident that took place on may @number @number  the owners of the empire state building realized how much worse the accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown new york,  says the author. they realized that the safety of the people has to come first in all scenarios. also, another obstacle that al smith and the builders faced was docking the dirigible when people are down below. in paragraph @num, the author says:  the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself.  @caps dirigibles are often docked in open fields, weights to hold down the back of the ship could be used safely. but above a highly populated area was out of the question because lead weights dangling high above pedestrians is a safety violation. the builders had many obstacles in designing the use of the mooring mast.
2 the builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. one of the problems was that a thousand-foot dirigible held by a single cable tether would add stress to the frame. the obstacle they went through was to make the frame stronger. in paragraph @num it states the obstacle they went through to make the building stronger.  the architects designed a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower.  and  the rocket-shaped mast would have four wings at its corners. other obstacles they went through was making sure the mooring mast was tall enough, and in paragraph @num smith says,  people in washington are figuring on some safe way of mooring airships to this mast. 
0 building a big piece of work is not easy. you have to fix the negatives and do everything correctly. you never know at times you have to tear things down for hard work to be completed right. when looking at you did right things to prevent bad things from occurring.you may face a whole bunch of things when building. the empire faced attemps one allowed to dock when building the dirigibles to the dock was not performed or built right. even though said, swinging to climb on as build pressure by.although, building things is hard. you get the beauty and hardship out of it. it helps you reminded of your wells done correctly.
3 al smith and the engineers faced many obsticles attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the empire state building. one obsticle that they faced was that most of the dirigibles used hydrogen, hydrogen is a very flammable chemical, this could have led to the empire state building burning down and killing millions. another obsticle they faced was mother nature, in a height like @number ft, theire are incredible winds blowing, and someone even unexpected, they can blow the dirigible into the building, causing it to be fatal. findly, the law prohibites the dirigible to be  flying too low over urban areas.  therefore doing this would be illegal. the building faced many obstacle, it got through most of them, but in the end it would be extremly unsafe to go on with mast.
1 in constructing and building the empire state building to make it allowable for dirigables to dock there took alot of thinking on the builders' part. first they had to see what the building could handle and try to calculate what it held so it wouldn't fall. then they had to figure out the safety of the passengers and pedestrians, a way to get in and out as safe and easy as possible. despite all the work the builders' put into crafting al smith's idea, the chances just weren't realistic at all to the public and the plan had to be shut down. although it makes a good story and is a crutial learning block for constructers to be.
2 in the excerpt  the mooring mast  by @organization, the author described the obstacles the builders of the empire state building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. an architect named al smith was a four-term governor of new york who headed efforts to construct the empire state building after his years in office. he imagined the top of the building to be a  higher calling . he pictured it to be equipped for an age of transportation that was then the only dream of avation pioneers. it seemed possible in his eyes, till the obstacles turned up. the first obstacle that struck, was the lack of suitable area in new york city. they would have to clear about four blocks in the bussy city! the architects and engineers of the empire state building consulted with experts, but it didn't plan out too well. over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the buildings framework. the building would now be @number floors, with a glassed-in observation area on the @number floor. in the end, the greatest obstacle was just nature itself.
4 mooring dirigibles would not be good at all if they were being moored on top of the empire state building. one of the reasons that mooring a dirigible on the top of the building is most dirigibles that would come to this dock from outside the u.s. used hydrogen instead of helium. the hydrogen is extremely flammable and after the hindenburg exploded, it would be to unsafe to have a hydrogen filled dirigibles in a highly populated area such as new york city.another obstacle that was being faced was a climate problem. this was the biggest problem.  the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents,  (paragraph @num). if the winds were this rapid the back of the dirigible would be swinging around freely. this could potentially cause danger if the back was to hit a building near by or start swinging out of control and break loose from the building.the last problem that was faced based on the story is that docking a dirigibles would be against the law. the exsisting law stated that an airship couldn't fly to low over urban areas. if the dirigible was able to dock at the empire state building, it would be too low over an urban area. this made it impossible for the empire state building to have a dock for dirigibles.
4 in the excerpt of  the mooring mast  by @organization, the builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. one obstacle that prevented the docking of dirigibles at the empire state building was the use of hydrogen rather than helium in dirigibles from out of the united states. this was a problem because hydrogen is very flammable. when the german dirigible was destroyed in new jersey the architects of the empire state building realized how dangerous it was. another obstacle faced by the builders was the weather. the weather affected the use of the mooring mast because  the winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents.  a practical reason why the mooring mast could not dock dirigibles at the empire state building was because of the law against airships. the law said that airships could not fly too low over urban areas making it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to a building. these are a few of the many obstacles faced by the builders of the empire state building which prevented the use of the mooring mast.
3 in the excerpt the mooring mast by marcia amidon l sted the builders of the empire state building had to deal with many obsticles while trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. the author tells us the readers that dirigibles were actually enormous steelframed balloons. with envelopes of cotton fabric filled with hydrogen and helium to make them lighter than air. while the builders were trying to droop a mooring mast on top of the empire state building's flat roof. in the excerpt tells us the reader that  a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building frame. the stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. all though the dirigible is as light as the air it could mess up the frame of the building. another obsticle the buildors had to face was when the german dirigible hindenburg was destroyed by fire in @location, new jersey on may @number @number the owner of the empire state building realized how much worse it would have been the accident happened in new york such as a populated are as downtown.  most dirigibles from outside of the united states used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable . even though the empire state building didn't get to put moors on top of the building it still became the world's tallest building.
2 there were many obstacles the builders faced when trying to allow dirigibles to dock on the empire state building. one of the obstacles was nature. the winds at the top of the empire state building were always shifting due to violent air currents. even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around. another obstacle builders faced was a law not allowing airships to fly too low over urban areas. this law would make it illegal for a  ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach it.
1 in the article the mooring mast by marcia amidon l sted the architects of the empire state building faced multiple obsticals in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. first there was the obvious concern, safety, a dirigible dangling over new york city does not seem very safe. and it @caps wasn't a reasonable thing to build, the empire state building was already tall enough, why build a mast that probably won't get much use anyway.
2 in the excerpt the mooring mast by @organization, the builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. first, the wind was to fast for the builders at that altitude. this shows that they didn't want any dirigibles to fall on any stores below. second, they didn't finish the building because the building couldn't hold all the weight that they wanted to put on top of it. third, hydrogen is highly flammable and could catch on fire easily. in brief, there were many problems that made the empire state building a bad idea to dock a dirigible.
3 the builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. one obstacle was the fact that dirigibles contain highly flammable gases. if the blimp was docked over a large city like new york city, it would be very dangerous if a blimp did catch on fire. another obstacle was that the docking system would not work as well as planned, nor would it be safe. these airships are at the mercy of the winds and weather. in normal cases of docking dirigibles on open landing fields, they are weighted down on the front and back. if the blimps were to stay in place on the empire state building, they would need to have a weight on the back as well as the front, which would end up dangling over the city. without the weight on the back, the blimp would spin around the mooring mast. finally, the height at which the dirigibles would have to be would not be safe. if the blimp were to the blown by the wind, the blimp would crash into the pointy tops of nearby buildings. these are the obstacles the builders faced when trying to allow dirigibles to dock on the empire state building.
4 the builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.  the first obstacle the builders faced was that the building itself would need to be modified.  the architects in charge of adding the mooring mast realized that if they were to add the mast as-is, and start mooring dirigibles to it, then there would be too much stress put on the empire state buildings frame.  for this reason they first had to make @money worth of changes to the building in order to sufficiently strengthen it's frame (paragraph @num).  the second obstacle which builders faced in trying to make it possible to more dirigibles to a mast on the empire state building was just general safety.  after the hindenburg disaster of @number took place, it became clear to the architect in charge of the project how truly catastrophic an accident like that would of been if it occurred over as highly populated a place as @caps (paragraph @num).  it wasn't just possibility of catastrophic disaster which added to the worry about safety though.  considering the constant violent wind gusts which happen at the height of the mast, architects realized that any dirigible moored up there would be constantly swinging rapidly around the mast.  the way this problem is solved when mooring dirigibles on ground is through the hanging of weights on it's back, yet this would present yet another safety issue because of the weight was to fall on the people below it could easily kill somebody (paragraph @num).  the final obstacle architects faced was a law outlawing a dirigible flying so low near urban areas in the first place.  in the end, the fact that there was so many obstacles prevented the idea of mooring dirigibles there from ever becoming reality at all.
3 in the excerpt  the mooring mast  by marcia amidon @caps there was a few obstacles while trying to build a dock for the empire state building.the first obstacle was the little room they had for a landing spot. new york has alot of people in it and alot of buildings.  the one obstacle to there expanded use in new york city was the lack of a suitable landing area.  they were very big so they needed enough room not to hit anything else.secondly was safety. they had to think about all the people and how close it would be to the building.  the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents.  if the wind blew to hard it could swing it back into the building.lastly the danger of the weights being over a whole bunch of peoples heads is pretty serious.  ... using these at the empire state building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street...  if one was ever to fail it would probly kill someone. no one would ever get over what happened.
1 the empire state building builders faced  different obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. the builders first had to learn about the mooring lines. they  consulted with experts, taking tours of the equipment and mooring operations  to learn more about them first hand. the builders also had to worry about the frame of the empire state building. the frame  would have to be modified and strengthened to accomodate this new situation.  this meant the builders would have to go back and work on the frame again. attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the empire state building caused the builders to face different obstacles.
3 the builders of the empire state building went through many difficult obstacles trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. one of the difficult obstacles the builders went through is that the winds on top of the building were always shifting.  the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting do to violent air currents.  this quote is describing how bad the winds were and how it made it difficult for the builders to work. to solve that problem, the builders could have weighed weighed down the back with lead; but that would cause it to be dangling high above pedestrians on the street which isn't safe.  but using these at the empire state building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was not safe.  this quote is explaining how using lead would not be safe. another problem is that it is illegal for airships to fly too low to urban areas.  @caps an existing law against airships flying to low over urban areas.  this quote explains the law about airships. clearly, the builders had many difficult obstacles.
1 the obstacles the builders of the empire state building faced in attempting to allow drigibles to dock there was that he realized that he was close to losing the title of world's tallest building, also some of his opinions were proven wrong because of facts. another obstacle was trying to accomplish everything he says he was going to do on time. he needed to react more realistic than what he was thinking of doing. most obstacles had to do with  nature itself.  such as the wind which would make it swivel around.
3 the mooring mast, authored by @person, presents two main obstacles the builders of the empire state building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. the first problem was the uncontrollable factor of mother nature. with high speed air currents would cause  the back of the ship to swivel around and around the mooring mast.  if the dirigible was unable to dock correctly, the dangers would be the fact it was  dangling high above pedestrians on the street, (which) was neither practical nor safe.  another problem the builders encountered was the already existing law that made sure airships don't fly too low over cities. the author notes,  this law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area.  because of mother nature and pre-existing legislature, the builders of the empire state building had to overcome enigmatic problems.
2 in the excerpt 'the mooring mast' by @organization, the obstacles the builders of the empire state building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock here. one example of this is  the obstacle to their expanded use into new york city was lack of a suitable landing area . this shows that the mooring mast is going to be a problem because its lacked of a suitable landing area, meaning it's to difficult for landing, it's not ment for docking. another example is 'a thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether would add stress to the building frame.' this shows that the building is not stable enough for landing for a final example  the greatest obstacles to the successful use of a mooring mast was nature itself.' this shows that the weather can change, and it will affect its landing. these examples show how in the excerpt 'the mooring mast' by @organization, the obstacles that the builders faced.
1 some obstacles that the empire state builders had while creating the empire state building is having to deal with all fast winds. this reason being is because the giant needle that was build on top of the building was waving back an forth. which mad it harder to keep in place.another obstacle would be, @caps bringing the dirigible or blimps towards the giant needle. it would pouncher the blimp. there was only made of cotton fabric.
3 the builders had many obstacles in their way to accomplish their idea of docking dirigibles. one main problem was that most dirigibles around the world used hydrogen gas which is highly flammable which can make things very dangerous at such an altitude.                                                 the greatest obstacle to it's success was nature itself. the winds where the docking would occur were constantly shifting and this would make the stability of the dirigible very difficult with the back end stretching so far away from the tower. another reason this wouldn't work was because of an already existing law against air ships flying so low over urban areas.
4 in the excerpt  the mooring mast  written by @organization, the empire state building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. in paragraph @num under  the fate of the mast , the first line says  the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. strong winds due to violent air currents would make it impossible to dock a dirigible on the empire state building. the wind would blow the dirigible off the mast into new york city. in paragraph @num under  the fate of the mast , a line states  the other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the empire state building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas.  this law made it illegal for dirigibles and other aircraft to even fly in such and urban area like new york. one final obstacle is safety precautions. in paragraph @num a line states,  most dirigibles from outside of the united states used hydrogen rather than helium.  if a dirigible were to crash and it had this highly flammable gas it would create a massive disaster. violent winds, laws, and safety precautions are all against the docking of dirigibles at the mooring mast.
3 the builders of the empire state building where faced with some obstacles in order to allow dirigibles to dock there. saftey was the main focus because new york is a densly populated area and many dirigibles where filled with highly flameable hydrogen.one problem was that the builders relized the dirigible would be hanging by a single cable teather wich would add stress to the frame so they would need to adjust the building and strengthen the the frame. this costed over sixty thousand dollars to adjust. after that was taken care of the builders still had other problems.another problem the builders faced was that since the building was in a highly populated area many pedestrians walk, below where the dirigibles would be docked. the winds at the top would cause the dirigible to blow around and lead weights could not be used because of the dangers of them falling
0 in the excerpt  the mooring mast , by @organization, the builders of the empire state building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. one obstacle was when al smith realized that he was close to not winning the world's tallest building. it talks about it in paragraph @num. then he annonced that the building would reach @number feet. that's an obstacle because without the building he cant make the dirigible, and he always wanted compitition so his building had to be the winning one and he had to build the dirigible.
3 the builders of the empire state building faced problems to allow dirigibles to dock there. some problems were that most dirigibles from other countries are filled with hydrogen which is highly flammable, also the winds at the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents and could cause the dirigible to wrap around the building. another @caps the builders faced was a existing law against airships flying to low in urban areas, this law would make it illegal for the dirigible to even come near the building. they also had to spend @money to upgrade the framework so it does not put to much strain on the top of the building.
3 based on the article  the mooring mast  written by @organization, the empire state building faced many obstacles. there are three main reasons why the @caps. s.b. was not used for the purpose it was constructed for. the point of the @caps.s.b. was so that dirigibles can stop and refuel. dirigibles is an old word for blimps. the obstacle the @caps.s.b. had to over come were modifications, nature, and the law. they had to pay @money in modifications on the @caps.s.b. for the framework. the second was nature, the winds would make the back of the dirigibles move around, they wanted to put weights on the back of them but that was not safe. last but not least the law, the dirigibles cant be as low as the @caps.s.b. because its too low and they cant fly low over urban areas.
2 based on the excerpt, the obstacles the builders of the empire state building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was a huge challenge for them to face. for example, mother nature itself was one of they're huge challenges they would mostly face. at the top of the empire state building, winds were constantly shifting and shifting due to violent air currents. as soon as an dirigible would hook up to the building, workers would have to find a way to keep they're airship from crashing into the building from the rusty winds at the top of the building. therefore, if a dirigible- crashed anywhere on the ground it would burst into an inferno because the inside of a dirigible is filled with hydrogen and helium, so if it did crashed it will involve heat and fire that would be coming from the sparks it prevents as it crashes on the ground.
3 in @date, the empire state building was constructed and would be used to house a new form of travel. the mooring mast, constructed at the top of the building would be used to dock one-thousand foot dirigibles; the future of travel. in theory, the blimp would be docked at the mast, using an electric winch, but in reality, there was no safe way of doing so at such a high altitude. another challenge faced was the highly flammable gas, hydrogen, which was used. one lit match could send the steel frame plummeting to the earth below. the soft fabric which covered the steel frame could easily be punctured, which was unsuitable for an urban area.the men constructing the blimp either looked over, or forgot the elements of nature which restricted this project. at the peak of the building, winds reached high velocities, and shifted directions rapidly which would have rapped the dirigible around the mast. the greatest obstacle was the law, restricting airships from flying too low over new york's growing urban civilization. in the empire state building's history, one blimp has attempted to simulated dock, and another has performed a newspaper stunt. any man his right mind would see that this project was doomed before it had begun.
2 people involved in the design and construction of the empire state building were faced with a few major obstacles in attempting to transform the idea of docking dirigibles to reality. one of the biggest complications was that if a massive dirigible was tied to the building by a  cable tether  then stress would be put on the building's frame. the builders and architects had to find a way to allow the stress to travel down the foundation of the building. they spent over @money modifying the framework (from paragraph @num). in paragraph @num we read that the architects and builders worked through the obstacle of storage by putting the winches and control machinery in the base of the shaft of the  conical roof .
2 the builder of the empire state building faced many obstacles in the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. one of these problems, (that was noticed after building of the mooring mast), was how difficult it would be to keep a blimp steady and attached to something without pulling the building over on itself. another issue was safety and one thing that was unsafe about it was that most dirigibles from other countries use hydrogen instead of helium, which is very flammable. one more reason was because of high air currents that would blow the back part of the ship around uncontrollably.
3 the mooring mast of the empire state building was destined to never fulfill its purpose for reasons such as, safety, nature, and the laws. the greatest reason was safety because most dirigibles from outside of the united states used hydrogen rather than helium. hydrogen is very flammable. the german dirigible, hindenburg, was destroyed by fire in lakehurst, new jersey, on may @number @number this accident could have been much worse if it happened in a densely populated area like downtown new york. nature was the biggest obsticle to get around because of the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. this would cause the back of the ship to swivel around. this is not good because it would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street. finally, there are laws against airships flying too low over urban areas. that law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area. in conclusion, because of these three major reasons, the mooring mast of the empire state building was destined to never fulfill its purpose.
3 in this excerpt, the mooring mast by marcia amidon l sted, there were many obstacles the builders of the empire state building faced, in attempting dirigibles to dock there. one obstacle they faced, was that they lacked a suitable landing area. because of this, they came up with the idea of having the passengers get on and off the dirigible by walking down a gangplank to an open observation platform. another obstacle they faced, was that  the stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below.  another main obstacle that the builders faced was that  the steel frame of the empire state building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation.  in the end, the idea of the mooring mast, was a failure. the builders didnt think about potential problems that could occur. for example, nature itself, the law against airships flying too low over urban areas, and even fires, due to the gas (hydrogen) used in some dirigibles.
3 if the empire state building were to dock dirigibles, there would be many problems in the way. they had a lack of landing area for an almost one-thousand foot blimp. this dirigible being held by a single tether to the empire state building would put a large amount of stress on the building's structure risking a possible collapse if continued. if they were to use the empire state building, they would have to modifiy it and use thousands of dollars in the process. even then if the dirigible held onto the building, the back of the blimp would sway with the high winds and that might risk the safety of the passengers. all in all the idea of landing a dirigible on a gigantic building is just a bad idea
3 the builders faced many obstacles in attempting to ensure that dirigibles could dock at the empire state building. for example, the first problem that arose was construction of the mast atop the building. according to the excerpt,  a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame.  from this you immediately know that the frame of the empire state building would have to be properly modified in order for the dirigible to safely and successfully dock at the mast. another minor issue was making the whole construction look decorative.  ... the architects designed a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from inside...  @caps,  the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself.  @caps, the winds at that altitude would have been to unstable for a dirigible to dock. the problem is that the winds could potentially  swing  the rear of the dirigible around the mast, which is extremely dangerous and risky.
4 the builders of the empire state building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. one obstacle was that most dirigibles from outside of the united states used hydrogen instead of helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. when a german dirigible was destroyed by fire in new jersey, the owners of the empire state building realized it would be much more dangerous in a crowded area. a second obstacle was that the dirigible with be swivelling around the mast because of violent air currents. the dirigible would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, which is definitely not safe. a third obstacle was that there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. this law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area. thankfully, by the late @number the idea of using the mooring mast for dirigibles had quickly disappeared, and the builders had no more obstacles to face.
0 the empire state building was facing of with chrysler building that was being constructed. chrysler building had a trick up his sleeve by constructing @number foot spire inside the building and the shocked the public. bring it to a hieght of @date feet, @number feet taller than the originally announced hieght of the empire state building. soon to be the tallest building. the empire state building was destined to neve fulfill it's purpose
3 architects designing the empire state building with the intent of docking zeppelins to it at heights of over @num feet no doubt had a lot to go through. according to  the mooring mast  by @organization, obstacles included adding stress to the buildings frame with a blimp attached, and the design of the mooring mast itself. the article says that  the stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation  in order to make docking safe. the mooring mast was composed mostly of steel. other problems facing architects was the wind factor, and keeping zeppelins immobile in the  constantly shifting  and  violent air currents  at @num feet. safety hazards also came into account, because architects realized that should another accident like the hindenburg's occur again in new york city, results could be disastrous. as such, the empire state building's mooring mast for zeppelins never went into operation.
3 the obstacles builders faced were weather, hight of the structure, stability of the structure, and worriying about the highly flamable gases from the dirigible. the weather affected having the dirigible dock there because the winds could whip it around, knocking it into nearby buildings. the structure needs to be stable at it's hight so the dirigible doesn't knock over the empire state building. the author marcia amidon @caps states,  the steel frame of the empire state building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation,  this was nessisary so the dirigible wouldn't knock over the empire state building, wiping out a lot of new york. the highly flammable gases would need to be under intense supervision, because if they caught of fire the empire state building and pedestrians, and downtown new york would catch of fire. these reasons are the obstacles they faced and why a mooring mast was never completed and used.
3 in the excerpt from  the mooring mast , by @organization, the builders of the empire state building faced very difficult obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. one of the most difficult obstacles was  nature itself . there were very strong winds that  were constantly shifting due to violent air currents.  the back of the dirigible would move around and around even if it were  tethered to the mooring mast . also, dirigibles usually landed in open landing fields and would be weighted down with lead weights. however, weighting down dirigibles with lead weights at a height of about @number feet in a place as densely populated as new york city would be  neither practical nor safe . lastly, there  was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas , meaning the idea of a mooring mast on the empire state building was simply unpractical.
2 the builders of the empire state building had many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. the number one obstacle was safety. the builders thought to themselves, how are we going to safetly land a dirigible thousands of feet above the ground, while its freely floating in midair? plus when you attempt this you are above crowded new york streets. if there was ever a malfunction or error while docking then thousands of people may lose their lives. its much easier lending dirigibles in an open field than in mid-air because you have much more room, your planting the dirigible on secure ground, and you can weigh it down so it doesnt move around. yet landing in open fields is dangerous because on @date in @location, new jersey the german dirigible hindenburg was destroyed by a fire. this example shows how that if that were to happen in mid-air over a crowded new york city street or block then many more casualties would have been recorded. these obstacles were real and these are some of the reasons why the idea of landing a dirigible in mid-air slowly went away, because it wasnt the most logical idea.
1 in the excerpt  the mooring mast  by @organization, the builders of the empire state building faced some obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.although this sounded like a great idea and seemed possible at first, it was not. the idea of the mooring mast of the @caps state building was neither practical nor safe. in paragraph fourteen, marcia states why this dirigible idea wasn't so safe.  the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. in the last sentence of paragraph fourteen, the author states another reason the idea wasnt safe nor practical.  they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, 
3 from the excerpt  the mooring mast  by marcia amidon @organization the builders faced obstacles to allow dirigible to dock on the empire state building. one obstacle that the builders faced is the lack of suitable landing area on the roof. for that reasoning they needed more room to dock the dirigible. later they had to put a steel needle on top of the empire state building so the balloons could dock up and let people out. next obstacle that they faced was that  outside the u.s. used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. therefore it was a risk to take to place a dirigible on top of the building if it blown up the building. another reasing of an obstacle is that it was against the law for airships flying too low over urban areas for it can tie up and forceful winds will blow it in different directions. for that reasoning the winds could force the balloon to go in different directions and hit other building if the winds are strong. those are obstacles the builders faced in the excerpt  the mooring mast  by @organization.
3 in the excerpt the mooring mast by marcia amidon @caps the builders of the empire state building some obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. these obstacles included the added, stress to the buildings frame, the excerpt states in paragraph nine  a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether would add stress to the building's frame.  this obstacle would could cause the whole building structure to collapse which could cause death and alot of destruction. another obstacle included nature. the excerpt states in paragraph fourteen  the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents.  these violent air current could cause the dirigibles to lose control and hit the building and other buildings around it. the stress being added to the empire state building and nature itself were the two main obstacles for the builders.
3 the builders of the empire state building faced a lot of obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. a few of these problems included designing the mast and making sure that it was safe enough for dirigible to dock on. according to the excerpt,  the steel frame of the empire state building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation.  this meant that the builders would have to change the plan of how the building could be built to be able to hold the dirigibles. after they constructed a new layout for the building the conflict of safety came into play. stated in paragraph @num,  the greatest reason was one of safety: most dirigibles from outside of the united states used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly inflammable.  another big safety issue was  nature itself.   the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents.  the air currents made it so that they had to tie down the dirigible, but even then it is dangerous because it would be dangling over pedestrians on the street. the design and safety of the building both were big obstacles that the builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.
2 when the builders of the empire state building were constructing the mooring mast for the dirigibles, they faced obsticles that could have jeopardized the project. there were two aspects that the builders had to pay extra attention to, structural integrity, and design. since  the architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the building's flat roof,  the builders had to modify the building's frame. these modifications cost over @money. the other aspect that posed an obsticle was design. the architect, john tauranac, described the plan to make the mast  more than ornamental,  and  more than something as mundane as a water tank. so, to fufill the architect's high aspirations, the builders constructed a  shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from the inside. this required a lot of extra work for the builders. dispite the obsticles, the boilders got the job done.
3 there were some great obstacles for the dirigibles to be able to land and dock on the empire state building. at first the idea was great and staggering people's mind, but when the mast was being built the people realized it would not work. the first problem for the dirigble the law for airships to be so low over urban areas which makes it illegal for the ship to even be that close the second problem was  the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents (paragraph @num)  which means it would be very dangerous for the passengers to be comming on and off board of the dirigible. the last problem is that foreign dirigibles use hydrogen which is flammable and to put it over a dencely populated area could cause horrific damage. these precautions would have to be taken which were obstacles for the empire state building.
3 the builders of the empire state building faced three main challenges while attempting to make the mooring mast accessible to derigibles. most foreign derigibles still used hydrogen; a highly flammable gas. a fire on the streets of new york would be disastrous. there were also fierce, ever changing wind currents above the building. these winds would make the back of the dirigible  swivel around and around the mooring mast.  @caps, there was a law in place preventing dirigibles from flying too low when over urban areas. this law made it illegal for dirigibles to tether to the building or even approach it. those three factors made the mooring mast  neither practical nor safe. 
4 in the @date's al smith hoped to build the world's largest dirigible dock in new york. however, during construction, the empire state building's mooring system ran into many problems one obstacle was the harsh winds high above new york. in paragraph @num, the author says,  the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents.  these wins caused the dirigibles tail end to move around while docked, causing unsafe landings and take-offsanother obstacle faced was a law that prohibited airships from flying low over urban areas. this was feared because of the hindenburg crash in @number the building officials feared if that crash were to happen in new york then the damage would have been catastrophic. the final obstacle faced by the empire state building's mooring system was that many blimps from overseas used hydrogen instead of helium to fly. hydrogen is extremely flammable and had a crash occurred over new york, the damage would have devastated the city and would have caused a tremendous amount of casualties
2 based on the @caps  the mooring mast  by @organization, the builders of the empire state building faced many obsticals in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. many obsticals came forth with building the empire state building with al smith constructing the whole building. with al smith constructing the whole building, he was determined to outstrip the height. al smith secretly constructed a @number foot spire inside the building, the shocked the media and public by hoisting it up to the top of the chrysler building. another obstical that was faced during the building of the empire state building was the idea of having dirigibles being able to dock at the very top of the building. the idea of having the dirigibles being docked at the top of the empire state building, the dirigibles would only be held by a single cable tether, which would add amounts of stress to the buildings frame. the greatest obstical that came to building the empire state building with the idea of docking dirigibles at the top was safety. most dirigibles from outside the u. s. used hydrogen rather than helium, & hydrogen is very flammable and if anything to happen it could destroy new york. these are the reasons why the builders of the empire state building faced my obsticals in the @caps  the mooring mast  by @organization.
4 in the excerpt  the mooring mast  by @person, the builders of the empire state building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. one of the obstacles they faced was figuring a practical and safe way to dock the dirigibles. practicity and safety were an obstacle because the builders of the empire state building were the first to attempt a docking dirigibles on air, @caps they had no past trials to refer to. in this project practicity and safety worked together. for example  ..engineers  had  to dope out a practical, workable arrangement...  @caps that the airships could be moored to the mast easily and secure. this would assure the passengers safety as well as stability to the building.the second obstacle the builders faced was distributing the stress added to the building as the dirigible docked.  the stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation.  @caps all of this stress to the foundation was a challenge because the foundation  ... was nearly eleven hundred feet below.  another challenge that arose was that, to accommodate this situation  the steelframe  of the building had  to be modified and strengthened...  the modification to the buildings framework was worth  over sixty thousand dollars...  in conclucion, the builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles and attempting to dock dirigibles in their building.
2 the obstacles that the builders of the empire state building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to adopt there was very hard for them. a dirigible having to dock on the empire state building is probably not easy. a mooring mast added to the top of the building. would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling. the obstacles were that al smith demanded the builders to make the empire state building more tall. also to make it more ornamental, and to put in like a pyramid at the top. the workers were exhausted. the one obstacle that the builders did was to expand their use in new york city was the lack of a suitable landing area. the other obstacles were that the architects and the builders of the empire state building consulted with experts, taking tours of the equipment and mooring operations. the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was by nature itself.
3 one of the original purposes of the empire state building was to be a loading dock for dirigibles or blimps. this was meant to help new york be a leader in modern traveling. yet there were many obstacles that eventually put an end to the idea of a mooring mast. a major problem was nature itself. the wind on top of the building was constantly changing because of the air currents. this would cause the dirigible to swing around the mast. the idea of weighting the back was immediately ruled out because of the danger imposed on the pedestrians on the street. also there was a law that stated airships could not fly too low over urban areas, which would make it illegal for and dirigible to tie up or even approach the area.
0 dirigibles had a top speed of eighty miles. some were as long as one thousand feet, the same length as four blocks in new york city. so the one obstacle to their expanded use in new york city was the lack of a suitable landing area. al smith saw an opportunity for his empire state building. he said a mooring mast added to the top of the building would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service, and to let passengers off and on. dirigibles were docked by means of an electric winch, which hauled in a line from the ship and then tied it to a mast so by swinging the body the passengers could safely get on and off.
3 although the builders of the empire state building managed some of the obstacles with allowing dirigibles to dock there, many of the issues were left unsolved. when designing the mast to accommodate the blimp, the architects realized the pressure this would put on the building's frame. in order to support the weight of the dirigible they needed to make  over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications  (paragraph @num) to the structure of the building. also, the builders had to develop a way to tether the dirigible to the building to allow passengers and supplies to unboard. therefore, the architects designed a  rocket-shaped mast... of shiny aluminum... which also housed elevators and stairs  (paragraph @num). however, the builders forgot to incorporate the winds at the top of the building. once the front of the dirigible was docked, the back of the blimp would swivel around irradically. furthermore, the builders disregarded existing laws that banned dirigibles from flying low over cities, as it states in paragraph @num. this precaution was due to the safety hazard that these dirigibles posed since they were highly flammable from the hydrogen used. these imposing obstacles made the use of the empire state building is a dock unrealistic.
3 the empire state building was built as the tallest building in the world and even today still remains one of the tallest. it had design plans with more of a purpose then just being the tallest building, however. it was supposed to serve as a passenger exchange and a refueling dock for dirigibles. most people do not know this though because there were many complications involved with the architectural designs of this plan for the mast. architects knew it would not be easy to build such a creation and that they  could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the empire state building.  they knew, for example that the building needed to be modified to accommodate for the added stress from the mast and the height of the building would need to be increased. they made the necessary changes to the building but the realities of the progect soon set in, and the mast was never built,  the greatest reason being for safety.  the hydrogen used to power the dirigibles was highly flamable and endangered the citizens of new york  also, according to the aricle,  the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself.  there are powerful winds at that high of an altitude that would blow and make it difficult as for the dirigibles to be properly controlled and navigated.
1 there were many obstacles the builders of the empire state building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. the man who came up with the plan was al smith, who saw the opportunity to add a mooring mast to the top of the building. which this would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service, and to let passengers on or off. but with this came lots of work. and they couldn't simply drop a mooring mast on top of the building. the architects had to make plans on how they were going to set up the mooring mast. in the story it says  once the architects had designed the mooring mast and made changes to the existing plans for the building's skeleton, construction proceeded as planned. when the building had been framed to the @number floor, the roof had to be completed before the framing for the mooring mast could take place. the mast also had a skeleton of steel and was clad in stainless steel with glass windows. 
3 in the exerpt  the mooring mast  by @organization, the builders faced obstacles in an attempt as to allowing dirigibles to dock. one example of an obstacle that the builders had to face was how to attach the mooring mast on top of the building. in paragraph nine it says,  the architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the empire state building's flat roof.  they had to come up with a safe way to attach it. another example of an obstacle was that they had to strength and modified the building because in paragraph nine it stated that  a thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame.  the last example was in paragraph nine when they explained that  the stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundren feet below.  the stress might be so much for the building that it could cause the building to collapse. in the excerpt  the mooring mast  by marcia amidon @organization the builders faced many obstacles as to allowing dirigibles to dock on the empire state building in new york city.
3 in the @caps the @caps mast by @organization, the builders of the empire state building faced numerous obstacles. the largest obstacle they faced was safety, most dirigibles who were comming from outside the united states used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is very flammable. another obstacle was just nature itself. winds were constantly shiffting caused by violent air currents. another obstacle was there was a law against airships flying to low over urban areas. the builders should have relized all the hazards. they were facing, and just dropped the idea of using the moorning mast for dirigibles and their passengers.
2 throughout the excerpt, obstacles the builders faced were difficult. many fell under being able to let dirigibles dock there. some difficulties the faced were that outside from the states, more dirigibles were being made, but with  hydrogen rather than helium . they stated,  hydrogen is highly flamable . there was fear for the people, since new york was so densely populated. there were also whether problems. winds were constantly shifting.  ship would swival around and around . realizing the danger, all they could do was shut it down.
2 the obstacles the builders of the empire state building faced by attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were harsh. the builders, in theory, thought everything would work perfectly. they had to face that they did not do enough to see if there would be any problems with having the dirigibles dock there. as i read i noticed the building never fulfilled it's purpose. this was because most dirigibles from outside of the united states used hydrogen, not helium, hydrogen is very flammable. on may @number @number the owners of the empire state building realized how much worse a fire could have been if it were to happen above a densely populated area such as downtown new york. so in reality this idea was not safe and the builders had to go through building it, having it all done. then realizing the idea was not pursuable.
3 the obstacles the builders of the empire state building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was the lack of a suitable landing area. also a thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame. to do that they would need a lot of money like sixty thousand dollars.another reason was safety because most dirigibles from outside of the united states used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. but the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents.
4 the builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. one obstacle was the weight of the dirigible  or blimp , lust wind pressure, caused too much stress on the building's frame. the architects easily overcame this obstacle. they strengthened to iron frame of the building so it could withstand the added stress. unfortunately, the other obstacles were not overcome, and led to the abandonment of the use of the mast for docking dirigibles. the biggest problem a safety. many blimps used hydrogen rather than helium to keep it afloat, which is highly flammable. there was too much of a risk of the blimp catching fire and falling onto the city. nature was also an enormous obstacle. wind would blow the blimp into surrounding buildings, and since it was floating in the air, weights couldn't keep it down. finally, there was an existing law stating aircraft could not fly too low around urban areas.
2 there were a lot of obstacles the builders of the empire state building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. for instance, they wanted to add more hight to the empire state building so it can be,  equipped for an age of transportation that was then only the dream of aviation dream  @person said. next, al smith wanted to add a mooring mast at the top of the empire state building so it can allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service, and to let passengers off and on.  over sixty thousand dollar's worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework.  then they,  designed a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from inside, with a stepped-back design that imitated the overall shape of the building itself.  also,  the rocket-shaped mast would have four wings at it's corners, of shiny aluminum, and would rise to a conical roof that would house the mooring arms . the roof had to be completed before the mask can take place. the greatest obstacle to the successful use of mooring mast was nature itself. in conclusion, those were the obstacles the builders of the empire state building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.
3 the task of allowing dirigibles to dock on the empire state building was met with many obstacles. the fist one to come into play was the support of the building. the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would greatly reduse the stability of the building. over sixty thousand dollars' went into modifications of the building's framework.another problem was the dirigibles themselfs. most dirigibles coming from outside of the united states were filled with hydrogen. as seen in the tragic hindenburg inncodent, hydrogen is highly flammable. the owners of the empire state building concluded that an accadent such as this would be even more devastaing over a densly populated area. after being faced with all these obstacles, the idea of dirigibles docking atop the empire state building was put to rest for the safety of the people.
3 the builders of the empire state building faced a lot of obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. a big problem with safety: most dirigibles from outside of the united states used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. another reason was when dirigibles moored in open landing fields, they could be weighted down in the back with lead weights, but using these at the empire state building would not work out due to the highly populated new york and dangling over pedestrians.another reason was the law against airships flying too low over urban areas. this law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even aproach the area. even if it could, there was worries that the dirigible would be punctured by other obstacles on surrounding buildings.
2 the obstacles that the builders faced are flying blimps too low in the area and making the empire state building taller than its actually supposed to be. like in @caps three al smith realized that he's in danger of losing his title for world's tallest building. on december @number @number he announced that the empire state building would reach a height of @number ft. all he had to do is add a top or a hat to the building and that would make it even taller than any other building in the city. anothe obstacle they faced was a law about airships flying too low above urban areas. they made this law so no airship would ever tie up with a building. flying too low is a huge safety hazard; it could take the lives of hundreds of people.
2 the @caps @caps  the mooring mast  by marcia amidon l sted, talks about the height of the buildings, the empire state building and the chrysler building. the architecture who built the chrysler building was secretly hiding something. the secret was that he constructed a @number spire inside the building, it shocked many people and the media by hoisting it up to the top of the chrysler building. now it's a height of @number feet, which is @number feet taller than the height of the empire state building. one obstacle to their expand use in new york city was the lack of a suitable landing area. al smith thought that a mooring mast added to the top of the building would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service to let passengers on and off. the mooring mast couldn't just simply drop a mooring mast on top or the building. adding a mooring mast to a cable tether could add stress to the buildings frame. they finally build the mooring mast and they raised the american flag again.
3 the obstacles the builders of the empire state building faced in attempting dirigibles to dock there include wind, weather, and especially safety issues. the excerpt states  the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents . this states that nature was a great obstacle for the plan of dirigibles to dock at the empire state building. the other largest obstacle was safety. the excerpt says,  most dirigibles from outside of the united states use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flamable.  another main safety concern was that the use of lead weights to anchor the dirigible was neither practical nor safe above the city of pedestrians.
2 in the @caps @caps  the mooring mast  by @organization, the builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles to allow dirigibles to dock there. one obstacle to their expanded use in new york city was the lack of a suitable landing area. another obstacle was getin the passengers on and off the dirigbles safley. in conclusion i have showend the obstacles that the builders have faced on the @organization.
2 the empire state building was built with great potential, but it would never reach it fully. the empire state building was supposed to reach @num feet, being just inches taller than the chrysler building, when the architect who designed the @caps building snuck up and stuck a @number foot pole on top. of course the empire state building had to be taller, so they set a new goal and reached @number feet on december @number @number al smith, @caps of new york and architect, decided that the empire state building needed a cherry on top, so he decided to put a mooring mast for zeppelins on top. this plan was destined for disaster: the foundation wasn't stable enough for zeppelins, they could easily be blown out of control and onto the sharp tip of the building, and also, since  zeppelins had hydrogen in them, they could explode and fall onto the densely populated @location. all in all, the mooring mast at the top of the empire state building was built for disaster
3 acording to the excerpt from the mooring mast by marcia amidon @caps the builders of the empire state building faced obsticles in attempting to attache a dirigible mooring unit to the top of the building. in paragraph @num, @caps says  the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself.  and then describes how harsh winds could render the mast unstable. another obsticle in the making of the mast was a law stating derigibles could not fly under a certain altitude, the set altitude was higher then the building was tall. the last obsticle was safety, in paragraph @num @caps talks about how some blimps are filled with hydrogen, which is highly flammable. the effect of a blimp fire over a vastly populated area would be devistating. the mooring mast on the empire state building was an ingeniose idea, but had to many obsticles to make it work.
3 as a result of the idea to build a mooring mast, the builder faced a few obstacles in construction the mast. the first problem was structural, the weight of the dirigible tied it with a single tie would put great stress on the building. it was said between the dirigible's load and wind pressure the stress would be distributed all the way to foundation of the building. another obstacle was the safety. many dirigibles outside the united states used hydrogen instead of helium which is highly flamable. the owners realized the  hindenburg  incident and realized the effects it could of had on downtown new york. the final obstacle was nature because the winds shifted at the top of the building. the problem discussed on this was despite the dirigibles being tied, it could swivel around the mast. the many obstacles faced led to the mooring mast not being constructed to its full purpose and blimps were less commodly used.
2 the builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles to allow dirigibles to dock there. for instance, in paragraph @num it talks about the hindenburg bursting into flames over new jersey + how much dangerous it would of been over a highly- populated areas such as new york.
2 the empire state building was built to compete with the chrysler building and to compete they created a mooring mast. the obstacles that restricted the dirigibles was: nature, the wind changes on top of the building were drastic, and some dirigibles had a large amount of hydrogen which is highly flammable. another reason why was because it's illegal for aircrafts to fly low over urban areas. the examples above were all complications that restricted the derigibles to moor at the empire state building.
4 in the building of the mast that was to be used to dock and refuel dirigibles the builders and arcitect @caps many daunting problems for one thing a simple mooring mast could not be placed on the roof of the empire state building. the mast would add to much stress to the buildings frame work and cause it to colapse, along with the imense wind power. another problem was that  most dirigibles from outside of the united states used hydrogen rather then helium to inflate there dirigibles. unlike helium, hydrogen is highly flammable. there was also a law that stated that airships could not @caps too low over urban areas one of the final and most important reasons builders @caps obstacles was the constantly shifting wind due to violent air current. even with the dirigibles tethered to the mooring mast the back end would swivel around the mast along with the wind.
3 from my reading, i understand that the difficulties of building a mooring dock atop such a structure as the empire state building were numerous. an obvious one was structural stability throughout the entire building. paraphrased from the passage, the tension from the dirigible pulling on the tether would cause stress on the building's frame. another was controll of the dirigible during docking. the passage explained that the winds above the empire state building would shift violently and frequently. safety as well as an issue, especially after the hindenburg accident in new jersey, when a german zeplin caught fire and exploded. 
1 the obstacles the builders faced building the empire state building were; the safety, the time.the safety of building the top the empire state building got in the way because, it was so tall that it would be hard to lift up the glass and steel parts to the top. another reason why it was unsafe because if some of the glass or steel part got pushed off the people down be low. another reason is the blinps flying to close to the buildings and hitting one of them. also the passengers going on and off of the blinp; they needed to find away that the passengers wouldn't get hurt.the time that they had to build the top of the empire state building was not long enough.  it's on the level, all right. no kidding. we're working on the thing now. 
1 to allow dirigibles to @caps on the empire state @caps builders would have to face tough obstacles. one obstacle would be that technology was growing in the @number by the time they were @caps with the @organization and planes were invented.  the as yet unsolved problem of mooring airships to a fixed mast at such a height made it desirable to postpone to a later date the finel installation of the landing gear.  this @caps proves that they already made technology to land dirigibles safely but, @caps to see if the mast really worked. this @caps that technology was invented @caps than the builders could even make the mast at the top of the empire state building. later on the figured that a dirigible would be unsafe at the top of a mast becuse the wind would blow it arond and crash into the building. it was @caps to begin with.
2 in the excerpt, the mooring mast by marcia amidon l sted, the empire state building faced some obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. to begin with, one of the greatest obstacle was the act of nature.  the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents , this made it hard for the dirigible to have a safer landing. the other obstacle was that there was a law, that went against airships flying low over urban areas. in conclusion, the mooring mast of the empire state building was not use for landing airship such as the dirigible because it was to dangireous. in addition, they used the mooring mast for other safe purpuses.
2 in the excerpt,  the mooring mast  by marcia amidon l sted, the builders went through obstacles to allow the dirigibles to dock in the @organization, the builders had to redesign the top of the empire state building. they had to make it taller and more suitable for the dirigibles to land. they went through problems because they were not sure if the dirigibles would fit. second, the had to design the mast. the builders had to design a whole other part for the dirigible. the builders also had to spend sixty thousand dollars into building the mast. the builders faced that big obstacle. third, the builders also made a stainless steel tower for the docking of the dirigibles. this was an obstacle because the had glass and chrome-nickel stainless steal on the tower. the builders went through many obstacles for the dirigibles to dock, when in the end the dirigibles never did get a chance to dock the builders should  take a bow, because it's over now 
3 the obstacles the builders of the empire state building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. the first, it says the building's foundation will be more stress with a thousand-foot dirigible docking. for example  a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame. the stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation.  the second, it says that it's really dangerous if they take place above the building. for example,  when the german dirigible hindenburg was destroyed by fire in lakehurst, new jersey, on may @number @number the owners of the empire state building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown new york.  @caps, it says the winds on the top of the building are so strong. for example  the winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast.  in conclusion, they still face to many obstacles, so the idea which let the dirigibles dock on the top of the building is hardly become true. 
3 in the excerpt  the mooring mast  by author @organization, the builders of the empire state building faced some obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. a first obstacle the builders faced was the concern of the building collapein over time with  all the weight of the dirigibles. they would have to spend more money and time to create a frame for the empire state building to support the dirigibles.  @caps @num supports that obstacle  a thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of the building would add stress to the buildings frame . a second obstacle builders of the empire state building came upon on attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the building was the concerns of the thousands of citizen just below the tall building. after german dirigible was on fire in jersey they realized how serious they situation can become.  owners of the empire state building realized how much worse it that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown new york.  these were two of the obstacles the builders of the empire state building faced.
2 obstacles the builders of the empire state building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, were not easy to overcome. most dirigible were massive, @caps by in this quote dealing with them was no easy task.  @caps as long as one thousand feet, the same length as four blocks in new york.  in this quote it tells of their massive size and proves how difficult it would be to control and land them safetly.another obstacle the workers had to face is modifying the already set structure of the empire state building, also money spent as @caps by in this quote.  the steel frame of the empire state building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation. over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the buildings framework.  this quote proves that the addition of the mooring mast would be not only tirering for the workers, but also alot of money would be spent on a failed project. they got their tall building, but were unable to achieve mooring mast.
1 in the excerpt  the mooring mast  by marcia amidon l sted the builders faced quite a few problems. they faced on constructing the building. they didn't know if they could built it all. they also faced a bad climate, and faced on how much did the dirigibles weighted and if they can hold it. on paragraph fourteen it says  dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weights.  these are a few things that the workers had to face
3 . the empire state building during it's construction was being planned to serve as a mast, in which dirigibles could be attached to. the builders of the building did not realize the severity of the obstacles preventing them from safely accomplishing this feat. most of the problems presented for the most part were concerning safety. due to safety issues the mast was considered to lucrative and idea, and posed too much of a danger. there were simply too many possible opportunities for something to go wrong. one of these issues was that dirigibles contain dangerous flamable gases, that if something went wrong a flamming dirible coming down on down town new york city would cause major damage. another obstacle preventing this idea from becoming reality was that the dirible tethered to the mast would be  constantly shifting due to the violent air currents (para @num). another reason why it couldn't be done  was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas  (para @num). all of the problems that could not be solved plausibly were the reason why, the mast was unrealistic.
2 based on  the mooring mast  there were several obstacles the builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. first of all, they couldn't just put a mast a top the building because it would put too much pressure on the building's frame. also the stress would be transmitted all the way to the foundation of the building, which was @number hundred feet below the mast. so before they could build anything, they had to re-inforce the entire structure of the empire state building. finally these obstacles were fixed, but those were the obstacles the builders fixed.
2 the first obstacle that the builders of the empire state faced was the lack of suitable landing area. the second obstacle that the builders of the empire state faced was that the architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on the top of the empire state building's flat roof. the greatest obstacle to the succesful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. the winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents.
3 the obstacles that the builders of the empire state building faced in attempting to allow the dirigibles to dock were very difficult. difficult. one difficulty that they had was that the mooring mast nature it self. when the dirigibles would come to the building, the winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air current, and the only way that they could moor is if the weighted down the back, and using them at the empire state building won't be practical or safe, with pedestrians below you.another obstacle that the builders had was an existing law. the law was against airships flying to low over urban areas. this law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building, or even approach the area. this was an obstacle because they didn't have much to do about this since it's a government thing holding them back.these are just some obstacles that the builders of the empire state building faced in attempting to allow the dirigibles to dock.
3 the builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles in the attempted to allow dirigibles to dock there,  the architect could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the empire state building's flat roof . a thousand-foot diriglble tethed by a single caple would add to much stress to the building's frame.  the stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation. if not the empire state building might fall over. for the empire state building to take the extra load the architect would have to modify and strengthen the building's existing framework. also the ornate mast would be difficult to raise on top of the empire state build due to the high winds.  the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents . if the dirigible was tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the dirigible would swivel around and around the mooring mast. if this happened the dirigible would crash into the empire state building or other building. this would be bad for the people on the street. where dirigible's usually land are in open fields. the dirigible could be weighted down in the back with a lead weight. but on top of the empire state building dangling weights above pedestrians was neither practical nor safe. also laws were passed restricting a dirigible from getting to close to a building.
4 in the excerpt mooring mast by marcia amidon l sted, the builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock their. one obstacle was, many modifications had to be made to the buildings framework. the dirigible's load and wind pressure would have to be transmitted to buildings foundation. another reason builders face many obstacles is, most dirigibles used hydrogen rather than helium. this would be very dangerous if a fire occured especilly in a highly populated area. another reason is due to violent air currents the back of a dirigible would swivel around the mooring mast. as it says on page @num, paragraph @num the dirigible would dangel above pedestrians on the street which isnt practical or safe. lastly, an existing law against airships flying to low over urban areas and it is illegal for dirigibles to tie up to the building or even approach the building. in conclusion builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock their.
3 the builders @caps many problems when attempting to build a dirigible dock on the empire state building which ranged from legal, to structural, to logistical problems. firstly there was a law in place which restricted airships from  flying too low over urban area's  as explained in paragraph @num. in addition to this legal problem, the builders @caps the structural problem of putting a mooring mast on top of a skyscraper. according to the article the stress of the dirigible load along with wind pressure would have to be transmited over eleven hundred feet to the foundation. because of this added weigh over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications were made to the building as cited in paragraph @num. also the logistics of docking a dirigible at such an altitude were quite challenging. in fact half of the attempted dirigible landings at the empire state building were aborted due to high winds. although a dirigible landing mast would have put the empire state building on the forefront of modern travel, it could not be done due to legal, structural and logistical problems.
3 the builders faced multiple obsticles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on top of the empire state building. if the thousand-foot dirigible tried to land on top of the empire state building, it  would add stress to the building's frame  (paragraph @num). the building would then have to be modified to meet these needs. nature played as a big obsticle, as well.  the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents  (paragraph @num). if the dirigible tried to land, the back of it would swivel around and around the landing zone, creating an unsafe enviroment. finally, the government also prevented dirigibles from docking on the building. there was,  an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas  (paragraph @num). these three main reasons prevented dirigibles from landing on top of the empire state building.
3 the empire state building faced hardships while trying to dock their dirigibles. the builders tried to build a docking station for the dirigibles, but the only problem they had was safely docking in thousands of feet in the air. the one obstacle to their expanded use in new york city was the lack of a suitable landing area. winds in new york would also make it difficult to land. another reason why dirigibles could not moor at the empire state building was the laws about airships flying too low over urban areas. not only was it illegal, but also unsafe. most dirigibles from out of the united states were made with a highly flammable gas called hydrogen. a german dirigible was destroyed by fire in lakehurst, new jersey. the owners of the empire state building relized how bad it could've been in a highly populated area such as new york.
3 although the mooring mast due to hoist at the top of the empire state building was a well thought out plan, it provided some obstacles for builders. the biggest problem was safety. most dirigibles used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is a highly flammable product. if an accident, such as fire, occurred at the empire state mooring mast it wouldn't be safe to take place around millions of people such as new york city. another factor affecting building was nature. the winds above were constantly shifting due to currents. the only way to tie down the dirigibles would be to use weights, but that would also be extremely unsafe to be hanging above a city of people. the last issue was an existing law that prevented airships from flying to low in urban areas. this law makes it illegal for ships to even attempt to tie to the building, therefore it made it nearly impossible for builders to work.
2 based on the excerpt there are three reason's why there were obstacles the builders of the empire state building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. these reason's were, one it was to close to the city and not high up (short). the second reason is because the wind spun the blimp around the mast. and the third reason is because german blimps were filled with hydrogen, if next to heat it would blow up. and @location blimps were filled with helium.
4 the builders of the @organization many obstacles. al smith realized that he was close to losing the title of the world's tallest building. the one obstacle to their expanded use in new york city was the lack of a suitable landing area. a mooring mast was added to the top of the building would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling. dirigibles were docked by means of an electric whinch. the architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the empire state building's flat roof. a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame. the steel frame of the empire state building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation. over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework. the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in back with lead weights. this law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area, all though two dirigibles did attempt to reach the building before the entire idea was dropped. fearing that the wind blow the dirigible onto
3 new york is said to be,  the city that never sleeps.  the people of new york are always awake, rushing about in the streets. when four-term governor, al smith, wanted  to put up a mooring mast on top of the empire state building, these people of new york had many concerns. along with the people whom were constructing the building. these concerns consisted of laws, saftey and construction.if a mooring mast was built, a law they'd have to worry about would be flying airships too low over urban areas. this law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up the building or even come close to the area. another major worry was safety. these dirigibles contained highly flammable hydrogen. if a dirigible had caught fire above new york city, the damage could be tragic. the construction of the mast was out of the question because they never had planned on making it prior to starting the projectoverall, the mooring mast on top of the empire state building was never really destined to have been created. too many factors and obstacles were in the way after the idea of creating the mooring mast began.
1 the obstacles the buildes of the empire state building faced were that they had to make it strong. also they had to be sure that the dirigibles wouldn't destroy the building when it landed. they also had to care ful that the dirigbles would crash in to the building when it was droping off the papers. an other obstacle for the workes was that the driagbles would not be able to land easily. finally, they would have to make sure that nothing is out of place and working.
3 the main obstacles that the builders of the empire state building had to face were mainly safety and nature itself. safety was most important, and because they were aiming at having dirigibles land on top of the building, they needed to make sure it was completely safe in the reading it states that  most dirigibles from outside of the united states used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is flameable.  @caps it is flameable, the builders realized how much danger it could cause especially in a high populated area like new york city. now besides safety, one of the biggest obstacles was nature. with having the mooring mask at a steep height on top of the empire state building came with many difficulties that revolved around the weather and atmosphere the winds on the top of the building were always shifting, which would make it hard to land dirigibles. because of the unsustainable air currents, nothing could be done about the dirigibles.  even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast.  due to the roughness of the wind and the unidealistic design of the dirigible, safety and nature were main obstacles in the creation of the empire state building.
3 the builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock there. the author stated,  the greatest reason was one of safety.  dirigibles used hydrogen more often than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. if a dirigible were to catch fire or crash, it would be very dangerous over a populated area.another obstacle was nature. the author wrote,  the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents.  the wind would be too much for a dirigible to handle.a final reason stating why they couldnt dock was because it was against the law. the story stated,  ... was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas.  this law made it illegal to dock.the dirigibles faced many obstacles that didnt allow them to dock at the empire state building.
3 there were many problems the builders of the empire state building faced when it came to dirigibles.they faced problems with  ... violent air currents  that flow above the building. these would constantly be pushing the ships as they tried to dock, and sway the back end while they were docked. another problem was that there was an  ... existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas.  this would make it basically illegal to dock an airship on the empire state building. these obstacles described in  the mooring mast  by marcia l sted show why the spire at the top of the empire state building was never used to dock dirigibles.
3 when the idea of a mooring dock for dirigibles first @caps about it seemed like a brilliant idea but as time and construction went on, the surmounting obstacles that arose made the idea of a mooring dock stayed just an idea. when the mooring mast was finished, the obvious safety hazards stopped it from fulfilling it purpose. the greatest @caps hazard was the nature of the mast itself. the winds at that height were strong, violent and constantly shifting. even if the dirigible was tethered down, the back of the ship would be swireled around the mooring mast.another hazard was that most dirigiples from outside the united states used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is extremely flammable. after the german dirigible hindenburg was destroyed by fire in @number the owners of the empire state building realized that they could not take that @caps. a final obstacle that arose was a law that was against airships flying too low over urban areas. this law made it illegal for a ship to even come near the building.
3 there were many obstacles the builders of the empire state building faced in an attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there in the @num.the first obstacle was  the architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the empire state building's flat roof.  if the builders had decided to that than the dirigible moored at the top of the building would add stress to the building's frame which could also jeopardize the lives of all the tourists who visited and everyone who worked there.there was also the fact that  the stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below.  which meant the frame of the empire state building would have to be modified and strengthened, something like that didn't come cheap, in fact  over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework. in all the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock at the empire state building was a failure. the most obvious being safety since most dirigibles outside the united states used hydrogen instead of helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. the end result is, today the rooms that were set aside for baggage are now the world's highest soda fountain and tea garden. and the highest observation deck has never been open to the public.
3 the builders of the empire state building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.  one obstacle that faced the builders was that the dirigibles could not simply land on top of the building.  the thousand foot dirigible would add stress to the frame of the building.  they would have to  transmit  the load and the wind pressure to the foundation which was nearly eleven hundred feet below.  the builders had to make over @money worth of modifications.  another reason was nature.  as stated in paragraph @num,  the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting .  the dirigible could not be teathered down because the lead weights would be dangling above pedestrians.  a final obstacle was an already existing law.  the law was against airships flying too low over urban areas.  this made it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building.  these obstacles destined the mooring mast to never fulfill its purpose.
4 based on the excerpt, the mooring mast, by marcia amidon l sted, building a mooring mast on the empire state building was hindered by many obstacles the builders had to face. firstly, the stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would hurt the building's frame. builders fix this problem by making  over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications... to the building's framework  (page @num paragraph @num). after the mast's construction, two more obstacles arose. firstly, most dirigibles used hydrogen, which is very flammable. after the german dirigible hindenburg was destroyed by fire, the builders realize the danger in letting that same accident happen in densely populated new york city. the mast's greatest obstacle was  nature itself . since the winds on top of the building were away shifting due to air currents, the back of the dirigible would swivel around the mast. builders thought of using lead weights to fix this problem, but dangling weights high above pedestrians on the street  was neither practical nor safe . the last and most obvious obstacle was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. though the builders and owners were able to overcome the first obstacle given from the construction of the mooring mast on the empire state building, future obstacles prevented the mooring mast from fulfilling its purpose.
2 the people who built the empire state building had many problems building it. the one obstacle to their expanded use in new york was the of a suitable landing area. the empire state building was going to have a mooring mast at it's top for docking these new airships, which would accommodate passengers on already existing transatlantic routes and new routes that were yet to come.
3 in the excerpt from,  the @caps mast , by marcia amidon l sted, it was mentioned that architects faced challenges when attempting when allowing dirigibles to dock on the empire state building one obstical they faced was the fact that they used hydrogen instead of helium. in the excerpt it said that hydrogen is highly flammable @caps if something went wrong it could be a huge problem in a highly populated area like new york. the main problem they faced was the nature itall. it said  the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents  the dirigible has the potential to swivle around the mast and with all the pedestrians below that is very dangerous. these challenges are what led to the fate of the mooring mast not being used as originaly planned
3 in the mooring mast, by marcia amidon l sted, the builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. the mast was doomed to fail before it began. the greatest reason the mast never worked was because of safety. the hydrogen, in most dirigibles, is highly flammable. if an accident were to occur, it would happen over down town new york.  the owners of the empire state building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it taken place above a densely populated area.  (@caps @num) nature itself was one of the greatest obstacles to the successful use of the mast. violent air currents and horse winds made it difficult to fly a dirigible near the building.  the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents.  (@caps @num) the mooring mast was doomed to fail before they began building it. the greatest reasons for its failure were air currents and safety. the dirigibles were never able to land there.
1 the construction workers faced many obstacles in building the empire state building. one of those obstacles was hieght. since they wanted to make the building the tallest building in the world they had to make sure there was enough technology to do so. also they had to add an extra seventeen flores to the building making it @number floors instead of its original @num floors. another obstacle was its safety issues. the construction workers never checked into problems with building the mooring mast. in paragraph @num the author states,  the as yet unsolved problems of mooring air ships to afixed mass at such a height made it describable to post pone to a later date the final installation of the landing gear.  the author is trying to say that when designing the production of the mooring mass;  they overlooked certain issues that make them set back the final date. due to these obstacles, the construction team managed to succeed in building the tallest building, the empire state building.
2 the greatest reason was one of safty: most dirigibles from outside of the united states used hydrogen rather than helium and hydrogen is highly flammable. the greatest obstacle use of the mooring mast was nature itself. the on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violen air currents
3 the mooring mast by @organization, the builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles in the attempts of allowing dirigibles, the transportation of the future in the @date's, also known as blimps to dock at the building. the biggest problem was figuring out how to make the mast work.the main obstacle to the use of the mooring mast was nature, since the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting because of strong, violent air currents, the back of the dirigible would turn around and around the mast even when it'll be tied to the mast. it is said in the excerpt that dirigibles moored in open landing fields can be weighted down with the use of lead weights. because these would be dangling high above people below it would be dangerous, just in case it falls. also, builders cannot control nature making this the most difficult.another obstacle was the stress the body frame at the building will receive if the dirigible was held by a single cable tether. the wind pressure and stress would have been too much for the building's foundation. this was solved by modifying the steel frame of the building to be stronger to keep the building from collapsing.the attempts at allowing dirigibles to more at the building had many obstacles but in the end it was all for nothing because there is a law that is against airships flying too low over urban areas.
3 in the excerpt from  the mooring mast , the builders of the empire state building were faced with  obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. the designers had such big plans for the building that reality was far off. one challenged they encountered was the safety of everyone. in the excerpt they talk about how,  most dirigibles from outside of the united states used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable  (paragraph @num). the risk of the dirigible being caught on fire was very high. if it did catch on fire not only would it harm the blimp, but also the buildings and people of new york. another obstacle that was in the way was mother nature herself. no one could predict the weather, and  the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents  (paragraph @num). blimps would not be able to fly close enough without the wind pushing it. the winds could make the aircraft fly into buildings, which could damage the design of the dirigible. all in all, the challenges the designers had to build such a great building, were only a practical dream that reality soon crushed.
3 in the mooring mast by @organization, the builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles to allow dirigibles to dock there. one big obstacle they had to overcome is when the dirigibles dock it would leave stress on the foundation of the building.  over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the buildings framework.  another obstacle the builders would have to overcome was the winds at the top of the building constantly shifting directions. they thought about putting weights on the dirigibles but then that would not be safe having them hang a thousand feet up over people. there was also a law stating that airships could not fly too low over urban areas. therefore the builders of the empire state building had many obstacles to overcome.
2 while in the process of building the empire state building the workers overcome countless obstacles. al smith, the governor of new york, wants to build  the world's tallest building  (@number at the same time the empire state building is being designer the @organization building, also in new york, is finishing construction the @organization building workers decide they want to challenge the designers of the empire state building by secretly building a @number spire and making their building @number feet taller. this begins a competition between the designers to see who will win the title of the tallest building. later on, after the empire state building is built and wins the title of the tallest building, the workers are trying to make it work as a mast for dirigibles the land on. the designers forgot to factor in the safety of landing a dirigible in the middle of a city and the fact that wind is a huge factor in landing the aircraft safely. the idea of the building for acting as a landing for dirigibles is dropped. the empire state building *************** 
4 many problems arised with the docking of dirigibles at the empire state building for that the engineers did not account. while the architects were designing the mast, they realized that the building was not built to withstand the stress of dirigibles and the wind.  ... modifications had to be made  (paragraph @num). though this obstacles was able to be overcome, many others were not. since most dirigibles outside of the @person used hydrogen, a very flammable gas, a dirigibles could go down in flames similar to the german hindenburg, and  owners... realized how much worse that accident could have been... above... new york  (paragraph @num). another obstacle was a problem with a  law against airships flying too low over urban areas  (paragraph @num). no dirigible would be allowed even close to the building; however, two still tried but neither could tether safely to the building. the thought of the transportation of the future moved on to airplanes and the empire state building's top floors are now a public tourist spot.
3 the obstacles the builders of the empire state building faced were that first, the mast designed to go ontop of the empire state building was thought up just to make it the worlds tallest building, not because it was necessary, so alot of problems ar ose. this mast was designed to be a dirigible docking station, which, at the time, blimps were very unsafe, and  lacked a suitable landing area so this was thought to be a great opportunity to give them a place anchor for a few hours for refueling, service, and to let passengers on and off. a mooring mast couldn't be simply dropped on top, as it would add stress to the building's frame, so the steel frame had to be modified, and took over sixty thousand dollars' to do so. after construction took place, it was then decided if an incident, such as the hindenburg occurred again, it would be much worse over a densely populated area such as downtown new york. but the largest obstacle was nature itself, the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting, due to violent air currents, and although tethered to the mast, the back of the ship would swivel around, the usage of lead weights could solve this problem, but because they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, it was neither practical nor safe. there was also an existing law against air ships flying too low over urban areas.
4 architects based in new york tried very hard to build a successful mooring mast on top of the empire state building, to dock dirigibles for several hours for refueling or service purposes and to allow passengers on and off the blimp. while building, architects faced some challenging obstacles that destroyed the chances of the mooring mast to open and become usable. a dirigible moored at the top of the empire state building only held by one cable tether would cause tension on the building's frame. the weight and wind pressure would need to be transferred to the buildings foundation. about over @money of modifications would need to be made to the buildings framework. another obstacle was the roof.  when the building had been framed to the @number floor, the roof had to be completed before the framing for the mooring mast could take place,  wrote @person in her article 'the mooring mast.' the greatest obstacle however was nature itself. violent air currents caused the winds to change nonstop causeing the blimp to swivel around the mooring mast. the only solution would be to weigh down the back of the craft with lead weights, but the risk was to much. last but not least there was a line new york against airships flying to low over urban areas. the law made it illegal for a blimp to even approach the empire state building. as a result of not being able to use the mooring mast for dirigibles to station, the rooms set aside were turned into the world's highest soda fountain and a tea garden for tourist and sightseers. by the late @number dirigibles had become transportation of the past, and airplanes had made their way to the front of the crowd.
4 the builders of the empire state building were @caps with immediate problems when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. the media hardship that they @caps was placing a mooring mast on top of an already completed building.  a thousand foot dirigible... would add stress to the building's frame.  (  @num) not to mention that a large dirigible would also have placed stress on the building. completing such a project would be extremely difficult because the building was not designed for docking dirigibles. this means the roof and the top floors would need to be converted to accommodate passengers and travel operations. nature was also an obstacle that builders @caps. high winds could cause the dirigible to violently sway. weights used to tether the dirigibles could also be a safety hazard in a densley populated area such as @location. fire was another safety concern for the builders. the gases used to keep the dirigibles airborne were highly flammable and would again cause serious concern for safety in a city of millions. ultimately all of these factors caused the creation of a mooring mast on the empire state building to fail.
3 after reading the mooring mast, by marcia amidon l sted, the obstacles the builders of the empire state building are faced with in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there are evident. the number one reason is because it is not safe. first, most dirigibles used hydrogen, which is highly flamable. the chance of a fire starting is especially not good because its a highly populated area. also,  the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself  ( @num). with the building being so high,  winds were constantly shifting due to violent air currents  ( @num). the conclusion has been made the dirigibles land in landing fields because they can be weighted down in the back with lead weights. this method would not be safe if used on the empire state building. clearly, the builders of the empire state building are faced with too many obstacles to allow dirigibles to dock there.
2 the obstacles the builders of the empire state building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building. because it was held by a single cable tether that would add stress to the buildings frame. another obstacle was that dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. even though, the steel frame of the empire state building had to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation. overall, this cost over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications.
1 based on the excerpt  the mooring mast  by marcia amidon l sted, the builders of the empire state building faced a few obstacles. one of those obstacles was making sure that blimps and other air born transportations didnt interfer with the building. also another obstacle the builders had to deal with was making sure the docking areas were safe. because if a blimp go to close to an urban city like @caps.y and have all thos flamable fuels leak out. it would be a big disaster. these are the obstacles the builders faced.
1 the @caps says the greatest obstacle would be nature itself. the wind would blow the blimps on to the sharp spires of other buildings.
3 there were many obstacles the builder of the empire state building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. first off as stated in para graph @num,  a thousand-foot drigible moored at the top of the building... would add stress to the buildings frame.  this shows an obstacle because in order to enable this to happen, over @money of funds would be needed. the funds leading to the stregthing and modification of the steel frame. thus needing to redo the fundamental building blocks of the operation. second the greatest concern was safety. this is brought to hand because most drigibles are very flammable. they consist of helium, which is a extremly flammable gas. also if the drigible were to mount to the top of the empire state building, the back of it would be swaying around and around. this possibly having a chance of dis-mounting and it crashing into a densly populated area of people. these are some reasons that the obstacles of attempting to allow drigibles to dock on the top of the empire state building.
3 the builders of the empire state building faced obstacles such as safety, nature, and law in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. the issue of safety became apparent because most dirigibles made outside of the @location were made with highly flammable hydrogen rather than helium. to risk the destruction of one atop such a bustling city would be devastating. nature too became a problem in the futile attempt of the builders. with such  violent air currents  (  @num), the dirigible would swivel around even if it were tied up to the mooring mast. finally, law was an obstacle to the builders. existing legislation banned airships from  flying too low over urban areas  (  @num), meaning the dirigibles would have no way of landing atop the urban building. obstacles such as safety, nature, and law hindered be attempt of allowing dirigibles to land on the empire state building.
2 the builders of the empire state building were faced with many obstacles. allowing dirigibles to dock on the mast would be too complex, which the builders did not realize at first. the most complex obstacle was how the builders were going to securely tie the blimp down without it not only spinning around, but from ripping the building out of its foundation. the constructors also had to worry about if it was safe or not and if it was permitted. another major obstacle was that not only were the dirigibles too low to the ground to dock, but they were mostly made up of hydrogen instead of helium, which was very flammable. after all the hard work to be successful. al smith and his peers had to look out for the best interests of the people of new york.
10 i think patience is a time when you have to be calm. it is also a time of wateing. for some people being patient is extremely hard. but for me it s easy. at times i can be inpatient, but everyone can be. being patient is kinda new racking, but i manage. a lot of times i get mad if i have to be too patient. i think @percent of people in the world don t like to be patient. with patience comes a reward is you are really patient!
19 one nice sunny day i was traped in a doctors office with no air conditioning. this doctor s office had @num chairs in the dirty waiting room. i was already cramed in the room with about @num people for @num minutes. i was trying to be patient but the patience was wearing off. sweat dripped of of my face on to my black @person short-@caps shirt. i was starting to get hot and mad, but i kept my patience. i know if i was going to get mad even more, it wouldnt help or make the time faster. then all of a sudden,  creeeeeck,  the door opened. a tall white woman with green schrubs on said,  @caps. 
24 a time that i was patient was last year at cheer competition. in the beginning of the day i was patient getting in line to get ready to perform. once we were ready we were waiting to go to perform. after, we perfomed we went to watch the rest of the teams. the other teams were really good. then are team went and had lunch while some of the teams were still performing. we had to wait til all the teams were done. once the teams were done they called all the squads to the mat it was award time. all the teams sat down on the mat. my team members were waiting patiently to see if we worn in cheer or in dance. we waited  and waited  and waited till finally he called are name. the junior varsity cheer leader! we took first in dance and fourth in cheer. that day was a good day for me and i was very patient and being patient can turn out right or not the way you wanted it to be. you never now till it happens. that is a time when i was patient at cheer competition.
16 i am not a patient person at all. but sometimes i have to be like my birthday for instance, i would love it if my birthday came at least every month. but of course, i only have @num birthday a year, so i have to wait. i would like to be a patient person. it s just not in the cards for me. my father on the other hand is more patient than anyone. i know he will tell me to clean the car @date i told him i didn t do it yet so he says he will give me more time. i couldn t be that patient with my kids. i would tell them to clean it now or they would be grounded. i wouldn t force them to or anything but i m not gonna wait a whole month before i get my car cleaned! i guess i could try to be as patient with my father but that would be really hard. although if i m  patient,  i m sure i will be able to do it!
20 it was my first camping trip! well, we went camping when i was one but i don t remenber a lot. i was super excited! so, i m sorry if i could nt help but wonder @caps the ? are we going! my patience was not very good. while i was waiting for my dad to hook the camper up to his truck i sat there very bored. i kept saying when are you going to be done? or,when are we leaving? everytime i got, just be patient hunny. so, i tried it wasn t really working.we finally left, it was an hour drive and when your seven thats a very long time. i had nothing to do, i was bored out of my mind! so, i said  daddy when are we gonna be there?  i got later, just be patient. so i followed demands and went along with his idea. once we got there the first thing i wanted to do was swim. so as my mom was getting her swimsut  on. i was so impatient i looked like i had ants in my pots. i was going to go knock of the bathroom door but, i didn t i took what i had learnt earier and did it. i sat down and patiently waited for my mom. so throughout this i learned a big lesson on patience. if you are patient things will happen much faster. i still use this lesson today. but every one in a while everyone is a little impatient.
17 i know i can i said to myself as i was getting ready to do a back walkover for the first time by myself. i bent backwards tried kicking over and feel! errg! i stood back up and asked @person my coach,  @caps my shoulders right?  @caps @caps your shoulder the kick over.  @caps got it  i said. as i bent backwards again i slowly raised my left leg to kick over, then i pushed my shoulders forward and i did it! i finally did it by myself! later that night i showed my mom i could do it. so i did the same exact thing i did at practice. i did it again! but this time at home. the look on my mom face could never be replaced @caps was so proud of me. then i @caps ran over and gave me a high five, then a big bear hug! so i said  thank you for being so patient.  @caps said  @caps for you baby. 
12 i have been patient lots of time at the @organization. @caps @caps, @caps sister, @caps brother, and @caps mom and dad we all had to wait on the @organization to get all of the shots ready for @caps brethe, sister, and me. @caps took forever at about two hours for the @organization to get the shots ready to be used end paragraph start @caps. one time me and @caps dad had to wait an hour to two hours that way i could sign up for football. we had to wait to weigh get the @person size helmet and pat s, we also had to wait for @caps pad punts and @caps mouth gairfi @caps dad and i one time had to wait a long time in duannm s because @caps mom bought @caps dad a @num gun. @caps dad had to set the gun put in his name end paragraph start @num. for basket ball sign up when  i lived  in @caps pleasant @caps took a long time to sign up for basket ball  because we had to get @caps number put on the @person size of shirt for me and @caps last name i also had to get basket ball short s @caps size. when i player soccer for the @person soccer team. @caps took one-hour because there was so many kind s that wanted to play soccer like @caps, @person, @person, @caps and me. when @caps mom took me to the sign up s year @caps took almost three hours @caps to sign up and set picture s taken end paragraph @num. every school day @caps friends and i wait like twenty @num thirty mines @caps to get a lunch or a kecreoml soriss roles ,zebra cars ,or gaanola  bars. @caps takes alons time before we can @num out site to play football, soccer, volleyball, and kick ball. the end
10 patience. i was patience when i had to baby sit. i rock him and play with him. i fed him, and walk him. he fell to sleep. my mom still is not home from work. i am going to be late to the movise with my cuzins. i play the game for @caps. i look out the window walk out side and sat on the steps.mom still not there. my cuzins were out side.  ask that to stay a little on gen. now hear came mom .i can go now.
14 i am writing about a time when i was patient. me myself @caps not a patient person. one time i had no choice but to be patient because my mother made me. we were waiting on the bus to come but i was very angry because it seemed like it took forever to come. so my mother said  @caps stop complanning and be patient @caps serious!  so as soon as i sat down the bus came!
11 patience perso is someone that deal with difficulties without complaining. like when your waiting in the docters office fora checkup. or in the eye doctors maybe a dentist. when your in the doctors office it all quiet then there a phone ringing! then the doctor walks in or dentist all there is is waiting and waiting.
16 when i was in third grade i hoped one of my friends who had some disabilities but i had to learn to be patient with him. when it comes to dedating with someone like him patience plays a great part in friend ship with him. ever though he had his days i would say to my self ''you have him and have patience '' and to this day him and i are still friends.
17 one day i was at home and i was getting ready to go and to eat and there was a very long  line so i was on the phone with @location and @person we were talking about the @caps test so then i said @caps why is this taking forever so they told me to be patient and until it s time to order, so i said what does patient means they said it means to understand and be tolerant and do not complain so i said i might try that and then before i knew it i was sitting at a table eating and on the phone at red hobster. so now i know whenever i go somewhere with long lines all i have to do is be a lot more patient and dont complaine.
9 this is a story about one time i when my mom was patient. one time me and my mom was at the clinic ?? to get my medicin. we where one of the first people there. then a lot more people started to come. my mom thought we where the first people to get called we weren t @num groups where called then @num more groups got called. @num more groups got called. then me and my mom finally got called and that was story of the time when my mom was patient.
24 patience is something that people don't have sometimes. i know i did once. and i 'm gonna tell you about it. it was a bright sunny day. all my family members were outside. my dad making hot dogs and hamburgers in the grill. my mom setting up the table. and me and my sibling playing catch with a football. all of us knew how to throw and catch a football but not my little brother. considering the fact that all of us were chose to teach my little brother. we tried once, we tried twice, but he just wouldn't get the hang of it. finally all my sisters got tired of explaining him the object of the game, so they gave up. me, on the other side said it over and over until he understood it. i myself got tired of telling him over and what to do. but then i thought 'hey give the kid a chance he might just get it 'so i just kept on helping him.  @caps is ready! come inside , my mom had called out.  time for @caps lets go inside  i said to my little brother.  @caps! just one last time, i promise i will get it!  he exclaimed.  @caps, but just one time  i responded. even tho he had been saying that the past few hundred times he'd tried, i thought it wouldn't hurt to do it once more. as i released the ball from hands my brother ran up to it and caught it! after he caught it he shouted  i did it  and i looked at him proudly and said  good job  he ran inside to tell my parents that he finally caught it. i was really alod that i had token the time to help him. i knew he could do it @caps matter how many times i tried or he tried. i knew he would get it soon. and he did! and that was the time i was patient.
17 there have been times in my life where i had to be patient. my friends and i that day had decided to go to @location @caps. i love roller coasters, but i hate the lines that come with. when we got there we had to wait a half an hour to get in. when we made the decision to go on the @caps ride first. next, we had to wait another @num minutes to get on the ride. other rides we want on too had a long wait. so throughout the day there was quite a bit of waiting. even when we got food we had to wait with all this waiting it took a lot of patience. my friend and i had to be understanding and tolerant of the waiting and long lines. by the end of the day all of us had gotten used to using our patience. that trip to @location @caps taught me to be a more patient person.

12 i was patient when i had to witch @num little bad girls at my sisters house. my sister asked if i wanted to spend the @time. i did then her god kids came over. that @time sister rembend she had to go some were. so that morning she left me with the kids for @num hours. so i had to wait patiently for her to come back. finaly she did.
24 have you ever had to be patient? i had to be patient when my older brother broke his finger. this happened at his friends house on a trapoline one hot @date day. when my brother broke his finger it seemed like  he was @person. my mom wanted to see his hand and his knuckles and all that stuff that moms always  do. it seemed like it took so long to ask my mom a question if she was in the same room as my brother. my mom called the doctor's office during the third day of the accident and got an apointment  for my brother. i thought okay what ever i'll stay at home while he goes to the doctor but  there was one person in the way of that and her is mom. she said that i had to go to the doctor with her and my brother even though i didn't want to. after that day i kept selling my mom excuses why i couldn't go but she wasn't buying them. so after a very short car ride that seemed to be a long car ride of torture, we were in the waiting room waiting. in that waiting room we were waiting, waiting, waiting and guess what else if you said waiting then you are right. in the waiting second got confused with minutes and minute got confused with hours. those ''hours'' of torture made the car ride look like a kitty ride. there was no entertainment of anything that could distract those cruel minutes from going so slow. if have ever soon a snail go imagine that six times slower and you'll start to understand how slow the time went by. finally after all of the time we've been waiting the doctor comes in the room and asks for my brother. the only problem with the doctor is that she is even more boring. the doctor sat and talked forever using word so long it make the @caps look small. i was so tired that i stoped caring. finally i was time to go hot no one was happy except for me. i was so happy to leave the doctor. let's review. i had to be patient when my brother broke his finger. my brother turned into @person and had to go to doctor. the doctor's office was exstremely boring. i was patient and finally i got to leave the doctors office. some times being patient has rewards.  my reward was being able to leave the doctor's office.
13 one time i was patient??? was my dad was going to sent me a @caps present. i was just waiting and waiting for it. while i was waiting i just and my??? day i sleep, are, play games invites class a lot, and watch tv, after two week i only got it, it was @organization dangs game and one houndred dolar, i call my dad and said, thank you after he played my game all night and save my hundred dollar until my birthday. that was the time i was patint
17 there was only @num minutes of class left and i had @caps to do. so i watched the clock tick down over so slowly. @num minutes left @num @num at @num, the teacher asked,  what are you doing?  i said,  @caps. i have @caps to do   why don t you put your headdown?  i was losing my patience and was going to snap, but didn t. i put my head down and next thing i know, its time to go. i kept my patience and didn t get in trouble.
7 i am always patient with my family, my mom and @caps do a lot of me and fan always patient if they take some where. sometimes, for hockey my mom and @caps take me. hockey. my @caps usally takes but on @date my mom takes me and i patient. for homework, i am always patient, if i go to @person s golfland my mom, saids she will take and i m always patient.
18 write in your own say about patience. @person and his mom are on their way to @caps @caps @caps. @person been waiting his whole life to go there. bill s mom gets a call from cousins, @person, bob and @person, his cousins ask can they go? @person s mom say sure. @person is patient boy so he just lets it go. still patient. once @person s mom gets his cousins, his mom gets another call from his five friends. they all ask the same question his cousins ask. his mom says yes.they each live in a different place far apart, so it will take twenty minutes to get to each house. finaly there. @person is so mad but is still patient.when his mom gets another call @person says who is it now !?! its his dad calling to say. i m at the @caps with @person s brother and sister, where are you? @person s mom responded, i palling in now @caps is my story about patients.
19 have you ever been patient?  i have and i have to say it was rewarding. i was sitting in the waiting room at the @organization s @caps @caps.  i planned to got my @caps washed, deep-condioned, and flat-ironed. the lady at the front desk called me up.  i m sorry but @person won t be here today.  @caps there anyone else that you d like to do your @caps?  a perplexed expression spread across my face.  @caps @caps here?  i asked.  yes, but she has a client right now. she can take you tomorrow at three o clock.  she suggested.  that s fine.   i said.  my feelings  were  kind of  upset, but that  all  changed  when i  walked outside.  it was raining. so i guess it was a good thing that i didn t get my @caps done. it was a good thing that i was patient. being patient has it s advantages.
21 patience is not a natural thing, it's something you have to learn. taking a three hour carride is a perfect example of patience. exactly like what i experienced. as we packed our suitcases for @caps city, i @caps't contain myself. i was already packed up but mom and dad were standing.  @caps you please finish packing see i really want to go!  , i exclaimed  you'll just have to wait a minute,  do ?? but i @caps't wait, so i grabed??, threw them in the trunk of our car, and walked to our kitchen to finish reading a book while they packed. after they finished cooking dad was carrying the last of the bags @caps their bedroom to the complain he notice me, setting patiently at the look. he thanked me, saying  @caps for being so patient, and just for that, mom and have surprise. for you. he set down the sultans, and briskly walked over to a white plastic had the suddenly pulled at a rectangular favor it was the some in the @caps @caps?????? it wash ? you????????. kind you so much man     ? replied. this just goes to show that prince really says off. only if you don't complain of course. !
16 i have used patience a lot of times but i think the most patience i ve had was hunting. you just have to sit there not talk and stay still. i was hunting out behind my house with my uncle @person and we got out there at six-o-clock am and the waited there until nine o clock at night. the dear finally started to come in and one dear got close enough for me to shoot. i drew my bow and shot at it but it was so dark i could hardly see and i missed it. my uncle didn t even see it until the last second and when i pulled the trigger of the release i knew straight away that it was going to miss. all you could hear was the dear running away and the arrow crashing through all the leaves. so later that nigh we went home really hungry.
17 have you ever had tot waiting @num hour line? this is what it was like for me and @caps. we were at ceder point waiting to ride too thrill dragster. we had just got there the first thing we decided to do was ride the top thrill dragseter but the line was about a three hour wait we went anyway.  we had just fineshed our first hour of waiting but it felt like three. i knew i had to be patient and relaxe but it just felt like forever. after anthor hour my stomach started to growl i checked my watch it was @num we had got here at @num i was starving and tiered but i stayed finaly an hour later it was our turn when i got off i knew it had been worth it to be patient. in conclusion i learned that patience is something you half to have for a lot of thing in life.
18 one time when i had to be patient was when i went to my first nascar race. i had to be patient because there wer a lot of people there on i didn t want to get last. an i had to wait till the people who were in front got in their seats. second- we finally got our seats an i had to sit by this scary person he was weird so the race was beginning an you could tell because the racers were getting into there cars. the jets went over us and the @organization was going. then the racers were off to race. finally the race a starts on my favorite racer is in the lead (@person). the cars were going so fast around like you could feel the bleachers shake. it was a fun exsperense but you had stay close is listen and be patient.
18 two years ago, when the first @caps came out my step dad paid eight hundred dollars for one. he was so happy all he did was brag to his family and friends about it. during this time my mom had broke her phone and my step dad did not want to let her use his hone. so she was phoneless for aleast three months. she was kind a mad but it was worth being patient for. as the newer and improved one came out in stores my mom was able to buy it. she was so glad, she had more apps then the first @caps and a webcom. i think that my mom did a good job at being patient because if it was someone else they wouldn t be able to wait that long.
13 when dealing with todlers or the elderly you must have patience. this patience is key when dealing with anyone, but very young and very old need more. elderly often @month become confused, have a hard time hearing you, or just be a bit slower than you. you must practice patience and give them respect. very young children are confused sometimes too because they are just learning. toddlers will often become upset and refuse to do what you tell them to is you have no patience with them and start to yell, patience is also important for mentally or physically challenged persons. if they are challenged, there is no way that they can help it. mentally challenged people often don't understand or don't want to do things just like toddlers. be patient with the physically challenged because some tasks @month be hard for them to complete. be patient with everyone because patience is respect. fear is not respect. that is how i feel about the word patience.
14 do you ever like waiting in the line at the store? well, i don t also ??? well i am going to tell you about a time when i was inpatient and patient. every morning i have to take the bus to school. i usually get in the bus stop @num min early, so i can talk with my mother ??? try i got up to early. i made it to the bus stop early. ??? @num min later i decided to go back home. by the time i got home i was going to be late. i hurried at the door, but i was too late, the bus was gone. i should have more patient. on day i was going to burger ??? was to get a hamburger with bacon cheese and toaster. when i got their, their where about @num peace in their, so i decided to wait my turn in line like i had later. i was there people payed from cash regester. i was finally their i ordered my burger when i was done it was worth the wait. in conclusion you have to be patient in everything you do. sports, school or home and even in public, i hope my story made you relise how important it is to be patient.
13 one time in @date, i was taking a test called the @organization (@caps). me, and my friends get down with the @organization early. so we had to be patient too. we had alot that we could do, but the choices were limited. being patient is hard, sometimes it feels like ages have gone by, but really @num minutes have gone by, sometimes patience requiers a lot of mental peace. one time me, and my dad were going to work in @location. the bus was late @num minutes, but it felt like a few weeks. sometimes patience is good and bad. good patience is when a team scores a goal, the audience was patient enough so that the team could score a goal. a bad patience is when you re late to work, and traffic, or the bus was late, or you could wait. sometimes you can distract yourselves while being patient, texting, calling a friend, or talking or playing a game, with a kid or with yourselves. so you see that patience can be good or bad, also requiers a lot of mental peace. @organization.
21 one time my brother @person was patient. patience is being understanding and lisksent through difficultis without complaining. our family lived in @location and were going to cedar point on vacation. we had fun all day end at @num we went on @organization. @person went on the blue @organization while the rest of the family went on the red. the blue keeps you up at the top for @num and drops you while the red one shoots you up to @num feet. the line for the red @organization was shorter than the blue one so we got to go on first. once the ride was over @person was already at the top of the blue @organization. we heard a loud sound that ment the blue @organization cast was coming down. but the blue cast wasn t coming down. @person was stuck at the top, @num feet in the air. @person got a bird s eye  of the park. i would have been scared if i were @person. at @num the ride lights came on and the cast plummed down. finally,, he got a ride. each ride got free season passes to cedar point. this is a time when @person needed to show patience.
21 one time i was patient was when i was at basketball practice. it didn t happen until the end. no one knew that this was going to happen. it just happened out of nowhere. i hit the wall. i had an accident. we were running suicides. i was running to fast and i couldn t stop. i went head-first  into the wall. it was a brick wall too. i didn t panic because i knew i had to be patient. i had to wait on a lot of things. i had to wait on an ambulance, which took a long time. i had to wait on a doctor to give me stitches which didn t take long. lastly i had to wait on the doctor to give me the discharge papers. it happened here at @organization . we were in the gym for basketball practice. it was in the @date but i cant remember the exact date. i was also in the sixth grade. it happened because i couldn t stop in time. when i hit my head it didn t hurt. when i got my stitches some parts hurted. when they took them out it didn t hurt. but i had massive headache. i was glad when everything was over.
21 we were driving to @location. my uncle lived there so since he always came to our house we were going to his new house. i was excited about going there, but there was one problem, it was over a ten hour drive. my parents woke me up the morning we were leaving and i felt so tired. i looked at the clock and it said six thirty a.m. i knew we weren't bringing a lot of food and things so we went to get packed up and in the van but it took longer that it seemed like it would last. my dad said we would leave around seven thirty but it was an hour more that we planned. we got all packed up and we were onthe road. it was about an hour in i fell asleep in the back seat. we made a stop an hour and @date and i woke up. after we got back me and my bother watched a movie on our portable dvd player. we kept driving there and i knew it would take a while but i kept my patience and fell asleep most of the time. when we got there @date it was great. their house was up in a mountain, i had fan visiting them and we walked around town went into stores.  i had fun seeing my uncle and aunt. this was the time i was patient.
18 a time i was patience was when my family went to @caps.i. adventures and we all wanted to go on the leaver water slide. the biggest water slide there. it had the longest line cher, it made a swerl and my family was at the end of the swerl. i was early morning when we had finally get in and went to the leaver water slide. it was huge just about @num feettall. and we got in line and only an half an hour had gone by when my mom let it. then another half an hour had gone by when my older brother left. now it was only my my other brother my sister, and my dad is left in line. when some one got hurt on the ride and the shut it down for two hours. finally they opened up the ride again so now my other brother and sister did not come with us. so now it is only my dad and me left in the line now. so it was our turn on the ride next when my dad get scard end left so it was me and an old man went on the same little fletch. the old man met his pance and l was so happy to finally get on.
17 one day @person s mom,  @caps  decited to go shoping and @person despretly wanted to go. but his mom kept saying @caps. so @person begged and begged s his mom finally said,  @caps but you cant complain  so @person went shoping with his mom. then @person and his mom arrived at the store. just about @date @person said.  i m board can we go now , his mom @caps @caps just be patient. @person then said,  patient you want me to be patient weve been here for like  @date hours , we have only been here for ten @date. i have @caps more patients said @person. so so his mom made a deal with @person it was, if you be good for @num more @date we will go to the ice cream place. the next @num @date made his mom go crazy with every second @person saying, i m board can we go now and hurry up. finally @person and his mom left. they got in the car and drove right past the ice cream place, @person said,  wait  we past it, his mom said i know. @person said  we made a deal, remember. it is mom said yup but you broke the deal, so what did you learn. @person said that when you make a deal sign a contract, his mom said,  @caps  patients is a virtue that you need to learn. so that is my story about patients in my own way.
20 someone l know that is patient is my mom. my mom is one of the most patient people l know. especially on this certain day. every once and a while my brothers and sister and l are just kind of hard to handle. we where on our way to church when my brother and l started arguing and fighting, for no particular reason, we always bicker and bother each other. my littlest brothe and my sister where frequently screaming and shouting at one another for dumb reasons like he stuck his tongue out at me  she pinched me. then we finally got to church l guess my mom figure it would stop once we got there, but no my three year old brother @person repeatedly ran around and threw the church. my oldest brother kept on calling my sister names and l kept talking with my friends. i know l would not be nearly that patient with anyone. so that is why l think my mom is so patient. after church that afternoon all she told us to do was behave, and after we realized how patient she was we just figured on our own that we should listen to her and behave.
10 this is a story about patience, one day my friende tells me hey did you ever be patient. i told him no i have never in my life been pacients, well you should he told me. one day my frend is telling my new game is coming out and i just talk why he was talking  i can tell that he did not like it at all, so in class i  am telling every one that i won him in race. but i had no patients on me so i stoted complaining to him i said  i won   and he said  you have no patienc and it  kepted going on and on. then my other friend said stop it right now! i am sick and tired of this you have no patients and you lost @num game! ok some time we all have complained in are life! just stop fighting please. so the next day i said do you have eny thing to tell me i will listen better now. i learnd that i should listen to what people have to say then talk that will  get  are friend ship to the next leveal.
13 being patient is like a jungle cat hunting its prey. it has to stay perfectly still to get it prey. it has to be patient too. then after it gets into the wright position it patses. the cat gets its goal by being patient.
21 do you ever fell like your @caps is going to expload? do you ever want to say something but don't because what you said will make things worse than they are? well that's how l felt in this story! little brothers and sisters make me so mad, that l want to expload. the story starts at @timepm my brother @location just got off work and has been complaining how he is sick of walking home by hiself so l was going to surprize him by walking home with him l just passed the high school and l heard my name being called so i looked around and l heard my name being called again the voice keep being called so l stoped and my sister @person, and my friend @location came up from behind me and stopped @person said  i didnt want you to walk to get @location by urself  so we keep walking and savanah and me keep switching and the scooter got slower, and slower and slower because two people were riding we stoped and pressed the power reset button and began to go again and then we called @location and said we didnt see him and it was already @num he said hes at his friend house and my mom was coming to get him. we turned around and two minutes later the scooter died we keep holding the power rest button nothing happened so l ran home to get the bike there was sweet running down my face and ?? none stop my legs were numb soon as l got to the house my legs colapest l got up and put shorts on, grabed the bike and ran out the door @person, and savanah were already at the party store @location questioned me and asked  @caps did it take you so long  i told her what happened as @person pushed the @person and savanah rode on the handle bars. in my @caps l was thinking about how long it took me to get there and now mad. l was they came and how l thought l was going to espload because the scooter died we put the bike and scooter away and walked in the door and droped. the lesson learned is dont do something unless your foresure its happening. i learned that the hard way and i'm never going to do it again.
12 patience when a person is patient the can wait a thousand years   for an answer. or he/she is understanding of what the problem is when you are stuck. i always think they are a saint when they have the patience to deal with their wife, children, and job at the same time, and keep his cool. that is amazing. patience is when the person is always their when you need help and he will give you patience by just around him. i think patience is calm, doesn t lose his temper and helps you when you need a little boost of patience
24 it was a nice sunny day outside, in the middle of the @date. it was so hot outside, it was like the sahara desert.  honey get your bathing suit on, and some shorts, and get into the car,  my mom shouted out the window.  @caps mom,  i questioned. it s a suprice she answered. so i did what she told me while wondering where @caps were going. when @caps got there, i knew exactly where @caps were. @state @caps. i got out of the car with a huge grin on my face.  @caps going to go on @caps @caps, want to come,  i asked my mom.  @caps, sounds like fun she replied.  when @caps got to this heart-throbbing roller coaster i looked, and the line was all the way to the end of the sidewalk.  @caps, i don t want to wait mom, its too long of a line,  i complained.  @caps patient, sweety @caps ll @caps on the coaster in no time,  she replied. one hour later     mom its taking forever.  i whimpered.  @caps are the next ones in line,  she replied still smiling. so when the gates opend i was so excited and nervous, i couldn t believe that i waited an hour to get on one ride.  you were very patient,  my mom said with her hair sticking straight up.  @caps i was, and @caps proud of that,  i said to myself.
14 there are many time @caps a persons life when someone was being patient. patient @caps a very important trait that could lead to it own rewards. i am a dancer at @organization of dance. there @caps a very wide range in age in each dance class. sometimes we have some trouble learning something as hard as a switch leap, or something as easy as a pieroette. everyone who @caps in the class @caps so patient when these events happen. it @month take fifteen minutes for the teacher to correct a footing position, and yet the other dancers remain seated, waiting over so patiently. patience also occurs while training a dog. obviously dogs don't speak @caps, so they are going to have trouble learning. yelling at the dog @caps a sign of not being patient which will not help the dog learn. but by praising the dog or correcting her/him gently, @caps a sign of being under control and patient? eventually by taking up all that time to teach him/her the rules, you will end up with a great dog, all because you were patient! as you can see, being patient brings happiness and confortability to others. not to mention, it @caps what @caps respectful. like i said, being patient @caps a very important lesson to learn and one should never forget it.
16 this is my story about being patient, i close my hope to be  write a stay about also you was patient . my way of that is me at a doctors office and waiting for @num hours to get a brace for my friend of wrist. first the setting are in waiting room then a office, with there was had to wait for @num hours. so me and my dad were in this waiting room it was suppose to be. @num appointment and she told us to sit down, and there are @num other people lellge.   so i said down thinking my mom his going to him ll. iany seemed first @caps and it was a till of there waiting because i will very patient. but my dad want he was worried and then fill sleep. as people went by help called to get loss patient, many and make. them and @caps hour presnt by, @caps i      ?    said life my for, but that should my child my mom. since had  or ion  i jumped out of my dad and woke my dad up and went to the mom. these up walked out hour, but i was patient. so the adder came in and gave me the brace got resettled in and left. that was a story about he being patient at doctors office and for a @num minutes thing.
14 one time i was patient was when i was in science class taking a test. i was patient because i went up to the teacher because i needed help and so did the kid in front of me. it took him a while but i just stood there and waited. it took him around @num minutes because he needed help with a lot of thing. that is the time i was patient.
8 patience is one of the most important things in life. patience is being understanding and tolerant. for example a kids mom left for work she takes @num hours and she come home. the kid said  that was quick.  that is what patience.
19 one time when i was patient was when my mom s car needed a new battery and i had to go to school. my mom called her friend that lived down the street to come and give us a boost. we waited an hour and a half waiting on her. my mom called called her back and she said she can t make it because she needed an oil change. after that we walked to the bus stop for thirty minutes, it picked us up and took us to @organization and @person. then we walked the rest of the way to @num mile and @person where the was another bus that took us to @num mile and @person where my school is. that was time when i was patient.
19 the time i needed patience. we were on the groccery store, @caps man to be exact.m when we first got there i was exited because we were going to get lots of junk bad, but ther. we started to get lots of food and it looked really good. i started to just eat it all. the cart was half way. ??? @caps we got more stuff and it was @caps full that we had to get another cart and it started to get hungry. but the time we were in the meat section, i was starving. my mom said  @caps me just get a couple one things.  @caps i waited, and waited @caps she told me to go to checkout. all of them were @caps long and i felt like i was ???(@caps @caps @caps) @caps this little girl walked up to me getting smart i couldn t take it, i was about to talk that little girl down. but i had to calm myself @caps, @caps i realized it was our turn and i was @caps happy. @caps when i got home mom cooked bacos and i was just ready to go to bed.
20 two summers ago, i helped out with kids camp at my church. i helped with the preschoolers for the week and that required a lot of patience. they were very exited and roudy. they were always running around and shouting. i had to keep a calm voice and be patient with the children or it would make the situation worse. later on this week, i was put in carge of a young, special needs kid. he just couldn t sit still! i had to remind him over and over not to be so loud. he was very determined to get what he wanted. it was hard to stay calm. dispite the hardship i managed to be patient and calm. the little boy decided  i was all right and started to behave. now, every time he sees me in the hallway he sais,  hi!  very excitedly. now am glad that i stayed patient.
22 some people have a lot of patience. i am one of those people. i have have had a lot of patience in my life. we were driving to @location's @caps and i was getting antsy. i knew this would be a hectic day for my mom so i decide to be patient and read. before i knew it we were there. i was waiting to get a lemonade with my mom and we had already been waiting here for @num minutes. i was starting to get tired of waiting in this long line for a little lemonade. but i knew my mom had already had a tiring day because my sister wouldn't stop complaining. so instead of complaining i stopped thinks about how long of would take to get our lemonade. i started thinking about what it would be like to ride the @caps and the next thing i knew we had our lemonade. i was starting to wish that we hadn't gotten in line for the @caps hawk because it was so long. i was really getting mad that it was taking this long to wait for a ride that was @num second long. but then i remembered that my mom was with me and she had a bad headace. so i shut my mouth. i was glad that i was patient that day. because if i wouldn't have been the my mom probably wouldn't have been as happy as she was at end the day.
12 i was very patient one time when my grandma was in the store. trying to build the whole store and i had to go to the bathroom real bad. i started to get real; mad because i thought the store person that was ringing up the stuff tryed to go slow so i couldn t use it. the only reason why i didn t complain was because most of the stuff and the bascket was mine. that was a time i was very patient
16 it was a @date @time at school so boring as usal and my @caps came in on cruches i freaked out and, ran over to her and she told me she broke her leg and that she wasn t allowed to hang out for a whole month. it was hard waiting a whole month to hangout with her but, her safety was more important than my amusement. it was @num weeks after my friend breaking her leg out, i was doin well of not bothering he so i was proud of myself, but i got to help her around school. it was a few more weeks later she was almost better so i was excited and went and bought her a gift. the next @date @person was out of the crauches and, cast and back on her foot that s the story of the time i was patient.
5 patience is sometimes hard to do if you are already exsited. but some time you are doing like if one of your family members is talking & you are waiting for something else that is patience
17 i chose write a story about a time when i was patient. it was my first time hunting, i was only hunting squirls but still. what i had to was walk in the woods and sit down once you sit down you cant move. so i was sitting very still for @num minutes and finally i seen a squirl. so i took my shotgun and shot her in the chest. i was patient so i got a squirl. so that s my story on patients.
20 well this story was sequenced out about ten minutes ago. when i had to keep a tremendous amount of patience. well as you can see there are multiple erase marks in the backround of my text. i accidentally wrote part two of this test on this page! i am so glad i had such a caring teacher that found that for me or i would ve failed! when i was sitting down at my desk quietly she (the teacher) walked up to me and held test up to my face. i knew that meant something bad. when she said i did it on the wrong page. i almost flipped out but i held it back. i think patience is a great quality to have so you can get things done right. i m very glad i have a good amount of patience.
16 when i have patient is when i go out to eat. so no one can speat in, my food. like one time i went out to eat with my family. and we all was dress alike for my birthday. so i ask my daddyto tell them that my birthday is to day. and i wanted a piece of cake now. so he want to tell what i said and they ??? give us a minute. so i waited and waited. and finly said bring me a piece of cake now or i will have this place brun down. then my dad said bring her a piece cause she can have that happen. so they finly bring my cake. and they sang happy birthday to me. and i was happy after that in tell i found out they speat in my food and ate itto. i had found out because before i lifte i heard some people talking about how they speat in my food. then i said wait did you in the fries they said yea. then i said o i don t care cause i didnt eat the fries. they said why i because i the fries is neasty. and i rolled my eyes and walked away. but i don t  do that because i scared somebody would do it again. that is why i have patience.
16 a time i was patient was when my sister got her lisense. when we got thare she pulled a ticket out of a michenie then it said   @num the screen said @num. i said well this should be short, @caps no like every preson was a half an hour @num min if were lucky. we stayed thare for @num hours strait i hope it dos not take that long for my lisence.
20 one time my @caps planned a fishing trip to @location. @caps @caps t know. he told me to pack my suit case for three days worth of clothes i said why he said we are going to @location tomorrow with your causins @person and ryan. i was so excited that i flew to my room and pounded cloths in my @caps and looked through everything i would need. i asked my @caps what we were doing there he said were going on a fishing trip in the @caps river for pike. the @caps @caps i got a new cherrywood fishing pole and a really nice underspin real. so i got my fishing poles ready packed my @caps and went to sleep so i could get up early. @num am come and my alarm went off i was so tierd i could barely see @caps we had to be at my uncles house at @num so i had to get ready. once we got to my uncles house we met them then we all left. i wanted to sleep in the car @caps i couldn t once we got in @location it was so cool with the huge cliffs and hills we even sas a bear @caps@number a river that we stopped at then we went up river and there was a clear mud hole withe millions of frog in it. when we finally got there my @caps made me wait and unpack. once me and my causin got @caps unpacking we went right to the store to fish my first cast i caught a little @num incher on a @organization. after that we caught nothing so we came back up when it got @caps and roasted hotdogs over the fire. the next morning we got up early and only fished on the lake @caps@number the @location we caught nothing. that night we went fishing on the @caps river and we still caught nothing. the guy that owned the cabin said we should cath @num or @num pike a @caps @caps it had rained seven feet so they wern t feeding. the next @caps we got up early again and fished all @caps. in the morning i had one hit we had nothing afterward. at lunch we found a little @location to eat lunch on it had a actual rock cave and we had scared a bear off the @location. later we went to this little canyon that was really hard to clime i almost fell halfway @caps @caps i got looked on a root. we saw another bear eating berries that we video taped and we killed a chipmunk with a @caps rock that we threw @caps. wham it almost took my pole i fought it for about ten minutes i waited and waited it was a digantic pike @caps it shapped my line and i still have never seen that pike.
23 for some people it is as hard as a rock, but to some it just comes naturally. patience is a big part of hunting. you must be tolerant and understanding. even if things seem to take a turn for the worst. take this for example. i had woke up at six and jumped out of bed. i was finally going to shoot my first deer! i pulled on my camofage and hunter s orange as my grandpa drove down my long drive way to get me. the moon light shone bright and i was giggling with exitment, but i knew i had to calm down. as we drove to the place i was going to hunt i was amazed by how quite evreything was. we walked back to the blind on a leaf covered trail and set evrething in it s place. after, dosing of a little the morning light seemed to peek through the trees and light up the fresh green field. the water vapor looked like sparkles floting in mid air. we heard a grouse drum and had a red squarle jump out at us, but no deer. after a long morning of sitting we disided to pack up. we always had tomarrow. so that was the end of our hunt. we had an exiting time, and it was all because of patience. patience @month not always help in ways you wish, but it can help you see many diffrent and beautiful things.
23 a time when iwas patient was a last @date. my friend, @caps, took me to cedar point in @location. the place was so packed, it took five minuites to get from the car to the entrance. as we got in, the place looked amazing! it was almost like a dream. they even had a ride to take you from one part of the park to another. the first ride we went on  was the @organization. we waited, and waited for about ten minuites and then things got boring. it had been almost fifteen minuites and we weren t even close to the ride! so we waited , and waited about ten more minuites, and things got a little faster. at this part, the line was moving a little faster. finally, it was our turn to ride. we had a yellow car, and you could feel the adrenallen already. after we were strapped in, the person who locks people s seats said  go!  and we took off like a bird. in the end, it was worth being patient
10 a time l had to be parcint was at the doctor tick tock. the clock went around and around. it was so boring are started to say the abc's forwards and back yards every time a doctor came out they did not call me l sat and sat with nothing to do i tride to fall asleep that did not work l tried to wach t.v but the only thing that was on @caps @caps. finally after two hours the called me in
19 it was bright sunny day, and i was playing with my play doe. finally i finished making my tower it took a hour fixing. i started at it in amazement. i was proud very proud at myself. i got out a piece of play doe and i made it into the  @caps  i  put it on the top of the tower. well my five minutes of amazement was near its end @caps! i look up to see that my tower was ruined . i look infront of me and see my neiber i told him why did he do that he said because it s fun. i told him it s fun for you but not for me. it took me an hour to finish it it s a good thing i was patient. he looked down and said @caps sorry for what i did. i told him it all right, how about if we build it again but even better. he agreed and we both set to work. see how patience is important the problem could have become bigger. the end.
17 once on @date break my family and i went to @location. while we were at @location we went to a huge water park. my two sisters and i convinced my parents to go there. a few days later we went to the water park. we rented a locker, changed our clothing, and started looking for waterslides. right as we walked in there was a huge (take) sunken ship. on the very to where zip- lines! we all ran to the ship and realized that there was a line. not a short line. a giant line. we must have been there @num minutes waiting. eventually it came my turn. i grabbed the handle and kicked off the ground. i had almost reached the end when it slowed to a stop. i let go falling into a pool. the wait was totally worth it!
14 a time when i was patient was on the city bus. so me and my mom could go to walmart. we waited for @num hours till we got there. before we got on we had to pay a @money each. then ask for transfer very nicely. t hen hop on another bus then get off and go shopping. then wait till bus comes back and go home after @num hours. then get of bus at the corner and walk back to the house.
14 i was patient for @date @caps @date present. it was almost @date @caps @date and i m kept asking for @date presents, but @date mom kept saying no. it was getting closer and closer and i kept asking, until @date mom said be patient you will get them don't worry, but of course i had a hard  time being patient. final it was the @date and i couldn't wait but i had to. @date i went to bed i asked once more and again she said no. the @date come and i went to school. i was so happy because today was @date @date and i got present's to @date, i got home and @date mom was waiting with a cake and a present, she said  there are more  . that was the t i tryed being patient.
24 being patient is a very hard and difficult thing to do sometimes, but we have to go throught it. being the one who is patient usually pays off. we were on our way to the airport and me and my two younger brothers couldn t wait to get to @location. we got to the airport thinking we would get right on the airplane. but when we got there we found out we had to wait @num  hours until the plane left and we d be on our way to @location. so we decided to play our games we brought with us. we were being very patient. finally it was time for us to get on the plane. we walked through the long tube that leads to the airplane door. we sat in our seats, buckled up and we were ready for takeoff. we heard the pilot talk into speakers  i m very sorry, but there is a severe thunderstorm appearing on the radar, we @month not proceed until it clears up.  @caps!?  @caps long will it take?  asked my mom.  about five hours,  she said. it s a good thing we brought our @caps player so that would hold us off for about two hours. for the rest of the time, played, slept, and just waited patiently. the flight attendant came up to us and said that since we very patient for the whole five hours, even my three year old brother, she would reward us with five @organization world pass tickets for my family. in conclusion, when you are patient, no matter @caps hard it is you will maybe get rewarded just like my family.
21 there was a fish named @caps. @caps live around the @caps archipelago, a dangerous place for fish that couldn't slow down quickly. luckily, @caps was the legendary many codscanth all that specif does is float slowly. yesterday, @caps caught two fish and gave them to his wife. today all of fish are in the desert, which @caps absolutely despises. using his patience, @caps waits for something to jump out. suddenly, @caps sees a big chunk of meat on something shiny. at was too far away to grab, though. @caps went home to his wife. the next day, @caps went to the current and saw the floating meat again. @caps lunged for it and started chewing when something stabbed him. @caps started pulling fiercly when @caps heard a snap. when @caps tugged again @caps fell into the current. @caps was finnaly free! @caps also realized the current felt pretty nice. @caps ate a couple of fish and slept. when @caps woke up, @caps saw a big ugly fish standing on two fins. @caps couldn't breath and @caps was in a not @caps snapped at one of the fins of the other fish and died.

14 on @date i understand what my mom was saying to @caps. she told @caps she couldn t get @caps anything for @caps because she had to pay the bills. she thought that she wasn t doing a lot for @caps, i told her i m fine with what i got. i just wanted to be around her for @caps but she didn t understand that she was doing good on her own my father was not helping her take care of us. my mom had to take care of her @num kids but her self and @num of them is hises.  but my daddy would always say i know if he had it he would give to @caps. but beening @caps i didn t want to heer his stuff cause it all was lies. my mom had to found tow jobs, to keep up with everything. then when @date came everything was ok into @date my grandma passed away. my mom, auntie and uncle @person all had to make money for all here stuff she looked pretty everything went while but know on on we still cry in think about her. then that was a time i didn t patient because it was to hard to think she was gone. so my mom and them all tell @caps that i need to learn to understand she s in a better place with some of her love ones. but into this day i can t understand the meaning of when someone says they are gone. but @caps forgotten.
20 the time i was patient. one day we were on our way to @organization. our trip was only suppose to be three ours long but one of cars that was following us was stopped by something that slashed their tire. we had an hour to wait before they would get their tire fixed and would catch up with us. they had to past the traffic and long stoplights also. we waited at a gas station and they caught up. everyone used the restrooms which took fifteen minutes and the restrooms were so gross so it took a minute to dress them appropriatly for use. there were three cars containing five to six people which took up more time. after we were all done we piled back into each vehicle and got back on the way to @organization. we were passing all signs of kings that said  @organization @organization  and @organization @organization up ahead  and even of course when we got there i saw this huge, digital sign that played music and said  @caps to .@organization @organization ! we were finally there! we were excited and had the time of our lives!!! by: unica @caps .amstrong
7 time i was patient was when my friend was coming over i was excited. but i waited and waited. but she finna @caps. thats about it.
15 in this narrative essay i will write about @num different times when i was out had to be patient. such on the waiting to get out of school on a holiday. and when i had to wait until my mom woke up to go to the mall so i could get my game. another thing i had to wait for was to get my final so as in the ??? all these times i had to be understanding. one day  i was very anxious to get out of school on a firday. and to make it i bad the clack was drare and i had  a planned schedule of my think day. when one thought passed by there like another set  in thinking for way i can stare at the abat and it would change. i was about to get a call home but the @caps.a saved me. and i had to be understanding about that moment. another time i had to be understanding about was when i had to wait until my mom woke up so i could go to the mall. see what had happened was i got a @num @num last year on my report and a new game was coming out so i wanted it. my mom was asleep it was almost impossible to wake her up because she went to the club the night before. and that was the time i had to be patient.
12 i was very patient last time i went to the doctors, @caps and my brother @caps had to wait outside in the waiting room until they called us in for our shots. everybody else was getting to go a head of as and we stayed patient. it got really boring sitting in there but we stayed patient. after about two or three hours we were not as patient as we were a couple of hours ago. so we decide to go up and ask what was going on .we found out that we forgot to sign in and so once we did we got in.
17 being patient means that you are understanding and tolerant. a patient person experiences difficulties without complaining. one time when i was patient is when my parents did not know it was a half day at school. one day in elementary school we had a half day which parents didn t know about. after school i waited in the parking lot for close to @num minutes waiting for my parents to pick me up. i was starting to think my parents weren t coming until a teacher asked me what i was doing. after i explained my situation the teacher let me call my parents. my dad had a appogized and went to get me after i explained then i could finally go home.
11 one day it was this girl in @caps really wanted to go school shoping in @caps hade to wait because her mother said @caps don t get her money now @caps got it later in @caps her mom said wait in tell latter @caps did not now that her new stuff was up in her room so when her mom get back @caps had said we is going to go @caps her mom said go get it jacket upstairs in her room. @caps went upstairs to get her jacket when @caps went up in her room @caps saw new cloths in five pere of new shoews and @caps hade scream in @caps came down stairs in told her mom thank you @caps said you welcome @caps her mom said i told you i was going to get your stuff in the @caps said you just have to wait payshent.
15 being patient is a very difficult thing to do. many people can t be patient. for example my brother. if he orders something online or is wait for dinner be perparred he always has to be winey of when he s going to get what he wants. i m not like that. i actully have patience. for example i needed shoes so i searched the internet to see if i could get a good deal. i was searching on the @organization store when i saw these really good shoes. i asked my dad if i could order them online. so the next day my mom orders them online, i was so excited, i waited and waited. after three day i missed my school bus. my mom had to go to college and she couldn t drop me off. so i stayed home alone. i found out that my dad was comeing home that exact day and the house was a mess. so i started cleaning. my mom came home and saw a box laying on the front. she picked it up and opened the box and saw my shoes were in there! i went to go welcome her and i saw my shoes lay there. i jumped up in excitement and put them on and it was a perfect fit. my mom came in the room and said they were suppose to arrive on @date but since you were patient they came early.
23 today was the final day of tryouts. the deciding day .tryouts we over i patiently waited for the @caps to hand out the envelopes to all @num girls. i didn t know if could handle this.  @caps until you ve left the building to open your envelope,  @caps @person said.  @caps s only fair .if everyone opens them in here then people who don t make the team will be sad and bummed while the girls who did would be jumping for joy, which would make the girls who didn t make @caps feel even more bummed and left out .be patient and @caps until you leave the building.  she called my name .i came up and grabbed my envelope .she dismissed us .some girls opened their envelopes right away .but, they didn t make @caps .karma .i waited until i got outside. i could barely @caps .i needed to know but i had to @caps .patience isn t such a lovely thing always. l opened my envelope. i made the team! i was so excited and i was glad i had the patience to @caps and be surprised.
24 i elevator tapping my foot, smooth jazz music humms out of speakers above me. eventually the all too familiar click was head and the smooth metal doors slid open to reveal a well furnished hallway with many other people waiting @caps their turn of departure on the ??? i slipped out, trying now to become trampled by the massive crowd, then, silence. my footsteps echoed off the ??? as i searched @caps room @num. finnaly finding my destination i open the door and step inside where many other squirring children are waiting. i remove my coat and hang it on a nearby hook, trying not to draw too much attention to myself. i continue by searching through the magazine section, torn up @caps magazines and delicately handled sports illustrated are flipped through until i find an interesting looking article on swimming. magazines under my arm i choose a seat in the far corner to wait in. minutes pass, i can tell that the child next to me is becoming impatient fast, he taps his mothers jacket repeatedly and asks the same thing he did @num minutes ago,  @caps how much longer?  the mother checks her watch and in a closely annoyed tone replies,  not much longer now dear.  @caps, the little boy slumps back in his seat and jams his thumb into his mouth to keep him occupied. i roll my eyes, but can t help but crack a smile at his actions. somewhere across the room, a girl about my age frowns as @caps texts on her cellphone, after a quick glance at the clock @caps scowls and continues. just then, the glass door slides open and a woman with a homemade perm and tired eyes steps out. across the waiting room, patients look up at her, their eyes full of anticipation and hope.  @person  the doctor is ready to see you now.  @caps, i avoid the angry glares from other patients and follow her out the door.  you know it s funny,  @caps says well snapping her gum.  @caps someone. so young you were the most patient person out there!  i merely nod my head and grin because i understand that patient people, experience difficulties without complaining and i am very grateful that i m a patient person.  stand in the
24 once when i was a little boy, about seven years old i was extremely patient about an @caps toy i wanted. ever since @caps the @caps @organization bender was on television and in stories now i was crazy about them and i still am today the @caps @caps the only person in the @caps world who can master all four element @caps, @location, @caps, @organization . now i can write you a whole entire book about the @caps. so i saw a @caps had set on t.v. so i asked my mom could she buy it. and she said when i get the money, but until then no. so of course i was upset. so i was waiting counting until the days went buy. then final that very @caps came, and you know what that means.  @caps @caps  the @caps has arrived the @caps i get my toy but i didn t know that she only got two hundred dollars so i had to wait another week. i was so upset that i ran up steair and locked my door and cryed myself to sleep. my birthday was coming up. i was so upset that i forgot all about the @caps and when my birthday was here can guess what ? i finally got the best of all. the @caps and my mom said that all that patients you did got what you wanted.
20 a time that i was patient was when my friend and i were at @organization vaction. i was having a blast. my family didn t come because they don t like roller coasters. we dicided to ride the @caps, it looked like a really long wait. after an hour and a half of waiting it started to rain. it was just sprinkling at first but it was enough so they had to close some rides, including the @caps. we really wanted to ride so we waited until the rain stopped. after another hour the people left so we were at the front of the line. my friend and i got front row seats and had a lot of fun. it was worth waiting @num and a half hours @organization it and we even went on it twice.
16 i am going to write about the time that i was patient. one day, after my family and i came back from church, i asked my room i she could make breakfast, but she would not answer me because she was on the phone with my grandma and my grandma talks a lot. it was so oganizing. for example, i kept paceing back and forth but then i just sat down. after an hour of patientience, my mom and grandma said goodbye and hung up the phone and i finally got my breakfast.
18 a time when i was patient was just yesterday. i had just finished part @num of the rest and i was very anxious and i wanted to get up and more around, but were taking the @caps so i could not. instead i entertaind myself in any way i could such as pretend singer writing running songs through my head repeatedly, even twiddling my thumbs! so finally she let us get and talk. i was sitting next to some of my friends so i just talked to them. somehow we got into talking about dangeons and dragons, they kept asking me what class they would be and what they were. anyway i kept trying too talk but i keep geting interupted so i just relaxed and waited for my turn. finnaly it was my turn to talk, but we had to go to lunch so i never did get to say what mine was.this is a time when i was patient.
20  @caps go! , i yelled while running to the entrance of @caps @caps.  @caps a minute, you got to @caps for your friend , my mom said. as i stopped to @caps for my mom, my best friend @person and @caps brother @person i started to kick the rocks to keep me occupied. once they finally caught up to me, we walked into the huge theme park.  @caps go to the top @caps @caps , i said histaticly.  @caps, we can go on it, but me and @person are staying in the back , my mom said.  @caps@number because me and @person are going in the front row! , @person yelled. as we started to walk to the line it said that it would be a @num minute @caps for us to go. after we got in line i thought to myself, wow this is a long line. it wasn t that much longer that we finally got to the rollercoaster ride.  @caps! , the belt bucble sounded when we all got in the rollercoaster.  @caps! , everybody said when we took off.  after that i told myself i can be patient.
20 @person is a young boy with a bladder of a squirrel and his waiting in line for the bathroom at the super @caps. @person said to himself, ''patience, something good always comes from being patient''. so he waited for his turn. @person was in the middle of the line behind five people. @person was a head of six people that were all doin the pee-pee dance. he learn to be polite in school so he let the six people go ahead of him. ten minutes later, @person entered the bathroom and he found a one hundred dollar bill on the floor. @person knew more about finders keepers than being polite, so he took it. @person learned being polite and patient is the right thing to do, plus it has its rewards sometimes.
18 have you ever been patient or been told your patient? patience has patience is a @num year old girl who is always told how patient she @caps is one of many stories about patience being very patient. one day patience wanted to go to the most amazing amusement park in juancey so her mom started to look it up on the internet. it take her mom two weeks to get every thing ready, she had the amusment park picked out, the money to go, and the hotel they are going to stay at @time. the whole time patience said nothing and just waited without asking her mom if she had everything planned yet or if she was still taking her an amusment park. when they got to the hotel patience mom had to get the room key get to their room unpack and get dressed to go. the whole patience didn't say anything. when they finally got to the amusement park there was a looong line to get tickets so they had to wait for two hours. the whole time patience did not complain. they finally got their ticket and picked the biggest roller coaster to go on first. but there was a looong line for that to, patience told her mom she really wants to go on this ride and wants to wait in line. her mom said ''ok '' and they waited for an hour until they get to go on it, but all the waiting was worth it. patience was patient through all the waiting and in the end went on all the roller coasters and had fun. that is patience story of being patient. i hope you liked it.
17 a time when i was patient is when i play volleyball. i m patient when i play volleyball because when you don t score points, you don t get to serve. one game we weren t doing so well and i really wanted to serve because my overhand was doing great. everybody got to serve except me on that maten. in the end our team ended up winning  i never complained one time about not being able to serve. every body cheered and chanted because won by two points.

24 book @caps  and the characters lived happily ever after  ..for now!  @caps! @location shut the book, very sad that no more pages we re left. this was the third book in her series, and she absolutely just needed the fourth. in the school the next day, she went straight to the library. she opened the doors, and was greeted with that dusty old book smell that she loved.  @location made a bee line for her favorite shelf, holding her favorite books. @location scanned the shelfs, quickly noticing the book was missing. she @caps the librarian, @person, about @caps, and was surprised to find the book checked out already. she put her name on the waiting list, sour about her name being tenth. the next day was @date. @location went to the library @caps @person @person about the book. the results we re very disappointing. her name was @num, which was pretty good for only one day, @caps when she was home, she was in a very sour mood.  @caps s wrong!  @caps her mom.  @caps, i really wanted this book, @caps @caps was already checked out. my name is @num on the list, @caps @caps could be ages until those other people finish.   @caps, i think you have to learn some patience  said mom.  patience? @caps s that?  @caps @location  patience is when you wait for something, and you don t complain about @caps. take you, for example, your being very impatient.   @caps i m waiting  said @caps  @caps, @caps you are complaning a whole lot.  the next day, @location was as patient as she could be. she did not go to the library and ask for the book, and she went the whole without complaining. later on. @location was called to the office. when she got there, she found @person and @person, the secretary.  @caps  said @person.  @caps s this?  @caps @location  @caps is the book you wanted. @caps s checked out to your acount, and all ready to read.   @caps you  said @location. she couldn t belive @caps! she finally got her book! moral: patience pays off, especially when your willing to wait.
20 one day just before football practice, my lock on my locker got stuck. all @num of the coaches tryed to get it off. all of them except for one, coach @person. he stayed in the locker room with me trying to get it off. when we realized it wasent coming off we had to find the @caps. when we found him we asked for bolt cutters. we had o walk all the way across the school to get them. once we had them we had to walk back to the locker room. when we got there he tryed to cut the lock. he tryed for @num min. they wouldent work. so we had to walk back across the school to the tool room and get another pair. this one finally cut the lock after @num min. i think this took a lot of patients from coach @person.

24 @caps @caps, @caps-@caps, @caps-@caps! the sound ratling through @caps cars. all  i can think about is after @caps and lunch. i grow more impatient as the clock ticks and @caps heart throbs. i do not like the meap for that reason. during the reading selection all i think is,    @caps has to be the most boring story in history    then i turn the page, @caps, @caps one is,    @caps makes me so impatient. all i wanna do is finish the test. little beams of sweat read @caps slow but i do not want to be the last to turn @caps in. in the writing i think    @caps@number am i going to write about?    @caps hand starts to ache, and @caps head will pound because of everyones pencil running as if @caps were in a horror film. @caps-@caps, scribble-scribble, eek-eek, bom, bom, then you have to read over and over, make sure you have a title and read hand writing. the most nerves working of all, is the math segment. there are question i forgot. all the math teachers seem to cram all of @caps in @caps head at once. @caps is absolutely terrifying. then while your testing, there is someone who can sit still and their desk starts rattleing. well, if anyone could not tell, one, i am very impatient and two, i do not like the meap. @caps-@caps is the most annoying sound. along with many others, i am trying to get a good score. @caps- @caps, little, beams of sweat, libom bom, eek, eek scribble- scribble.

21 one day my mom came home from work. she came in and said  @caps, do you want to go shopping for your clothes @caps or later?  i chose @caps. so my mom changed her clothes and we were off to the store. it was around @num so it was rush hour. it seemed like it was taking forever and i was getting mad. then my mom said be patient and it will be over soon. this is a time when i was patient. after ten minutes, things started to clear up. it still took a while but it was getting better. in less than twenty minutes we were pulling up in the @location parking lot. there was a few cars in the lot but it didn t seem like much. when we got into the store that s when i really was mad. the lines for you to purchase your items lead all the way to the back of the store. then my mom said  @caps look. the lines are long as you can see. are you sure you can handle this and have patients?   i ll try . i said. after we got in the store we were looking for my clothes, we were looking at the long lines also, to see if they went down some. we got my clothes, then got in line. we spent about an hour worth of time in the line and it made me mad. not only did it make me mad, it made me hurgy because i skipped lunch. when we got out of the store, we were happy and hungry. we left the store and went to @caps.donalds. when we were down the street from @organization, there was this traphic line we got closer and closer to @organization and then realized that line was the @organization line. we got in the lot and i knew for sure that i was going to have more patients. so we waited and the line went really fast. we got up to the spoorker and my mom ordered a fish sandwich for her and a chicken sandwich for me. we got to the next window and they gave us our food. when we got our food, the lady said  @caps you for your patients . then she asked us would we like a free frie of any size for our wait. we told her yes and we will take a large frie. my mom turn to me and said  do you see what happens if you be patient?  i said yeah and patients is a good thing to have. that was a time when i was patient.
20 it takes patience when you are out hunting. after about @num deer seasons my patience paryed off. i was using a bow and ran @num point walked out. he was about @num yards from my stand and i called him closer. then he was @num yards from my stand. i took the shot and he buckled and the @num minutes i waited to find him felt like in life time. then i got out of my stand he ran about @num yards and droped. when i got to him. i was so excited because he wasn't won @num point he was a @num point back. do remember use the regin blood head and be patient you could shoot the deer of a lifetime.

10 i m always having to be patient. it s because i have an older brother that doesn t do what he is told. let s say my dad tells him to clean the bath room, well it takes him ten minuts to get up, then i have to go when he s cleaning and he won t let me. so i m that s one of the reasons. another is my older sister she s always on the phone so i barely ever get to use it. so i wait until my parents get home so they yell at he to get off, that s why i m very patient.
12 there was a time when i really wanted to go somewhere, and my mom said  @caps not tonight,  because it was a school night. so i said  okay i know it s a school night,  @caps at least i said it with maners and loyalty! and thats a time i when i was loyalty to someone and here is a time when i stuck up for someone, well my bestfriend was in a fight with this other girl and it was in person and i went right up to my @caps friends  enimey  and said why don t you just go home and leave my friend alone and she backtalked me then finally we started ignoring her then she left, that s a time when a stuck up for my bestfriend while she was in a fight. 
17 when i had to go to the doctor. i had thought that i would be in front. it was over @num people there in line when we got there more people was still coming. i had to get my shots. so we had to wait patiently. but my mom could not wait because it was so many people there in front of use. so i fell asleep. she was still walking around. so wen i woke up five people had already gone by. she still could not be patient, still walking around making me nervous then another @num went by its going really really slow. then she finally cooled down. she was so patient because they said they was going to put her out. i have never seen her so patient it was no believable.

8 my story in own way about being patience is when there is like @num people in front of a line a ceter point. you have to be patient in the lines because other were before you so you have to wait your turn in line before you go because thats called cutting and you will get kicked out of places if u do that you don t want that to happen because like say that you want something to eat you have wait your turn in line so you don t get kick out of the rides you have to wait your turn so you don t get the secrety on you.

17 i am writing about a time when someone i knew was extremely patient. he was having to be patient with one thing: @caps. when i was very young, once at a hotel pool, i had almost drowned. since then i was afraid to swim. so, my patient friend taught @caps how to swim at a pool in his trailer park. what he had to be patient about though was getting @caps into the deep water of the pool. he wanted @caps to go to the deep end of the pool but i was to afraid i would drown. so then he decided he needed to get @caps into the deep end somehow. we got out of the pool and walked to the deep end. he just told @caps to jump in, but he should ve realized i wouldn t just jump in. he did eventually get @caps into the water of the deep end, but all i would do was hang onto the edge and not let go to swim or anything. so after that, i just got out and he began to get a little frustrated. he was patient though, and kept working with @caps. after what seemed like hours, he pretended he was going to give up on @caps. i told him if he stayed, i d go in the deep end. so he did, and i jumped in and realized it wasn t so bad after all. so now i love swimming, especially in the deep ends. that s how my friends hard work and patience payed off for both @caps, and him.
16 hunting when you are turkey hunting you need to be extremly still and quiets did you have to have a lot of patience. if you move even a musle all the turkeys will run away. some times you will be sitting for hours and hours just waiting on the one shot. i remember when i was  hunting with my dad @caps sitting under a tree fro probablee three hours and finally a turkey came, unfortunutly just about when i had a shot my dad scared them all away but i still had the patience to stay out there for another @num hours. that is my example of patience.
21 have you ever had to be patient before? i have and this story will tell you all about it. last year on my birthday my uncle @caps promised me a phone but i had to wait for him to get the money. i had to be patient. so i waited and then @date finally came, more months passed and i still hadn t heard from my uncle. i began to become fustrated with him because he promised me that phone. i told my mom and she said he has always been like that and to keep my patience so what if he got it a little late. i was thinking in my haad a little it s been almost a year! then on @date my uncle came over for my family reunion.then he told me he knows that i thought he forgot about the phone. i  knew he was right but just then a little light bulb went off in my head he couldn t have forgotten about. soon it was time to eat and that is when he presented the @caps touch to me. i was so excited i just had to jump up and give a hug. he told me that whenever he promised me something he would test my patience to see if the wait was worth waiting and in this case it was. so whenever your patience is being tested keep your cool it will all come to you soon. to conclude this story i want to say patience is important to have because without it you will never be able to wait for anything in life. the @caps.

18 a time when i had to be patient was when i needed help with my schoolwork. my dad is very smart so whenever i needed help, i usually ask him for help. well i get out of school at @time my dad gets at @timeso,if  i wanted his  help , i would have to wait myself  but i didn t understand it. even with homework that needed help on back in my backpack until my dad got home i wished the homework that didn t need help on. after my homework   that which i did all my @caps, then it was time to eat, as i ate my dinner. by that time i was done waiting my dad me, more and really to help we as my dinner. it was last to go to wait over my dad to help understand it so much more.
16 will i was patiently waiting for my little sister to arrive that farthers day morning in @date i was so exicted. i m not a very patient person so when it came to this it was so hard to sit still. waiting for my turn to hold her was hard but when she was in my arms it was the must ama-zing feeling in my life. it s always hard having to leave her when she s calling your name it s like i want to cry. i don t always get to come home to a little girl saying my name but i love every minute i do. i always patiently wait to see her again but it is hard if you know what i mean.
46  softball has to be one of the single most greatest sports alive; playing softball in college has always been a goal of mine. i love the dirt that sticks to your face, the sweat dripping from your forehead, and the gallons and gallons of water you poor all over yourself to keep cool in the blistering @caps. although i love softball i feel that the memories you acquire from the times you have with your teammates, are the things you remember the most through out your softball career. i have always had great memories through softball many laughs, tears, and frustrations so when i had the opportunity to play on a top notch team i looked forward to all the many more memories i would have.  hood @caps @caps was my team name, i had played almost four years with this local team. many of these girls were like sisters to me they had treated me amazingly through out my years playing with them. i felt like i had my set team, i was going to play with these girls all though high school and we would become even closer. as my fifth year now approached i was looking forward to it, but when my dad came up with the idea that maybe i play for a team not as locally, that idea was also very enticing. i now faced a big dilemma either stay with the team i knew so well and continue to play with them until high school ended; or play with a team i knew nothing about, play with girls that might not like me, girls that were so much better then me, and looked down upon me. as i looked at the pros and cons of both teams i decided no; i would stay with the team that i knew so well and i would stay comfortable at where i was at. at that point softball was just around the corner and i began to reanalyze everything. did i really want to stay and be comfortable? or maybe challenge myself to become a better player; maybe i could work hard enough, and have college scouts take a look at me and hopefully have me play for them later. i then decided i would take a chance and try for this team.  as my dad and i drove to the field where i would try out for this team, my stomach was in knots. i wanted this team to like me, i was playing all the possible ways in my head i could greet them so i didn't sound snobby or a grump. the time moved quickly and i wished it would slow; my heart felt like it was beating a million times per second. i was so nervous my mouth began to feel sticky and have an odd taste to it, soon after my mouth became bone dry no taste, no flavor, just a sticky mess. the car then was stationary my dad looked at me and just said  ready or not here we come . nervous began to take over my body my arms were shaking uncontrollably and i was second guessing every move i made, i even had troubles removing my seat belt.  as i approached the field it felt like time was in slow motion, walking by i saw all the girls turn there heads to see what new fresh meat had arrived. my first thought was to run; that was it i didn't want to go, i was done i wanted home i was ready to start my year with the @caps, i just couldn't take it. then as i walked onto the field they all grew a smile. each and everyone of them told me their names, there favorite color, and a small fun fact about themselves. i found myself laughing through out my whole try out, there were no awkward moments and i enjoyed my time there. i couldn't wait to go back, i now had made new friends, friends i knew i would grow close with. my year with this team was amazing i have friendships with these girls that i never would have discovered if i hadn't gone. those girls are like family, and the coaches even more so. laughter played a very big role in the decision i made to play with this team, if i had just gone and tried out, and had i not had fun and laughed, i would have decided to play with the @caps. i have had great memories with the @caps, but also softball is all about going out discovering new friendships; therefore, enjoying the sport as well as the people.
40  some people like making people laugh, i love it. i will do most anything to get a good laugh. i will make fun of my self, do insanely stupid things, and sometimes hurt myself (not in any serious way). when i was little i didn't really understand laughter. for some odd reason i could never tell the difference if people were laughing at something or laughing with it. i was kind of  special  in some areas as a kid (i still am today). still at the tender age of five i loved making people laugh, and being special i would do even crazier things for a laugh. mind you i was kind of a spaz, and a really big spaz. i was the most hyperactive five year old you will ever meet. for example one time i hit myself in the head with a hammer, another time i was dancing around in class with a pencil in my hand, stabbed myself in the head with it, and needed stitches. one of the craziest times though was a couple days before i had to take pictures and i wanted to go play outside, my mom knowing how  special  i was (i got it from her) wouldn't allow me to. the expert persuasive kid i was back then convinced her to let me go outside. before i could even reach the street i fell head first on to the corner of the sidewalk leaving a huge mark and completely ruining the pictures. although that might make some people laugh, this is a story about laughter not me being a spaz.  now that you know that i love making people laugh, i'm  special , and that i'm a complete spaz i can get on with the story. well i was in kindergarten and i loved school because i got to hang out with my friends and play with blocks, that might sound stupid but i was in kindergarten. the only thing i didn't like about kindergarten was bully's. surprisingly i have never had a bully except kindergarten, but this was a bad bully. he would give me wedgies at story time and the whole deal (which was the best time to do so because the teacher could couldn't see). i still know the bully too, but he's no bully anymore, he's a goody two shoes now which i think is odd. anyways, kindergarten was a very good year for me except one day (and every day i got a wedgies). that day is what this whole story is about, it's why i told you i love making people laugh, why i told you i'm  special , and a spaz, everything in the story circles around this one day, *dramatic pause* in kindergarten. it started out like any other day in kindergarten. i woke up, did my daily routine, hopped in the car, and headed to school. when i got to school i grabbed my daily binder and patted the education sign like a mall cop would pat the observe and report sign. i did all my work and colored (which was basically all my work). it came around break so we ran around the play ground and got are little snack. when we finished getting the last few drops out of our juice boxes we headed over to story time. we were all in the little circle (which was more like a deformed oval) listening to the story, right when i would get into the story and lose my guard i would receive an excruciatingly painful (for a five year old) wedgie. the story was almost finished and our five year old attention spans were wearing thin and we were getting all excited. the story finally finished and we were standing up, and this is where my memory starts to fade. i cracked a really funny joke and the whole kindergarten class erupted into laughter, me being a  special  spaz that can't tell if people are laughing at me or with me burst into tears. i remember balling my eyes out at the drinking fountain trying to hide my tears. one of the teachers tried to help me by telling me that they were laughing at my joke. it took me a couple minutes to stop crying but a little longer to realize the were not laughing at me.  to this day i still get reminded by classmates about that day, of course i can laugh about it now but that was in kindergarten, i'm in ninth grade now and for people to remember that is kind of crazy to me. it was a negative experience then, but it turned into a blessing in disguise. it made me grow into a better person, i can tell the difference of laughter and also be okay when people do laugh at me (doing dumb things to make people laugh at me is actually my forte). so remember, being  special  could sometimes be the best thing about you, what makes you who you are, what makes you great, what makes you grow, what makes people laugh.
38  these days you don't really need a reason to laugh. laughter just radiates out of some people as frequent as a breath of air. i believe that everyone has someone they can laugh with because everyone has someone they enjoy being around. one of the people i enjoy being around most is my best friend @person. no matter what the situation, whenever we are around each other we end up having fun. laughter can turn a bad day completely around. one of my most recent examples of the power of laughter happened just a few weeks ago. one of my,  friends , tried to play a cruel joke on me that ended up being a bigger mistake than she could have imagined. once i had figured out that this person whom i once trusted was trying to spite me i became overwhelmed with my emotions. at one point i actually considered attacking this girl right in the middle of every one in school. thankfully i used my better judgment to run away from her, and hide instead of hurt her. half of the class period progressed and i was still very upset and unprepared to confront her. so there i stayed safe in hiding until my best friend found me. @person had come to comfort me after she got wind of what happened. she talked to me until i calmed down and my tears stopped. she made me feel much better. her just being there for me, and being able to remonis in the fun times we had together and the laughs we shared, seemed to make all my problems disappear. eventually she convinced me to go talk to my, friend , who as it turns out was ashamed of herself for her actions. we were able to make up and return to a somewhat normal life. to this day and more than likely for the rest of my life i will believe that laughter is the best medicine. i guess i'm lucky in that i have found the best person in life for me to share all of my laughter with. every body has to have a somebody.
30                             the @caps @caps @caps story is about how i fell in dog @caps and stepped in it, i fell off of a slippery trampoline.about four or five years ago i went too a friends house to stay the @time. that day was a hot day so my friend and i devised a plan to have fun and stay cool, so my friend and i went to the garage and found the sprinkler, so we decided to put the sprinkler under the trampoline and when u do that it makes the trampoline wet and slippery. my friend and i started jumping on the trampoline and he was starting too jump higher then me and i started losing bounce and he came back down the same time as me, but he had more bounce, which made me bounce a lot higher then i normally could also he weighed more then me. so i came back down and i landed on my back and the angle i was at on the trampoline shot me off. as i was bounced off the trampoline i thought i was gonna get hurt and i had rather gotten a few scratches then landing on a dogs manure, but that's just what happen i landed on a pile of dog manure and it really stunk my shirt up so bad, but after i took my shirt off i started jumping again and i jumped for that whole day about but i don't regret it it because after that everyone had a good laugh including me. so @caps story was a part of laughter and how laughter is a great way to have fun and even when it @month have been a bad thing that happen to you, maybe in the end it was funny even though at the time it was not.
40  @caps you ever been scared so much that you couldn't sleep the whole night? were you with a group of @num friends at the time? telling scary stories can be fun and games until someone gets too afraid and freaks everyone out. it starts out with everyone watching movies and having fun until the parents go up stairs and its time to party. it was called our  @caps @caps  night, we call it  @caps @caps  because, us @caps kids, we consider ourselves as @caps. our night involves @num antsy @location, @num frightened teenagers, and a house that has said to be  @caps .  to start this amazing night of terror, the guests had to arrive at first. everyone reached at my house around @num pm. we started out by playing videos games, laughing, having a good time, eating, playing board games. just your average teenage party. that was, until the parents went upstairs to go to bed. once they were settled in bed and fast asleep, we brought out the  @caps or @caps  games. i bet you thought we were gonna be immature seedlings and play the unrated version didn't you? well, fortunately we are the @caps kids. just your normal  i @caps you to run around the house three times  or  @caps you ever kissed someone? . nothing unrated about that. after a while everyone just got bored of playing that redundant game, so we moved on to the next activity we were going to do which was to play sing-star on the @num, but @location brought the wrong cords over so we couldn't hook the console up. since that didn't turn out as planned, we started to chat and capture pictures of the @caps. since this was our  @caps @caps , it was definitely necessary to take some pictures of all of us together as a @caps. for our @caps role, it goes like this, i am the father, @person is the mother, @location is the cat, @person is the @caps, @person, @person, @caps and @person were my children, @person is my brother, @person is the strange atrocious woman, @person is the sister in-law, and @location is our cable guy. this is how we all considered each other in the @caps, so we all had to wear costumes that fit our personality traits for the photos. it took a while for everyone to concentrate and to stop bickering to each other, but we managed to cooperate and proceed with the photo shoot. after photos, it was time to fulfill our appetites. i ordered pizza ahead of time before my parents went to bed. we got @num different large pizzas. hawaiian, @caps @caps, @caps @caps, @caps, @caps @person, and @caps@number one by one, we all kept coming back for more. my  daughter  (@caps) dropped her pizza onto the carpet and left a hulking red stain. we all started to pother. @person got the cleaner, i got the rags, @person got the @caps, and @person got the camera. she thought it would be humorous to take pictures while we scrubbed for our life. after the mess was cleaned up, we stopped eating and placed everything else away. now it was @caps movie time. snuggled up onto the couch with @num people all clutched together is the  right  way to contemplate a @caps movie. the movie we chose was called the @caps. every one sitting on top of every one was fun until someone had to use the bathroom. then, that's when it all happened... when @person got up to use the bathroom, the @caps turned off, all the lights in the house shut down and we kept noticing shadows whisking across our living room walls. @caps started to cry, @location was complaining, @person wouldn't go to the bathroom, and i was freaking out. since none of the lights would turn back on, we all got in a circle on the carpet and started telling legitimately scary stories. most of them were genuinely honest, and the others were said to be myths. there was one story that @person portrayed about a possessed @caps that had no left leg and would go around terrorizing pedestrians. well, it just so happened that i had a @location that had no left leg and when we started telling that story my @location started to freak out and assail all of my guests. so i grabbed my dog whistle and commanded them to cease, and dismiss. after all of the commotion, my parents never woke up and we all scurried up to my room to continue our discussion of @caps stories. during the whole process of the @caps, the main lesson was that you can conquer any kind of fear as long as you @caps a sense of laughter and friends to back you up with it and that's what happened at the party. we were just hysterical about the whole situation and nobody ever left someone alone by themselves and always comforted them with laughter. by far i would @caps to say that was my favorite and most adequately funniest parties i @caps ever had.
36  @caps@number @caps@number @caps@number , @caps @caps @caps, and now even @caps ( @caps @caps @caps). laughter! some say it is the best median. it can brighten a cloudy day, cure a case of the blues, and even sooth a breaking heart.  on the other hand a simple sinker or soft giggle can break a heart to! i have had first hand experience listening to goofy squeals being thrown my way and not because i told a witty joke simply just for siting, siting in my @num grade class room and becoming the but of my pears jokes. before i go on with this story there are a few things @caps must know. let alone that all @num graders have a common undeniable erg to bring people down so they can build them self's up. i was a @num grader who's weight had reached the point at witch my doctors were telling me  @caps should look in to a weight loss program.  this news alone was crushing my self a steam and my class mates laughter soon brought me to tears. i can recall a particular @caps, perhaps one of the worst. i was on the buss and almost home when @num girls who i thought were my friends started laughing. little did i know it was me they were laughing at so i joined in what i thought, and what seamed to be some @caps giggling. suddenly they stopped, looked at me started whispering to each other then one of the girls blurted @caps between chuckles  @caps look like a beached wail! . she said this so @caps the whole buss herd and immediately burst in to side spiting laughter. i walked down the same street i walked down every day were the buss dropped me off. that day it seamed more gloomy then ever before. this is the day i decided i was never going to set foot on the buss again! it is encounters with laughter like this that broke my heart but also gave me a strong motivation towards loosing weight and regaining confidence. days, weeks, months, even years have passed scene that day in the @num grade. i'm @num pounds lighter, a varsity cheerleader and proved of who i am. the tables have turned for me in many ways. i am no longer the person who gets laughed at because of my weight, but some times i catch my self sometimes mindlessly cracking a joke or two at some one else expense. i can recall just the other day, i was with my best friend at the mall. she spotted this girl who was over weight and immediately started giggling and elbowing me in the side trying to draw my attention to her like she was some freak show. when i saw the girl my first reaction was a hideous @caps but just as soon as i did so i felt the same pain i felt when that buss full of my pears laughed at me. i immediately stopped, realizing the pain my laughter could have brought her. my self, i am a very funny person and will do just about any thing for a @caps. but when it comes to laughing at people and hurting there feelings this is were i draw the line because i know how it feels to be in there position and i hope that my story helps open the eyes of u and others to the harmful effects some laughter can have. so go ahead and @caps@number @caps@number @caps@number @caps @caps @caps, and even @caps just not at the expense of another persons feelings.
40   being with people that can always make you feel comfortable and be yourself around is most likely the best quality in a friend. everyone has their flaws; a friend can always look past them and find the good in the one that they trust. a friend can tell a joke and make you laugh until you cry. making someone laugh can always help when they think that it's not possible for their life to get any worse. laughter is the most valued gift that can be given. you know inside that it's making them happy just from seeing the smile on their face. there have been many times in my life where i have laughed so hard that i cried. there is truly no greater feeling in the world than knowing that you have people in your life that can cheer you up just by doing or even saying something so ridiculous that it just breaks you into a hysterical laughter. i laugh a lot throughout the day. when i don't, people get suspicious and they feel like there's something wrong with me. that's literally how much of a role that laughing plays in my life. laughing is my second language in life. there has been one time in particular in my life span so far that has made me laugh so hard that i cried tremendously hard. my friends were staying the @time at my house and we were just being boys. we did so many things that mad us question our sanity: we at hot sauce by the spoon full, we watched comedy shows, and we also ate ourselves sick. it was the time of a lifetime and we laughed through it all. while watching the comedy shows, we couldn't breath. we were laughing so hard! nothing could make me stop laughing; i would just keep replaying every joke in my head and i'd start laughing even more. i already hurt so much as it was when we were watching it from earlier. the comedian was a magician with words; the way he put them all together to just seemed like he was reading a sacred scroll from ancient times. i laughed and cried over and over again. i probably did that for ten minutes straight! it was unbelievable. making these life-long memories with my friends is something that i will never forget. i truly know how great i have it in my life; people would kill to be in my shoes and to get the love and support i get from my friends and family. all my experiences are the things i learn from, whether they're good or bad, i know that its all going to help me later in life to be able to make the right decision when it is presented to me. all the laughs i share with other people makes me know that they have had a good time throughout their day because they smiled and laughed with me. they made a point in my day great as well. being myself around them is great as well because i know that they're already accepted me into their lives and i don't have to try to be anyone else.  everyone laughs at some point or another throughout their lives no matter how much they deny it. i really don't even know why they would because what better feeling is there than being able to let out a little giggle every once in a while? i really don't think that there is any. i feel really honored that i have such amazing people in my life that always make it exciting and full of laughter and life. it shouldn't be any other way in my personal opinion. live life to the fullest; why would you want to live it any other way?
31  laughing makes you live longer. that's what i was told as a child. i think laughing is really important in life. and, in relationships. in my realationship with my sister @location, we laugh all day, everyday. and i think thats why we have most fun together. i laugh most when i'm with my homies. i remember one time i was with @person and we were just laughing so hard over nothing, thats something we do alot. i'm just a laughing person. everybody knows that. i think when i laugh it just takes everything thats bad right now, and none of that even matters. i have this one friend namd @person, and he was the kind of person that made me laugh no matter what kind of mood i was in. so because of that, he'll always be an important person in my life. one time me and @person were with this girl that was very quiet for some reason when she was with us, and i just straight up told her that she needs to talk, or laugh! or something. then she opened up and actually laughed about the funny things. see, if your with a bunch of friends, or people that your affiliated with it's not good to just sit there and not say or do anything, just be yourself. laugh about the things you think are funny even if other people dont kaugh about it. who cares. be you. i love, absoulutly love when babies laugh. when a baby laughs, to me it means that baby is gonna be a happy human. in movies and tv shows, sometimes i laugh. i just feel like if you laugh, your life will be way easier than just looking at the negative things. just be happy, and laugh every once and a while.  one time me and my sister @person stole a truck, well.. we asked the guy if we could use his truck for something and he said yeah, but we really didnt use it for anything.. we just wanted to drive. and, when we started driving, we were going so fast, and blasting loud music. it was hilarious, and now everytime we listen to that song we were blasting, we just crack up laughing. so, when you make good memories and later in life think about the memories, or they get brought up somehow.. it's funny to just sit there and reminise. i could tell you a thousand stories. heres one. one time, me and @person were living with our good friend @person, and we were under his table pretending we were in a space ship, it was so, so, so, much fun! i'll never forget that time. and even when i'm writing this i still laugh about these stories. one time me and my sister @person were skating downtown, and i was trying to do this one trick, i think it was a tre' flip? anyways, i tryed to do it and i fell on my butt. it hurt, but it was hilarious. and now everytime we pass that place where i fell, we just laugh about it. memories are fun, every memory that i have, i laugh when remebered. one time me and @person were hanging out with some cool people, and then we left and went to this girls house, and there we turned the music up all the way and just danced for like a hour, we have a video of it. that was really funny. in the video i'm mostly just laughing. 
40  laughter. we all need it. we need it @caps a reminder that @caps is hope for those who have perseverance, for those who strive not to better others, but for those who strive to better themselves. we need it @caps a reminder to live our dreams, instead of dreaming of living. and, in my opinion, most importantly, @caps a reminder that even though we @month make mistakes, @caps is still a chance for those who simply have the courage to seize it.   in the @date, my foster parents decided to go out for dinner. the children, of course, were not invited. we were to either stay home with the babysitter, or go to a friend's house. no one wanted to stay home, @caps @caps was nothing to do. one of my best friends, @person, was a single child living with her grandmother. i made a quick phone call and ten minutes later i was waiting for her grandmother to pick me up. it was about five in the @time, and i was to be back no later then nine. i had four hours, and it was two weeks before @caps. neither of us knew @caps to do with so much time on our hands. after all, we only saw each other for a few hours at school. this way new to both of us. we were both sophomores, and i had a crush on @location. this turned out to be a big problem, considering @caps knew this piece of information. @caps didn't have a problem with it, but @person, her boyfriend, did. we got along, but he didn't like the fact that i was spending so much time with her, especially while he wasn't @caps. he trusted me to take care of her though, so he didn't make a huge deal out of it.   we had decided to set up the @caps tree first, and go from @caps. we both had @caps, so just about everything on the tree was shiny. tinsels, ornaments, pictures, @caps name it. it took about twenty minutes to get everything set up, not including the time it took to unpack all the decorations. it looked magnificent when we were done. i'd help make some pretty @caps looking trees, but this was by far the best. i was proud of our work. i didn't have much in my life to appreciate, so this was one of those things that normally wouldn't matter, but suddenly became really important. we admired our work for a few minutes and then went down to the den. @person got on the @caps to talk to @person for a bit, while texted my girlfriend. i was in the process of preparing myself to break up with her.   @person and i had been together for most of my sophomore year, and i was beginning to regret it. our relationship had started when one of my buddies, @person, and hers ended. i know this sounds bad, but i really didn't want to be with her at first. i was putting myself between @person and her so that they would stop fighting so much. now i was starting to see why he broke up with her in the first place. @caps was like a bad drug that got @caps really high, and then dropped @caps like a rock. @caps was extremely controlling. @caps wasn't @caps for me, and @person had finally convinced me that enough was enough. after i broke up with @person, i felt both happy, and depressed. i was happy that i could be free, but i was depressed because i felt so alone. i'd never been @caps at getting close to people, so this was hard for me to do.   seeing me so roughed up didn't sit well with @person. @caps knew me much better then most people, so @caps knew that i needed help quick. @caps did something so subtle, that to most it would have seemed unimportant. @caps took one look at me, got up from the computer, and gave me a long hug. at first i didn't think it was a @caps idea. her boyfriend was very protective of @person. he didn't like guys getting close to her, under any circumstances.    @caps @caps please just try to relax for a minute? your making me nervous.  @caps said in that tone that meant it was more of an order then a question. maybe it was the fact that i was in such a bad mood that this seemed like the funniest thing in the world to me. i started laughing really hard.    @caps. that wasn't so hard, was it?  @caps @caps pulled away from the embrace, i kissed forehead; our way of saying  your beautiful.     @caps @caps going to be okay?  @caps asked in a worried voice.    @caps, i'll be fine. thanks @person.     @caps. @caps never showed me that guitar thing.     @caps guitar thing?     @caps said @caps played guitar.  @caps then i realized that i might not ever get another friend @caps @caps @caps this one.    @caps @caps. come on. i'll show @caps how to play @caps man. 
36  as people have bonded over the years, those bonds have been streanthend by laughter, joy, and trust. all of these are imporntant but they all work together to build these bonds. for normal people to enjoy one another they must have fun and fun begins with laughter. laughter comes from the brain and if two people think in the same thing as being funny, it brings them together with their similar intrests.  by telling a funny joke or being a person who always ends up with a smile on his or her face, brings people around more easily. since i was young i've always been a real happy kid and one who is easy to be around. i believe i am like this because my parents have always told me,  people that are happy are the ones people want to be.  @caps by being a seemingly happy person it has given me the friends i have. although i have never really understood what it ment because it could mean many differant things.  when ever i'm with my friends, looking back on it now, we are always laughing or joking about something. we could be laughing about ourselfs, or we could be laughing at a random person on the street. we could be doing absloutley nothing and be laughing at something stupid, but still be having good times. it @month be starting an argument that is funny to us. if someone starts saying stupid stuff, then one of us will jump on the chance to make him sound as stupid as possiable. most of the time we wont get butt hurt about it, but alot of the time we will take it to far. with all the laughter we have shared before it keeps us friends. stupidity and pain are probly the top two reasons why we laugh. stupidity would be if some one says something that doesn't make sence or came in at the wrong time. i have never under stood why we laugh at pain, maybe it is because we are glad that it is not us in pain,although sometimes it is, but maybe it is because we know that they will get over it. when someone is hurt badly, and another person is laughing about it alot of the time i will see them get angry because they are being made fun of for their pain. they need to just realize that it is funny for people to get hurt and know that they laugh at it too. laughter will always bring people to relationships. it show common intreasts and what people can tolerate from others. laughter is the main component to bringing happiness into peoples life, with out happieness and laughter this world would be supper boring.
33  my friend @person and i have @caps friends from as back as sixth grade. we have @caps through so much together. even though we don't have everything in common and we don't hang out, out side of school together, we have a lot of laughter in our friendship. i say that if you are gonna have a friendship that is gonna last, you have to have laughter in it to make it a fun friendship. when @person and i where in @num grade, we where the biggest people to the sixth graders because we where in the highest grade in our middle school. we would have so much stuff to do. @person and i would always walk down the hallways linking our arms together and one moment after another she would just push me into someone. that someone would plow into a locker or wall and we would just laugh are butts off. it was fun to us but the other people kinda minded, but not that bad.  another thing we would do to make our self laugh would be when @person and i would have big tickle fights. it would always start with one of us trying to stick something in each others mouths. i would always try to stick a piece of paper in her mouth and to get me to stop, @person would tickle me. @person new that i'm like the ticklish person on the face of the planet. one time that happened was when we where in front of the office at our school. we tickled and tickled each other till we where laughing our butts off on the flour. well a teacher came and told us to stop and then the bell rang and so we just went to our classes. well @person was the office aid and so when she went to the office, apparently one of the office people saw us tickling each other and thought we where going out. @person told me that she just said  @caps  and started to chuckle. i got a big laugh out of that. laughter is a vary good thing to me because without it, @person and i wouldn't be best friends as we are today in @num grade. you see, our friendship all started off of laughter. i met @person in the sixth grade @caps class. our teacher had assigned seats and @person and i and two other people had to sit together. i had no idea who she was at the time. we ended up saying something and laughing about it and soon enough she introduced her self and so did i. well the seating arrangement changed and she sat somewhere ells and so did i. well the person she sat by moved away. i had a bad grade in @caps class and i told my teacher i wasn't getting along with the people at my table and asked if i could sit somewhere ells. he told me yes and so i went over and asked @person if i could sit in the empty chair that the guy used to sit in before he moved away. she told me that she didn't care and so then on out we started hanging in school together and had so much fun.  so you see. laughter is a grate deal in a lot of peoples life's. you need it. without it i would of never made my best friend who i have today. i have her to thank for getting me through my tough years. without the laughter in this world we would be lost probably. just think about what you might not have or what you might be missing if you didn't have laughter in your life.
40          the @caps of laughter in @caps @caps me laughter is important, we all laugh in our lives. it's a symbol of happiness, and it shows people around us that we care enough @caps listen and pay attention. with laughter we can create memories that last a lifetime. for my friends and i, laughter comes naturally and we all enjoy every moment of it. my friend @person and i have known each other since the second grade and have been friends ever since. what has kept our @caps strong and still alive today, is the memories we have created through laughter. one memory i always seem @caps remember though, is the first time we had gone inner-tubing together.   there have been many memories made between @person and i that we remember because of the laughter we shared. yet the memory that always remains dominate, is when we had gone inner-tubing for the first time. it was our seventh grade @date and we had planned on spending as much time as possible together. now this did not really work out because i had @caps babysit a lot, but she was a good friend and understood. so when we did hang out it was always so much fun. now yes, we have had our up's and down's, and that comes with any @caps. we got through it and ended up having one of the best summers together. that @date we would hang out at each others house's and go places together. then one day @organization's parent's had decided that they wanted @caps take a trip @caps the lake and go boating. @person's family invited me @caps come along, and so i asked and i was able @caps go with their family @caps the lake. i had been boating before, and @caps the lake that we were going too. what i was not expecting, was for @person and i @caps go inner-tubing. it was exciting, and nerve-racking all at the same time; i had never laughed so much with @location in my life.going inner-tubing turned out @caps be one of the best memories we had ever made together. during the entire @date whenever possible,we had gone inner-tubing, for me, the adrenaline was almost addicting. laughing was almost always constant when boating because we just had the best time. it was our new story @caps tell everyone and we were both proud of it. when inner-tubing we had learned @caps work together and it helped our @caps a lot in a way. also when inner-tubing we got @caps the point where we went as fast as possible and went as crazy as possible and we loved it.  that @date we made some of my most treasured memories, and we really owe it all @caps laughter. with laughter we can create memories that last a lifetime, and i am very grateful for that. if not for laughter i do not know where my @caps with @person would stand. and because of that, i believe that laughter is important in any relationship or @caps. it's a symbol of happiness and that is what makes life great.
36  seeing one of @caps best friends trip and hit his face on a screen door, was enough to make myself laugh. its was the @date after @caps @num grade year of school. i was having @caps friends @person, @person and @caps neighbor @person stay the night at @caps house. @caps ever we got bored we usually went around @caps neighborhood  @caps @caps @caps  some houses to have some fun.  @caps @caps @caps  is @caps @caps quietly sneak up to someones front door, ring the door bell a couple times and then @caps run away. all four of us were hanging out that day. it was a great @date day, gorgeous sun, warm temperature and a nice gentle breeze to cool off your face.@caps it came to night fall we were all in @caps room playing @caps @num.   i'm bored bro,  @person said to the other three of us.   @caps then, think of something to @caps, @caps replied   i can't think of anything,  @person stated with a bored look on his face. we sat for a while thinking of something to @caps to entertain the four of us.  i got it!  i said with a confident smirk , lets go @caps @caps @caps!    i down for that , @person said  @caps me too , @caps and @person replied shortly after @person. as we were walking out @caps front door @caps mom shouted , where are @caps boys going?  @caps mom caught me off guard. i didn't know what to say , uh, we are going on a walk , i replied hesitantly.   @caps be safe,  @caps mom said as i walked out of the door. we @caps @caps ditched a couple house, but that was starting to get boring and then it hit me like a typhoon. i came up with the best idea i have thought of yet.   @caps this is what needs to happen, i'm going to @caps @caps @caps the first house, @person @caps get the next one, @person @caps get the house at the corner and @person will run around the corner to get the last house.    @caps @caps think that will work?  @person asked.   @caps@number yes it will work!  i said, @caps @caps ready?     i guess so ,  @person replied shortly after @person and @person yes. we all lined up in place. i rang the first door bell and started running, then i saw @person slam his clinched fist on the second door, next i didn't see @person ring the door bell because he was already running ahead of me.   @caps get the last house!  i shouted at him. the house @caps was running to did not have their porch light on. @caps was running fast to the house and failed the see the step up in front of the door. i didn't expect what happened next. smack! @caps tripped over the step up and hit his face on the screen door. i could hear the slam from the middle of the dark street.  he got up quickly and turn to us in confusion , should i ring the door bell? should i ring it?    @caps run @caps i'm sure they would hear @caps smack their screen door with your face!  @caps we got back to @caps house everyone was laughing. @caps @caps made our night. that happened @num years ago and i still remember it like it happened yesterday. so next time one of your friends ask @caps to  @caps @caps @caps  a house think about if the porch lights are on. 
45   @caps!  @caps society today loves laughter. from comical shows to hilarious friends, people have fun convulsing with glee. not to mention that when you're doubled over with laughter you are getting an amazing workout. everyone that texts @month use  @caps  or  haha  to show they think something is funny; but it is nothing compared to actually being with friends and having,  a smile that burst.   i couldn't wait. i was on the coast at a camp with my friends, and we were about to head-up to walk up to the three crosses. some of the other girls were asleep and we had to leave quietly. one of the girls tripped as we were walking out the door and it took all we had to not burst out in laughter. because when she tripped, she barely caught herself, as she was about to fall on sleeping @caps. jasmine scurried out the door with the rest of us. after the door was closed, we all doubled over laughing. jasmine's face, when she tripped was priceless.  we headed into the crisp air without looking back. from a gravel path to the cement road going up the hill, we happily skipped along. as the hill got steeper, we started walking. jasmine, after being tired from skipping, almost fell again. everyone started laughing again. the walk up the hill was taking longer than expected. finally, we could see the three crosses at the top.  when we arrived at the crosses, we waited for the miraculous sunrise. we kept staring at the ocean; waiting with anticipation. eventually, @caps pointed out that the sun rises on the east and would we coming over the mountains. again, all the girls laughed because we were so tired we forgot which side the sun rose on. at last, the astonishing sunrise happened. it was full of pink, purples, yellows and oranges. after watching the sunrise we realized we still had the treacherous walk back down the hill. i peered over the edge and saw a little path. with a bunch of convincing, i got all the girls to walk down the steep hill because it looked shorter than the cement road we came up.  the first part of the path was simple. as we started heading farther down the hill it got skinnier with more brush. a couple of the girls thought we should head back up, but i convinced them otherwise. so on we went.  @caps no!  @caps yelled. we turned to see she had managed to let her shoe fall of into a blackberry bush. she had just gotten her shoes the day before and now they are muddy and lost. everyone was trying to reach it, but it was just a little too far away. suddenly, @person tried to grab the shoe; immediately she fell into the blackberry bush! @person forgot about her shoe for a little and started doubled over with laughter again. while flailing and screaming we yelled for her to stop because if i didn't mention this earlier; this is a very steep hill. while she was in the bush, she grabbed @person's shoe. the hard part was getting @person out.  the first time we tried to pull her up; we got her up a couple of inches then she fell back down, into the bush. finally, after what felt like a million tries, we pulled her big butt out of the bush. everyone was laughing so hard during the extravaganza. @person was super embarrassed. after all of that, we headed down the hill. we still had giggles while trotting down the trail. as we went, we saw animal tracks. we then realized the trail was most likely made by animal. a couple girls joked around about being terrified of the animal tracks. eventually, we got back to the cabin, still laughing about what had taken place. the rest of the day everyone was happy and giggly for waking up with an amazing morning.  laughter helped the girls have a wonderful rest of the day. laughter helped us work through the mud, the shoe losing, and the cold. with out it, we could have been very grumpy. also, having amazing friends to laugh with was phenomenal. laughing helps people be happy; being happy is better than being sad; therefore, laughter is important. when writing this paper to the @organization's in @location, i told my friends about the adventure we went on and the predicament we got ourselves into. they laughed hysterically, since they knew the girls. laugh often to be happy.
36   laughter is the shortest distance between two people.   @caps best friend @person. wow! all those great times last @date and all the ones to come. some people think were weird but if you knew us you would understand. sometimes people say,  i'm going to die laughing.  @caps i know i am because of @person, she knows how to always make me laugh. if i had to count how many times we've laughed about or done together i could there isn't enough time or numbers to tell you how many times.  first of all, this friendship started the @date, and now we are in sophomore @date of high school. we've been friends for one @date and eleven months and six days. we are the best of best of friends.  so last @date when we were learning the cheers for football season, all most every-time we got done with a cheer, @person @person and i would say,  @caps-in @caps.  that was our saying, and we always did it @date and after the football or basketball games. we called it our @caps-in @caps style or for short our slogan. we would be having a blast and laughing for hours.   @caps turn, @caps turn,  in @date we were on our way to state for cheer. on the car ride up to @location, every-time we took a corner we would say what corner it was and do a motion with it. oh @caps goodness we laughed and we had a blast. after the @caps and @caps turns, there was another motion we called the monkey and we would act like monkeys. it was so much fun we laughed. we also laughed so hard that we were crying and we had to go pee so bad, it was almost really bad.that was one of many car rides that was amazing.  on the other hand, @person @person and i, cheer together, we have sleepovers, @caps i should say that we do everything together. she is @caps cheer sister and will always be, also she is @caps best friend.i would do anything for her. i love @person @person.  in addition, to the we do everything together. when @person is over at @caps house i always have to make sure i make sandwiches and orange juice. because this one time we stayed up past midnight and we were hungry so i went and made all of that and @person loved it so now i have to make sure i have some for her when she comes over. now we always talk about the becomes of the sandwich habit.b we laugh about it all the time.  finally, @person @person and i are going to be together forever, because i don't know what i would do with out @caps sister. i would not be the person who i am today with out her she and everything to me we laugh even when we want to cry she is everthing to me. you could say we have a perfect freindship of all time. @caps bestfriend is @caps sister i love you @person, thanks for alays having @caps back.                                             
42  everyone loves to laugh; i don't think everyone understands the effect laughter can have on two people though. for example, there can be two complete strangers, who have never seen each other before in their life; as soon as they start laughing they could become good friends. you'll never know how close you can be with someone if you don't ever sit down and talk, laugh, and get to know them. you could go your whole life being at @caps with just a minute amount of friends but then there could be @num other classmates you've never talked to that could also become your friends, too. i'm sure just getting to know one another would make a difference in someones life because for me there has been many situations where laughing has made an impact on my relationship with someone; especially with my best friend, @person. when i first met my friend @person we didn't know each other at all but laughing broke the ice. a simple laugh made us comfortable and everything was less awkward. as soon as we started laughing more and more, we couldn't stop; the rest was history. i went to elementary @caps with @person for @num years and never talked to her but then when we got into @num grade we started hanging out with the same people and started talking more. by @num grade we began to hang out outside of @caps and talking, sharing secrets, and having sleep overs. but  breaking the ice  isn't the only impact laughing can have on a relationship. when i'm with @person, i know i can trust her and everything is fun. we always have conversations to talk and laugh about. you could say it made us closer. by the time @num grade came we were best friends, we had sleepovers every single weekend at one anothers house. when the @date before our @num grade year at the @caps @caps came we were spending weeks at each others houses. there wasn't a day that went by that we weren't together, talking, or making plans over the @date to hang out. now, we can be ourselves around each other; we can always have a good time. making people closer is just a small part of the effects that just one laugh can do to two people. when i'm sad about something @person makes everything better; also vise versa; i make her feel better, too. we always have each others back. i know we will always be there for each other; i'll always have a shoulder to cry on. we have become such close friends that when @person was having problems at home she needed a place to live in order for her to not have to go to the @caps @caps @caps @caps, so she moved in with me! it has been the most fun living with her. we thought we would start to argue and not be as close since we would always be together and probably get annoyed of each other but we haven't. @person and i can hang out @num and always be together; it's like having another sister.  @person and i are super close, and she plans to stay living with me for the rest of @caps @caps until we graduate. it's amazing to think us being best friends and tremendously close, living together, always being together, and being totally comfortable with each other on everything just started out with a simple laugh when we first started talking in the @num grade. this is why i believe that just laughing can make two strangers, that have never even spoken, can turn into being the closest of friends.
40  one @date @time back in @date a couple of friends and i were beyond bored. nothing seemed fun to do. @caps to a movie, @caps to get some food, not even call of @caps sounded entertaining. @location parents told us to go do something outside. before leaving his house he slips into his pantry and grabs two hefty rolls of @caps wrap.  i think i have an idea  @caps @person as we walk away from his house. i have no clue where we're walking to. @person just keeps saying  follow me.  we all follow in a pack down the street until we show up at @organization.   cold and confused, we sit in the parking lot of the @organization waiting for all cars to be gone. once all the cars are gone @person informs us on what we are doing here. he tells us of something he did with his cousins awhile back. you have three people on the roof of @organization's @organization scoping out the road and you have four @caps.  @caps?  i question @person with a dumb-found look on my face.  @caps, @caps  @caps @caps are the people who will be putting the @caps wrap across the street. the plan is when no cars are coming in the distance, we hop the fence and put @caps wrap across the street so cars drive through it and stop.  @caps sounds fun, but uh what happens when the @caps stops before the @caps wrap and takes it down?  @caps @caps, looking down on the whole operation.  @person laughs a little bit and @caps  @caps@number then it will be an inconvenience for the driver.  @caps wrapping roadways sounded a lot for fun then black ops so we were all down.  everyone gets in position. mark, @person, @person and myself are down by the roadway in a secluded area by some bushes. while @person, @caps and @person are posted up on the roof giving us updates about the oncoming traffic. we get a call from @caps saying that it is clear for awhile. i hang up the phone, tell the guys and @date up from the ground. we all get over the fence in quick time and start a first layer of @caps wrap. i get another call. it's @caps saying that there are three cars are almost to our location. we drop the @caps wrap in the bush and get back over the fence. the @caps comes up close and it's a cop. of course. we all just stay hidden down in the bushes while the cop takes our huge roll of wrap. we are only left with one more roll , which should before enough.  @caps calls again and @caps it's clear. we go out again and start to set up the prank. we wrap it around @num times and make it as tight as it possibly could be. perfect.   @caps incoming! go! go! go!  yells mark while trying to get over the fence. we all make it over in time and go prone in the field. laying there anxiously someone whispers  here it comes.   the @caps slams on it's breaks, and the driver gets out. he looks at @caps wrap in disgust and looks around for the kids responsible. @caps lets out a big  hahaha  from the roof that even we can hear perfectly. the guy walks up the fence looks around a bit more and mutters for foul words under his breath. he didn't even bother continuing through, he just got in his @caps and backed up. @caps my god dude that was hilarious!  i say with a wide grin on my @num @caps and @person come dashing through the field with a scared expression on all of their faces. @caps!  yells @caps scurried into different directions. mark, @person and i jolt over the fence and hide in the play structure for awhile. while the rest of the boys are booking it to a safe haven. we eventually all meet back up at @location house without getting  caught  by the authorities.  it's nights like @caps were laughter really plays a key role between a big group of friends like i have. the laughing and running makes us closer as a group. it brings us together.
34  laughter is a sign of good relationships. to some people it's a sign of personality, sign of love and also a sign showing someone that you care.  to me laughter is what makes people so unique. everybody has a different kind of laugh. for example, when you are a baby @caps laugh is high pitched. the older you get the lower @caps laugh becomes,  like @organization @organization . if it was not for his laugh would not be who he is. when i was a child i remember trying to laugh like just like @organization did. i would be walking around the house trying to get my laugh really @caps. my family though it was the best thing ever. they would ask me to laugh like @organization @organization so they can get a laugh also.  now today my laugh is what i wanted it to be,  @caps . it is hard for me to laugh quietly now. i have had some people tell me things like;  @caps laugh is what i will remember you by  or  @caps laugh is really something else . i love my laugh because it is part of who i am. with out laughter you, me, or anybody else wont be they are now. laughter is one way to show emotion. so go ahead and try different kinds of laughs. no matter what you can not change the one you were meant to have.
32  in my storie i am going to tell you about a funny time in my life where me, and my brother liked to pull pranks on my aunt.   @caps first paragraph is about the first prank that we pulled on my aunt. when i was about six and my brother was four and my aunt had just bought a beautiful purple suade couch, she loved @caps couch, and me and my brother at the time thought that my aunt had loved @caps couch more then she loved us. so me and my little brother took two jugs of chocolate syrup, and poor them all over my aunts brand new three thousand dollar couch.    the second prank was just myself, and one day i was playing video games and my aunt was getting ready for work. i was getting very frustrated with the game and i threw my controller down, man my aunt ran over and pop me in the back of my head so fast,and she told me to be a good sport and try it again. but i was upset because i just got popped in the back of my head so i was looking for some revenge, when my aunts goes into the bathroom to go put in her make-@caps for work, i go into the kitchen and get a grape soda, i walk over to my aunts purse crack open the grape soda and poor it all over the inside of my aunts purse.  the last paragraph is about the worst prank that me and my little brother have ever pulled. one morning when my aunt was at work and my dad was sleep, me and my little brother were sitting on the couch watching television and my little brother says that he has to go to the bathroom and knowing us kids we do everything together so me and my brother go @caps stairs to the bathroom, and we see the biggest box of fifty-four rolls of soft, lushes toilet paper.me and my little brother love toilet paper rolls for whatever reason, so we open the box and my brother drops one in the toilet, so i put one in the toilet, then he puts another one in the toilet, then i flush it. little did we know that it would back fire at us and the toilet started to over flow, but i kept flushing. then i get another roll and start unwrapping it all over the floor, the my brother gets one and @date we are knees deep in toilet paper and water. then our aunt walks through the front door, we don't here her because we are having so much fun in toilet paper and water, then she comes @caps stairs, goes to the bathroom too see me and my brother and a bathroom thrashed, full of toilet paper and water. but the only thing that she says to us is. clean @caps @caps @caps @caps! she slams the door then me and my brother look at eachother then start cleaning. then finally after hours of cleaning the bathroom is back to the way it should be.   @caps is the conclusion of my storie about the three worst pranks that me and my little brother have pulled on our aunt.   
34             the element of @caps and laughter laughter is an important element that a person could ever have when they are in a joyful or happy mood. laughing is a good part in a persons life; it shows other people when you appreciate something that they did that put you in a good enough mood to share a laugh. some people react in different ways when it comes to laughter because of their emotions; other people laugh to hilarious jokes and other types of people laugh at peoples accidents while others don't. emotions are a big deal in a persons life. some emotions are joy, sorrow, jealousy, fear or anger. being happy makes people want to laugh at something. sometimes when people laugh too much, they will actually start crying from it. people like other people @caps are in a happy or joyful mood, because then they can receive those good feelings as well; therefore, it makes other people happy to get more people to be in a positive attitude as well.  another thing that makes people laugh are jokes. some jokes can be very funny, other jokes can be gross, and some jokes can be really hilarious that you will always remember them. but jokes can get complicated at times; to a little kid you can say,  @caps, @caps!   @caps's there?   @caps.   @caps @caps?   @caps @caps?, don't cry about it, it was just a joke,  and the kid would be laughing. but to someone @caps is older, you have to think a little more to get them to laugh. people love laughter; they like laughing at peoples jokes and especially at hilarious pranks. sometimes pranks really aren't that funny. like you seeing a friend of yours get something that spits out garlic and them knowing that the person that is about to get pranked is alergic to garlic. but most of the time, funny things help people cheer up when they are down. furthermore, accidents are some things that can be really horrible at some times, but at other times, some of the accidents that occur in life can be very hilarious to some people. some accidents people can decide whether to take it one way or the other. for example, a person might think that another person that is about to jump off of a diving board, but then slips and hits his back on the board is really funny and another person could disagree with that and take it in the opposite way and think that it was not funny at all. it is like when someone says that they a really funny joke or something hilarious to say, and you end up thinking that it was something that was bothersome or a tragedy or it could also be the other way around. you might think that you have something funny to say, but then to your friend it was something that really bothered them or something that they thought that wasn't funny at all. in other words, laughter is an important element that a person could ever have in their life. it is a part that a person can help another person when someone needs a good laugh to share with another person. enjoy having good times with friends to share a couple of laughs, don't just be in a grumpy mood all the time, be happy. laughter is a good thing; people love it so don't always be serious and at least share some laughs with your friends or loved ones.
40                  laughter at its @caps  laughter is one ability that everyone in the world has. not only does it help you make more friends, but it can also turn your day all the way around. the capability to laugh is a huge importance in this world. without laughter, days would be dull, sad, and somewhat depressing. when i see someone laugh, it brightens my day, makes me smile, and causes me to laugh along with them. by laughing we become happier, learn more about others, and make our bad days better. i have experienced, first hand, the joys laughing can bring after i have had a bad moment, and that is why i believe that laughter is extremely important to have and to keep in your life.  not everyone can have a great day all the time. bad days occur, and when they do, seeing one funny incident and laughing about it is what can turn the whole day around and make it great. many people hear the statement,  laughter is the shortest distance between two people,  or a statement similar to that one and will never agree with it. often times we will scoff and disagree completely. it turns out that i used to be one of those people myself. most days were not the @caps they could be, plus having to go to school all day long ruined it a little more. people kept telling me that if i laughed once in a while then i might feel better more often, and i @month actually have fun when i participated throughout the day. i never believed them, and why should i? how could one action as simple as laughing change the way i feel about everyday life? the possibilities were just to unlikely. i didn't think i'd change my views on it either, until a few years ago.  it started off like any usual day would, not so great. my hair was a mess, my sister @person and i could not stop fighting, and my brand new phone broke right as we started our shopping trip to @location. i had decided that the day was going to be horrible because so far, nothing had worked out well. as the day went on, nothing worse happened, but nothing better did either. @person and i kept traveling around, going to stores, and shopping. finally, at our last stop we saw a situation occur. as we were sitting at a stop light, waiting for traffic to move, i spotted a strange man sitting across the road all by himself. the man looked as though he had an injury on his foot, and our suspicions were confirmed when he began walking like a hurt penguin would, barely shuffling his feet and bobbing up and down as he moved forward. the sight of this man made me smile, and when i pointed him out to @person she started laughing uncontrollably. then i too, began cracking up. the man with his crazy way of walking had made me laugh had proceeded to turn my entire day around. what i thought was impossible turned out to be the exact opposite, possible. laughing could bring you closer to others and make your day more amazing.  as a result of my trip with my sister that day, my views and beliefs about laughing were changed greatly. laughter actually was the shortest distance between two people. even though my little sister and i were arguing before the funny man came, after we were done laughing about him we realized that in the span of a few minutes we had become closer than ever before. it is crazy to think that one incident can change your mind about some of your strong beliefs, but it happened, and that day is now a memory that i am going to keep with me forever. i'm happy it happened because as a result of it i have begun to think differently about laughter and the effect it can have on certain situations in my life. i now think of laughter as one of the greatest pastimes to have and do it quite often.
31                      laughterlaughter can change a lot in people,it can bring people together. it can also help with relationships to make the other person laugh is always a good thing. @caps your with your friends laughter can and will always be there, well i know it is with my friends and i. @caps your in a relationship or a friendship, @caps able to laugh with that other person is important because it can make you feel more connected to them,@caps you have a big group of friends that you just met you can all laugh together that's even better because then you know your getting somewhere.  my best friend and i laugh all the time, @caps can just look at me in a way i only understand and i'll know what @caps means, and then we both start laughing @caps we stand in a big group of friends and we start laughing, they all look at us funny. then normally we tell them what were laughing about, most of the time they don't get it. my best friend and i are always together,besides school, we are always laughing no matter if its something that happened a day ago or a year ago. my best friend and i have a lot of inside jokes,we only have to bring one time of hanging out and if something funny happened we will start laughing about it again. in a relationship as in having a  boyfriend  or  girlfriend  one of the plus sides of things are to make them happy, and laugh, and love to be around you. my boyfriend does it to me, no matter if i'm not in a good mood he always tries to put a smile on my face, most of the time it works. @caps you have a boyfriend or girlfriend you always wanna try and make them happy. that means girls don't get over the stupid little things. boys don't get mad @caps they want to hang out with there friends.  the best way to have a relationship with your boyfriend and your best friend is to make sure they don't hate one another, and if they do work it out in a way that you could hang out with your boyfriend one day and your best friend the other. my relationship works out amazing, because my best friend is dating my boyfriends best friend, so we can all hang out if we really wanted to and not fight it's nice to have all of us friends, that way we can go to the coast together and we can go out to dinner as a group. at this time we are thinking about planning a trip to the coast, and going there for a day were not totally sure though.  i think the best way to have a good relationship full of laughter is to make it your all. just don't give your whole life to your boyfriend or girlfriend cause if you ever break up you won't have any friends, cause they won't want to hang out with you anymore because you left them for your boyfriend at the time. so i always try and tell my boyfriend that with out making it sound the wrong way. normally the guys understand that you have a life too and it doesn't revolve around them. my friend did that once and @caps was not happy as all in the relationship,@caps told me they never laughed together or anything,@caps was afraid to break up with him though cause @caps would not have any friends,cause @caps made him her life.  laughter can always make you feel better, it'd kinda like a healing process it will always be there, its just a matter if someone can make you laugh. theirs people that can make you laugh and @caps and videos and family. @caps your with someone that makes you happy it is like you full of joy and enjoyment to be around them and you care for them and you feel comfortable around them. if you have struggles and get through them and they still make you laugh and happy you will know that they are the one your happy and can laugh around. family always makes you laugh weather you don't want to or not, i love my dad he always knows how to make me laugh. 
38 when i was younger my sister and i would fight all the time. it would either be verbally or physically. whatever we fought about we would drag on for hours. not only would we get more upset as time went on, but my mom and family members got fed up. it didn't help that there was only @num months between us. it would make everything ten times more tense. my mom had a few tactics to try to get us to stop. one would be grounding us. but we shared a room so that would only make it worse. another was giving us chores which took up both our time and was annoying , the last one was making us sit criss cross apple sauce, face eachother, and hold hands. we hated this one. but every time that we did it we would end up cracking up and forgetting what we were even fighting about. after we did this we would give eachother a hug and move on. the laughter brought us closer and always helped to fix things.
37  laughter? what is laughter? well laughter is a contagious disease which is passed around by a group of people from one to the other, ( @caps speaking) and should be included in every persons life while they are growing up. here is a true story of how laughter played a key part in my life as a kid. my @caps has five days of laughter as i call them, that we all celebrate through out the year: birthdays, @location, the @date of @date, @caps , and @caps. on my birthday the whole @caps gets together at my grandparents house to celebrate the day i was brought into this world. usually a couple of days before my birthday my mom grants me the authority to invite some of my friends to come over to go see some event or go to the arcade. then when we get home we all stay up late playing video games and watching movies.  when @location finally decides to greet us with its colorful eggs and candy, my @caps meets at my uncles house to hide the eggs for us children to find. which we always seem to miss at least one every year. while we are finding the eggs our parents are taking them and hiding them again. when we first noticed, it was when my uncle was climbing the willow tree in the back yard and placing the eggs back in the spots where we found them. then watching him try to climb down again. when that is all over we play a game of hid-n-seek. which is kinda hard to win when there is fourteen people hiding over a one acre lot. on the @date every one has their own agenda that they fallow. my dad and me go to @location, @organization to light @caps on the third of @date for @caps @caps @caps. while waiting for the show to start we play a game of laser tag which ends up being a big game of around fifty people or so. then on the @date my dad does his own show in the back yard for us kids which is really exhilarating to watch.  then comes my favorite laughing day @caps. my dad sets up his house as a haunted house. which is fun since we all get painter and shot up with silly string being flung at us from unseen sources. when we go trick or treating i am usually a solider with a @caps gun unloaded and fully camouflaged, which makes for an interesting night when they cant find me even though i am right beside them. later when we get back home it is a competition to see who got the most candy, i usually win because i get to stay out later than my siblings do. well then, now for the holiday that wraps up all other holidays @caps! a time of gift giving and receiving. mostly receiving for me. we all have a dish we cook and end up with part of that dish on me or whoever dares to enter the kitchen when i am cooking. after every one gets done eating we sit down and commence the opening of the presents in order from youngest to oldest. then it is a free for all for your own presents until the adults but in and make us go in order again. its funny to watch them when they are chasing my cousin around the house because he took a present from them. so that is my story of what a year of laughter is for me in a nut shell. that is why laughter should be in everyone's life as they are growing up. it relaxes and builds relationships at the same time. like a saying my grandparents used to say to us kids when we were sad  a laugh a day will keep the @caps@number at @location .
25  my newest botfriend and i have been dateing for well almost @num months on @date it will be a year. we have a lot of fun together we talk about anything we dont rreally ride bikes or go jogging we have just started to work out togther. my parents love him they call him there son in law i think its kinda cute.. but anyways we had a blast on new years eve and we were hanging out with one of joes friends his name is randy we were doing the normal thing hanging out bbqs everything. it was around like @time and we were ready to go to bed well randy had no idea that we were going to stay the night we nither did i but we did.. randy owns a hotel place out by grayback they had no extra beds in there house so we asked randy if we could use a hotel room he said yeah of coures. the @time day we had to pay him a little bit of money not all of it yet but some of it and we went to our hotel room.  me and @caps were looking at it and it had a big hot tube bath bed king size bed i jumped on it and it was the best. so @caps @caps on a pair of shorts and i @caps my bathing suit on we @caps inside the hot tube and had a blast :) well when i was trying to get out of the hot tube i slipped and i caught myself iam so glad that i did not fall on my face then @caps @caps out and did the same thing it was kinda funny but not really but at the same time it was. me and @caps were really hungry and all we had was a bag of chips and some cheese dip when @caps was eating the chip he was making this funny noise like the star wars person chubaka . it was the best time ever we @caps to watch sadalight t.v. i dont have that at my house so all we have to watch is dvds and maybe some vhs's but anyways we brought the @num with us. we were in the room playing this game called metal of honor it is kinda like a war game but with lots of gun we kinda had the t.v. up but i did not think it was that loud i guess the nehbordid. after about @num to @num mintues we heard a knock on the door it was the nehbor he was asking if everything was ok cause he heard loud noises and gun shots coming from the room we said yeah of course everything is ok it is just a game that we have for the playstation sorry to bother sir i did not think it was that loud. so we did turn the t.v. down and we played the game for like @num hours so by the time we went to bed it was lik @num the @time moring i was so tired that @time day and i had to go to school that very @time day. we @caps up took a shower and whent back into randy's house we sat in there had breakfast i think we had bicuts and gravy it was the best i had a lot of fun then. after we had breakfast then we went home and we ate some more at my house it was like around @num we decited that we were going to take a little nap and we winded up sleeping untill the @time day. @caps and i @caps up at @num and we could not fall asleep sp we stayed up playing the video game for like @num hours and i had to get up and go to school i went inside my dads house and took a shower @caps ready for school then went out to my house and @caps dressed in to my school clothes brushed my hair brushed my teeth and then i @caps all my stuff together and relaxed then around @num@number i went out to my bus stop and waited for the bus when i reilized that no one was out there i went back into my house when @caps was laughing  i asked what are you laughing about he said that do you know today is @date and you don't have school i was like what that is crazy i thought i was @date he said no it is @date.i was the best new years of my life i hope to have another one like that and maybe if we are still together on my birthday we might do something just as fun hopefully. but i think we will @caps has treated me so well and i appreciate him and what he does for me. he also has been one of the best friends i have ever and hopefully we will betogether for a long time.
42  one of the most oddest things in life is how people can have different ways of doing things for just about anything. @caps what i see most is laughing. there is that laugh you do when you don't really understand your bosses joke and then there is that laugh that you do when it really isn't the  right time.  @caps one of my favorite is laughing at your best friend when your crying. sitting on the train a few weeks ago, i saw a lady with her friend sobbing about how her boyfriend just recently broke up with her. quietly turning over my shoulder i try to hear more of the story. her friend nodded and comfort her. @caps then said something about how gross it was when he ate. sort of like a cow eating grass. as soon her friend said this the girls face blushed and she giggled with laughter. @caps still her eyes were red as she sniffled a little. @caps a slow smile washed over her face. the woman had more of giggle then a laugh. @caps you could tell the girl was going to be okay because she had someone to make her laugh and remember life is more then just a guy. i thought for a second how this happens more then you think with my best friend. i feel like now even that seven years have gone by it never gets old when we bust out laughing. most of the time it's something stupid and we are just strangely thinking the same thing. @caps then there's other times where it will be like the lady's behind me. one of us is upset and we know the perfect thing to say to each other. friendship is like that. and laughter is the medicine to any problem.  after watching the two woman i turn in front of me seeing now a teenage boy and girl. the girl looks slightly nervous as she keeps smoothing her skirt out. then the boy who keeps shaking his knee up an down. and you can tell he's trying to think of something to say while he keeps taking quick sips from his water bottle. the girl finally pointed out the window and said something about when she was a girl she would play soccer there. he looked where she was pointing and said he thought he maybe played baseball there one time. she nodded her head and they got silent again. the train came to it's next stop jerking a little making the boy spill some of his water on his pants. the girl quickly pulled some tissues out of her purse giving them to the boy. his cheeks flushed with red as he started to chuckle and explaining how nervous he was and this wasn't going to help. the girl stared at him and quickly started to smile. then they both began to look at each other and started to laugh. the boys laugh was deep and echoed across the train the girls was contagious @caps sweet. now the ice had been broken because of one awkward moment and had them both talking and laughing. this was the start of could maybe be even young love. i smiled and rested my head on the window. watching the trees blur by. i knew how our world is always talked about being so melancholy @caps i think people forget moments like this. it's those brief seconds with another human relating to you. making you laugh and caring enough to try to make you feel better that keeps our world from completely going insane.  the train slams and starts to slow down as it comes to a stop. i slouch my bag on to my shoulder and get off the train. as i step outside i feel the cool air kiss my cheeks. i looked around see people hurry by me looking for their next bus or person to pick them up. i sit down on the bench and watched the teenage couple holding hands as they walk by me. as they smile and talk everything suddenly goes dark. i throw my hands up to my eyes connecting with another big cold hands. i snap around to see the person who had blinded me. it was my dad smiling ear to ear. i stood up on the bench and hugged him as i started to laugh. my laugh was high pitched @caps muffled in my dads coat. this was the best type of laugh to me. no action was funny or a friend saying something @caps because your so happy sometimes you just have to let out a little bit of joy. you just laugh, not for any reason @caps because your happy. and then in that second everything bad or what you stressed about goes away. maybe just for a little awhile @caps it's still something that could make your whole day better.
32 all of us now how to laugh and all of us probably have laughed at least once in our entire lives. but i never laughed as hard as i did the day my friend @caps and i were waiting for our friends @location, @person and @person to come back from getting @person from @location to come down and hang out for a little while. @person had to wait at my house for them to get back, on the way to my house i'm thinking what in the world am i supposed to do with @caps all alone? @person and i always have a lot of fun hanging out with each other but we always have people around when we do hang out, i anticipated when @person got there cause i couldn't think of what me and @person could do when we were at my house with out @person and @person being there. we couldn't hang out in the house because my @caps had a cold, so we had to go outside in to the shop which is also called a garage, and hang out together until @person and @person got @num finally showed up and i didn't feel as sick as i thought that i would when she got there, she got out of the car and came in, we went straight to the shop and got started on trying to find something to do, @person suggested that we sat down and just talked, i was up for anything as long as it was fun and didn't involve going anywhere at @num: @num @caps clock at night. i sat there and asked her about her life was she happy, did she hate living in @location and a lot of other stuff. but then the ultimate topic of conversations came up... t.v. commercials. we talked about all of our favorite @caps commercials and why they were our favorite, i told her my favorite commercials of all time were the freecreditreport.com commercials, the old ones not the new ones, and that the reason i loved them so much was because they had real life situations in them that made them very easy to believe but they were also sort of hard to believe cause i don't know anyone who has had to work at a restaurant dressed as a pirate because of identity theft, or someone who has had to buy a really cruddy car because their credit score was whack, and i've also never heard of a used sub compact? any-who @caps said that her favorite commercial was a car commercial that had dancing hamsters in it telling you which car would be the best choice to go with, @caps was describing the commercial to me and actually started dancing in the middle of my garage. it was quite funny but at the same time some what disturbing. @person is a really good friend even if she is a little goofy sometimes but the best thing about having @caps is knowing that when ever i need a really good friend i have @caps after the whole dancing bit i knew what i wanted to while @caps was there... i wanted to be crazy and hyper i wanted to be so full of energy the world fastest runner wouldn't be able to keep up with me! i went into the kitchen and downed some sugar and got about as hyper as @caps, only less, then the time almost flew by before we knew it @person, @location, and @person were there we couldn't believe it. @person got out of the car and the first person he gave a hug to was @person of course, then he gave me a hug, then @person, then @person. i hadn't seen @person in so long it was like we had never met before. @caps showed everyone her dance and the song, everybody laughed so hard i thought they were gonna pass out i had a lot of fun that night mostly because of @caps, she was very nice she was funny and she kept me thinking about other things then what was on my mind at the time @caps was a big ball of hyper that night, i thought that it was funny. we were just standing there in the shed and she goes  mouse  and i scream and jump up on to a chair and scream  @caps!  @caps reassures me that it was in the rafters and couldn't come down and get us so for the rest of the time we just acted like he wasn't even there i'm really lucky to have @caps and i'm really glad for the day i worked up enough courage to go over and say hi to her that day in art cause other wise id be lost @person is the best friend a girl could ever ask for and i was fortunate enough to get her for my best friend. she is smart funny and talented and i would miss her if she were gone @caps really glad she moved down here from port orford.
41  it all started with a book @date @date ago. my mom had noticed i was struggling to find friends, so she took it upon herself to help me make some. she had a few friends from school who had kids of their own, some my age. i had been around these girls a few times as a child, but not recently. i'm not sure today what my mom saw in @location that made her think we would click, but she was right. what seemed like such a small action would change my life drastically. in @date, in my new house i first met @person. that evening before she arrived i couldn't help but be very upset at my mom for doing this. i felt i was fine and fully capable of making friends myself. she acted like she knew me, but the few acquaintances i had she didn't believe would be good for me. i didn't think she could be right this time and i didn't want to waste my time. an abrupt knock on the door interrupted my train of thought, i could her muffled voices and footsteps downstairs. quickly i retreated to my room and onto my bed. the bulky front door opened and closed again followed by footsteps coming up to my room. when @person first walked into my room my first thought there was no way we would get along. she was a gorgeous blond girl, obviously popular and very confident. i couldn't stop thinking how she was going to call me freak and poke at my differences like the other girls at school did.  @caps, what are you reading?  @person asked as she sat on my bed. come look for yourself.  i replied offering her the book in my hands. i knew she would hate this book. it was about all the microorganisms that live and feed off your body. i was right and as she leaned over cautiously @person read the book with a disgusted look on her face. laughter was boiling up inside me, i couldn't hold it much longer. my small, dull room buzzed with my laughter. @person looked over at me with another strange look on her face and began to laugh along with me. once the laughter had stopped and the ice was broken we began to talk about other interests. @date short hours flew by and we were finding plenty of things we had in common. we shared funny stories, introduced new music to one another, and talked about hobbies. i couldn't remember the last time i felt so in-tune with someone, especially someone i had just met! suddenly our conversation was interrupted by a brisk knock on the door downstairs, we looked at each other and smiled. in that smile i saw a real person smiling at me with real pleasure showing through. very much unlike previous encounters with kids at school. downstairs we said our good-bye's to one another. as the new, cool @date air began to rush through the opened door i reached out to hug her. to my surprise she took my gesture and ran back to hug me. her hair smelled of hair products and powder, a smell very unfamiliar but surprisingly comforting. once she was gone for the night i began to think. i really liked @person and i wanted to see her again soon. i felt accomplished in some way and fulfilled to have this bright future opportunity brought to me so easily and perfectly. guilt also struck me as i realized how i had felt about @person at first. for someone who had been judged through most of school i had been very hypocritical. that night i stayed up later than usual thinking about the next time i could see her, how she had looked and tried to understand how we could get along so well. despite these questions haunting the edge of my every thought i slept happily, thinking of the next time i would get to see her. all of those @date questions and concerns have been answered in the @date, and we are the closest friends. not long after we started hanging out more often, we began to like one another a lot. one of my favorite parts about our relationship is how people get so confused to see us two different so close to one another. we can take the stares, comments and anything else we struggle with today and find a way to laugh together to reduce the importance of it. i have thanked my mom over these @date for many things, but mostly for what she has done for my relationship. if it hadn't of been for her my life would probably of been much darker. no one on that cold night expected this one meeting to evolve into our beautiful relationship. laughter is an extremely vital part of a relationship whether it is being built or being kept up. thanks to laughter excelling conversation @date @date ago, i have had the best experience i could of ever asked for.
35  side by side with my best friend @person we begin to walk to the park. the rained on @date @time wasn't very pretty or warm but the pleasures of watching lost and the hopeless at this particular park in @location was enough for us. approaching the grass to the benches, mud was dominating my shoes when i was starting to think other wise of such fun. sitting on the damp leaf filled benches we notice a man and his child walking toward us. although this man was quite odd looking we quickly grew excited for what he had to say to us was more than likely going to match his appearance.  the fellow looked to be in his late thirty's with tight pants covered in what appeared as sharpie written all over him. a knitted scarf and with a small hat to match he had this flaming homely look about him. beside him, a stroller with two small children, one at hand while the other lounging in a storage pocket below. the father we later find out, pretends his @num year old daughter is whispering in his ear, shouting things like  @caps was that ?! suggesting he hadn't heard her although we knew she hadn't said anything at all.  @caps want me to ask the girls if they want any raisins, is that what @caps want ? odd enough we look the raisins bushing them between the cracks of the benches on the few times he looked away. @person an i then look at each other when he starts ranting how beautiful and striking her eyes were. the laughter was watering out of our eyes and being under such pressure to redeem, it was wanting to burst out of us both. the man then take out his phone with a video of a country singer compare their faces toward one another.  minutes into the video i look away since the phone was now in @location's hands. i feel her nudging me from leaving her even just with my eyes and hadn't continued suffering with the ridiculous video. looking up i see the father staring at her as if waiting for some kind of reaction. back to @person i notice how uncomfortable we all were including his kids and he hadn't even a clue. throughout this whole interaction i hadn't said more than @num words in between the silent laughter and looking always that i couldn't control. my persistent friend who also hates being impolite then hands over the phone with a smile on her face and cheeks of red.  @caps really look just like her @caps know ? all these questions he had for us and no answers but laughter prancing inside us. the boiling silence was rising between us and very little we could handle next. pulling out a script the man then asks to see our acting skills and would like to direct us sometime. once he spilled those beans on us we jolted directly toward her house while pouring out our enormous amount of laughs being held in and effecting our ability to talk. breathe by breath running i could finally speak causing me to blurt how i could hardly fathom the reality of his request. just another day in @location we thought, but for us everyday was just something to laugh about.
40  have you ever got a detention from laughing an inordinate amount in class? if you haven't, you're very lucky. i know that teachers absolutely hate students that don't pay attention in class, or students that will randomly start laughing when they're giving a lecture. i'm that student that will randomly bust up laughing (preferably at my own jokes) in class. in other words, i'm a teachers worst nightmare.  ring....ring....ring, time for @caps. it was a beautiful afternoon and i was feeling great! when i walked into the class, i automatically noticed that our teacher wasn't his blessedly self. but i ignored it and went on with what i normally do, which is get out my @caps and crank up the tunes. i like to listen to music because it relaxes me and helps me focus more. the downside to listening to music is that you can't exactly hear everything that great. when i listen to music i have those moments when i feel like i'm in a movie that everything seems like it's in slow motion but you can't hear anything. it's almost like i'm secluded in my own little world and no one can see me or hear me, until i start laughing that is. finally class started and everyone was being abnormally loud, at this point i was starting to see the steam come out of our teachers ears. he looked like a cartoon character off of bugs bunny. the teacher was getting very indignant and impatient with the class. i didn't exactly pay much attention to him so i went back to listening to my music. after a while, our teacher was now starting to get frenzied with the class even more so he told everyone whoever talks again will get their name written up on the board and you will receive detention.  about five minutes later my friend @person comes and walks by me and starts talking to me. when i listen to music, i have a tendency to talk loud because i feel like they can't even hear me. so i start yelling, and she starts to giggle because when i wasn't looking my teacher was just staring at me wondering why i was talking so loud. he turns around and writes my name on the board (that meant i was given a warning). i turn to look at the teacher, oh no here it comes, @num my laughter is out, i couldn't control myself. when i laugh uncontrollably, i laugh like there's no tomorrow.  @caps! you owe me thirty minutes of detention!  said my teacher. one of the biggest problems that i have is i'm very easily amused, i laugh at mainly everything and anything. when my teacher yelled at me, his facial expression was just way too funny, so i began to laugh even harder.  when i start laughing, my friend @person usually can't help herself but start laughing with me. she tells the teacher that she was the one that made me laugh so she thought she deserved detention too. so she got what she wanted, detention! one week later, @person and i arrived in good old detention with all the other  rebels  (that's what i call myself now) it makes me feel tough. the thing that we have learned is that we should never be sitting next to each other. when we sit by each other, we can't stop laughing, but we decided to sit by each other anyways. what do you know, we almost got more detention while in detention, imagine that.   @caps's to short to live with tension and regrets, so just laugh it off!  that motto is what i try to live by everyday. i feel like laughing is a very important part in my @caps, it really helps me forget what is bothering me. even though i @month get in trouble from laughing, i don't regret it one bit. some people are very serious and they don't know how to let things go so they're always tense. laughing releases tension and for me i feel like it brings me closer to my friends. i love laughing with my friends and the feeling of your abs hurting from laughing is awesome!live your live, laugh as much as you can, and love those that mean the most to you.
35  we all understand the benefits of laughter. laughter can show emotions, but can also go to the distance of strengthening a friendship, or relationship. to many people laughter is a very important part of any relationship.  first, laughter is very important in a friendship. if you cant have a fun happy friendship then you wont have a good friendship. building up to a friendship is always sometimes difficult. it can take up to a good laugh, to not laughing at all to determine your friendship. having a friendship with someone is one of the best feelings. knowing that you have someone you can trust, talk to, be there for you, and the most important laugh with is a great feeling.  also, laughter is important in every childhood memories. thinking back to when i was little i was always laughing. even though my mom and dad left me and my brothers i always had my grandparents, brothers, cousins, even aunt and uncles to keep my busy and always have a good time. i think laughter is an important thing being a child because its healthy, you can learn to keep others spirits high and keep others laughing and happy, . and its always good to have a strong, fun, happy relationship with your family.  last, laughter is very important in a relationship. i think it will build character to your relationship and shows everyone that your happy with the person that your with. laughter will also build a good and strong healthy relationship and will lead to good things. if you think about it laughter is probably the most important in a relationship because when you decide to marry the person your with it will lead to not getting a divorce and fighting and you will have a strong relationship.  so, therefore after pointing out that laughter is important no matter what age, what gender, friendship, childhood, or relationship you should see that my point is that laughter is important no matter the situation. it helps build a strong person and also builds character to yourself.
40 water @caps of @caps @caps we think that laughter is just an emotion, but in all actuality it's practically a way of life. we use laughter to cheer people up, or get out of trouble. people do stupid things just to make others laugh. i personally think laughter is a reason to live, and that every one needs more of it in their daily lives. i have always been the type to make every one laugh and feel better, and i would always put myself in pain just to cheer someone else up. when i was a child my friend would always be picked on at school, for no reason really. and i wasn't the type to take action, or try and get back at someone. but that all changed when my friend came home covered with food crying before school was even let out. she told me that these girls threw their lunches at her and were calling her names. so the next day i went to school with her in the morning and i took @caps filled with chocolate milk, smoothie, egg yolks and soured milk. when she pointed the girls out to me i grabbed the balloon with chocolate milk and threw it right at one of them and it hit her in the chest. she started screaming that her clothes were designer, like someone would actually care. i looked at my friends face, she was awe shock, but i could tell she was trying to hold back her joy because she knew i was not yet finished. i then threw one with egg yolks in it and got in a girls hair, her scream was earsplitting. the smoothie filled one got two of the girls who were hugging to try and keep each other safe (or trying to use each other as a shield) but it wouldn't work with my throws. they started to freak out and run to the others, which was a bad idea because they were all hudled together trying to figure out who it was. by the time they figured it out it was too late, i was already throwing the biggest balloon filled with soured milk at them and they couldn't get out of there fast enough. it landed in between all of them and exploded when they had turned to see what it was that was thrown. it covered all of them and they started screaming so loud that the school officials started coming out of the building to see what all the screaming was about.  i could see everyone of the kids who saw the whole show coming over to me, they started to tell me how amazing it was and how funny the girl's reactions were. some kids were still on the ground laughing so hard they couldn't breathe. some thanked me and told me that these girls had been picking on them for a while. i looked at my friend who was on the verge of tears. she ran over and hugged me so tightly i thought the air was going to be squeezed out of me. it's been ten years since then and i still talk to my friend, she even occasionally calls me if she's having trouble with someone at school. as for the girls? i haven't heard anything about them since they all got transferred to different schools. i guess laughter is the source of all joy in our lives, and helps people become closer then ever before. my friend still says that it was the best day of her life. some of the other kids who witnessed the event go to high school with her now, and all ask how i am and want to see me do something like it again. unfortunately i had to turn them down and tell them they have to learn how to deal with their own bullies themselves. i imagine that some of them have come up with very creative ways to get back at people by going off of what i did.
45  laughter is a part of life that doesn't need to be taught. we're all born with the ability to laugh. laughter and being able to laugh has been with us since the beginning so we don't really think about how important laughing can be. it gives us a sense of relief, a feeling of joy, and it also brings people together despite barriers like background or language. i think one of the most important things laughter does for people is bring them together. when you meet with someone you haven't seen in a long time or you have to be in a group of people you don't know, a little laughter can break the ice and bring you closer. i want to tell of a time when i visited my family in @location who i hadn't seen since i was two years old.   my brother and i were the only ones visiting from our family. so we didn't get to have our mom there to make us feel comfortable, or introduce people. i was quite worried about being able to communicate with my family in @location because although i can understand and speak in @caps, i'm not fluent. being able to bond with the part of my family i never knew was very important to me and i was afraid that language would prevent that. i was also concerned for my brother because he can't speak @caps very well at all. while on the plane i contemplated how i should introduce myself, topics to talk about, and prepare answers for certain questions. i didn't want the language barrier to cause an awkward atmosphere.   finally it was time to arrive in @location. we landed in @organization, @location where a lot of my relatives live. my brother and i collected our baggage and went to go look for our uncles and aunts. we saw them waiting for us and @caps waved enthusiastically. then naturally we responded with the same enthusiastic feeling. as we met them for the first time we exchanged hugs and phrases like  i'm happy to meet you.  @caps were very kind to us and welcoming, but it still didn't feel like i was meeting my family. things were very different and new for us. it was a lot to take in for two people experiencing jet lag.   the first night, we stayed at our oldest uncle and aunt's house. we had dinner together and talked about how our family is doing back in @location. it was pretty awkward. communicating with elder relatives who can't speak @caps was a lot harder then i had thought. the first night passed as i slept in the uncomfortable humidity. the next morning our uncle and aunt had planned for us to have dinner with our cousins and other uncle and aunt. i was excited to meet more of my family so soon, but until then we had to pass the time exploring our new surroundings. my brother and i checked out the house and walked up and down the streets. immediately we could see the differences from what we were used to. we had a lot of fun embracing the fact that we were in a different country we have been familiar with, but never really known.   at last it was time to meet up for dinner with our other relatives. we drove into the downtown area of @organization and met up in a restaurant that overlooked the ocean, as @organization is right on the coast. i related to my cousins more because @caps were younger, in @caps're mid twenty, and generally i can get along easier with young people. we gathered in the noisy restaurant and were seated in an area sectioned off for more privacy. as we were ordering our food and admiring the scenery from the window, i felt more at ease. our food came and we started to eat. while we were eating, my cousin started cracking jokes which made everyone laugh. my brother and i were laughing so hard we teared up. during the whole dinner there was laughter and smiles. at that time i really began to feel like @caps were my family. i was really thankful for my cousin who started the laughter, because with out all the laughing i don't think we would have bonded so quickly.that was the time i felt that laughter is very important and brought me closer with the people i love.
48  from birth to young adulthood, kids are raised by their guardians or parents. it is the parent's responsibility to convey to their children good morals, life skills, and to teach them how to cope and thrive in society. @caps parenting children requires being firm and strictly reinforcing rules. the result of this however, is the child leaves their parents prepared to live their adult lives outside the home.it is safe to say that although i am a still a teenager, i have learned quite a lot about raising kids. my knowledge mostly being based off of stories passed down to me by my parents and grandparents about their life lessons. being  in on  these small, yet significant bits of history is quite enjoyable for me. i'd have to say that although many of the facts about the  good old days  are great, it is the almost tangible memories which my family connects with laughter that are the most significant to me. my @caps grew up in the @date's living in a small yet average sized house with her @caps, @caps, and four brothers and sisters. the main subject which is the focus of the stories my @caps retells about her childhood come from memories made at the dinner table. it was her @caps's (my @caps's) goal, for his children to learn proper manners and standard etiquette. it was expected of the @person children to practice this by being calm, courteous, and mindful of their physical actions when gathered around the table for dinner. for an average, fun, causal, and not so dignified @caps family, that was a lot to ask. throughout their childhood my @caps and her siblings tried their very best to behave and do as they were told at the dinner table. the only common occurrence that was particularly displeasing to my @caps was when someone spilled their milk. this fateful event happened almost every night. when milk was spilled it was either the cause of a child engaging in funny business, or it was a result of reaching to far to retrieve the butter dish. whatever the reason, it was somehow hysterically funny when this occurred. the only catch was, that laughing at the table was frowned upon for it seemed to break the formal mood the family strove for during the evening meal. laughing and spilling milk were two actions not encouraged at the dinner table. spilling milk did not continue to happen as often as the children grew up, but that is not to say that is discontinued it's presence at the dinner table completely. one night it was not my @caps nor any of her siblings that spilled their milk. instead, it was my @caps. when the initial incident occurred, the whole family was in a state of shock. in effort to clean up the mess everyone donated their napkin, while their @caps maintained a controlled but disgruntled demeanor. when all was cleaned up, the family went on with their meal and on my @caps's face was a subtle yet unmistakable grin. years later my @caps (@person), @person, @caps @caps, @person, and @person @caps grew up, got married, and some even began families of their own. most of my @caps's family lives in @location so they enjoyed coming up to visit their @caps and @caps (my @caps and @caps) at the holidays or whenever they were able. during these times when the entire family is able to gather here in @location, there is hardly ever a somber or serious moment at the dinner table. as my @caps would say,  @caps we laugh so hard that tears run down our legs.   i attribute to the fun we have together to this bond of love that connects us all, and i feel it would not be as prominent without the element of laughter. i feel that my @caps (who is now in heaven with @caps), accomplished the goal of preparing his children for life. now that they are all grown up, they can let loose, enjoy each others company, and feel free to bust out in laughter even if there is a risk of someone spilling their milk.
40  laughter is what connects me @person my friends. it's a very important aspect in any kind of relatioship. i know that almost all the memories i have are of my friends making me laugh, @person we have been friends for a very long time. one of my favorite funny memories is the time me @person two of my friends went to @location @person stopped at @organization @organization... we sort of had a hard time getting out. me @person my friends, @person, went to @location to do a cultural performance at @organization. when we were done we started heading back home. @person kept complaining about needing to use a restroom. her dad told her to wait until we got to @location so we could stop somewhere. @person @person i suggested @organization. by the time we got to @organization was doint the potty dance. @person @person i got in line to order ice cream cones dipped in chocolate. while we were waiting @person was searching for the restroom. after approximately four minutes of searching, @person finally asked the lady working behind the counter where the bathroom was. she handed @person a key with a large bulky wreath attached to it @person told her it was outside behind the building. @person took the key @person sprinted to what appeared to be double dorrs. little did @person know that only the left door opens. she ran straight into the right door @person fell over. we all started cracking up laughing... especially @person. she laughed so hard that she didn't quite make it to the restroom. instead she had an  accident  on the floor in @organization @organization. when you can laugh with your friends about things that might not seem funny to other people, such as, wetting yourself in public, it only makes your friendship stronger. laughing is a huge important benefit in any kind of relationship. it strengthens the relationships you already have @person it helps build new ones also.
35                                   how @caps @caps @caps only took one @date to change the whole purose of my @caps. two things that made my @caps more than i ever thought @caps could be; @caps and one girl. i realized over just one @date that there is more to @caps than what we see or hear. emotions that you can't describe. something that you have to live out for yourself. looking back on three months of @caps changing events, i laugh at how fast my @caps turned and started heading the right way. also how one girl can bring me to church and how @caps can keep a relationship moving strongly. we're part of a movement that will last forever. her and i moving on the perfect path to eternity with eachother. have you ever had a person in your @caps that made you so overwelmingly happy that @caps caused you to change your @caps plan forever? i have found some things on this earth that explain my whole purpose on earth. the first time i ever saw this girl. @caps was like a instant shock through my body. @caps felt like i needed her, like something was whispering in my ear, go get her.  one day talking to my friend about this girl i couldn't get out of my head. i told him how i was going to talk to her @date and there was nothing that was going to stop me.  @caps said, i have a class with her.   @caps thought about her and i together; like in a relationship. in a intense thought @caps looked up at me and said, actually i think you guys would be perfect together.  @caps that @caps said that i said,  sweet.  i talked to her that day. she was better than i expected. i needed back up though. i had a different friend come with me to talk to her and her friends. i saw her in the hall. so we started to walk over. we got to them and my friend just kept walking. thinking in my head,  what a great friend.  @caps was me alone with seven other girls. trying to look the best i could look. what @caps me is i actually pulled @caps off. she actually thought i was attractive. was @caps love at first sight? i don't know you tell me. getting close to @date. i got my license. looking forward to what my @date was going to look like. all was looking really good. until i found a job at a ice cream factory. waking up at four in the @time wasn't the best way to start out my @date. i still wanted to impress her and be with her all @date. i met a guy named @person. @caps asked if i wanted to study the bible with him. i knew that @person went to the same church. so i wanted to do @caps.  about two months @date they went to a church thing over in @location. @person was baptized there. then @date; after they got back. i was baptized. we both had @caps with us. love was building up between us. what better to do than date? we started dating on @date. wonderful moments that i will never forget. that look she gave me like fire burning in her eye's with love. going to the beach, driving around, fair rides, picking her up and never letting go.  still with love burning inside of us. i went to her house. lost track of time and noticed i was going to be late getting home. @caps was a rainy night. saying good bye to her parents and giving her a big hug. i ran out the door, got in my truck, and took off. couldn't see well. a corner popped out of no where. started slidding across the road. a tree was moving toward me. i hit the tree. in mid flight. time slowed way down. i thought is this @caps. one picture popped into my head. @caps was her face. i landed with a big screaming sound. i got out as fast as possible. i came out with cuts and bruises but that was @caps.  i thank @caps that i survied my crash. i am so lucky i didn't die. main oint is. i think i was put on this earth to be with her and thats what i'm sticking to. @caps's times like these that make you realize how amazing @caps is. laughing at @caps now. how laughter can change your @caps around. i finally said i love you girl. we are together to this day.
34 it was another warm muggy @date @time, when @location my best friend and i decided to go to our friend @person's house. as soon as we we walked the three mile walk to get to @person's house @location realizes that he forgot his phone charger at my house. we didn't want to walk all the way back to my house and we had no ride either because none of us have our license yet and and @person's parents aren't home. so @person and i start brainstorm on how to get back to my house to retrieve @location's cell phone charger, when suddenly...we heard a loud bang come from the backyard from the old rugged y shed in the back dark corner of the yard; @location and i go to check it out to see what the noise was. we open the shed and one of @person's dirt bikes had fallen over. @person and i pull the dirt bike out of the old spider-web infested shed. @person and i both got a light-bulb above our heads and suddenly looked up at each other with the same idea. not being so smart we figure @location can just ride the dirt bike the three mils back to my house on main roads and he will be fine. @person tells @person about are idea and @person says its a bad idea because he mom is not home and he doesn't want us getting in trouble for a phone charger. @person repeatedly tells us to put the dirt bikes back, but next thing you know @location has the bike out front testing it out around the neighbor hood. i tell @location  since there is only one dirt bike you take it and ill follow on the @caps bike!  next thing you know me and @person are side by side riding a dirt bike and a @caps bike down the busiest road in town and its pitch black outside.  @person you go and ill meet you there!  i yell. @person takes off down the road at about @num mph and im about @num yards behind him. suddenly i see a white figure start to creep out from a driveway, i cant quite make out what it is... when suddenly i see flashing red and blue lights! i try to warn @location and shout  @person @num!!!  yet he is to far away to hear me but since its pitch black outside the lights light up the whole street, @location tries to loose him by going down a side road but its no match for a charger cop car. it's out of my hands now so i bike back to jeremys house and get him and we run the the scene of the crime to see whats happening. we keep are distance and act like we don't know him. the cop has @person in cuffs standing behind the cop car and the cop goes back to his car to write @person a ticket and i see @location shadows under the street light throw something into the bush's.. since it wasn't his dirt bike and he couldn't ride it him the cop calls a tow truck and has him take the bike and the cop gives @location a ride home with @money in tickets.. as soon as they leave the scene i go check to see what @location threw in the bush's and it was a can of chew because he is a minor.. so i grab it. the next day @location is home and his parents are at work so i bring him his chew, and he starts to tel us what his mom punished him with when suddenly we heard the garage door start to open; his mom was home from work so i hand him his chew and i run out the backyard and over the fence. he tells me to not tell to many people because he doesn't want everyone knowing but its already the talk of the town...
40  my high school @caps basketball team isn't the best team, but the one thing that we do have, is the ability to make each other laugh. at the start of @date the school held try outs and the teams were decided. after graduating seniors and some players not coming out, or team was brand new. full with all different ages of players. we all were civil with each other at practices but we weren't all best friends that wanted to hang out outside of practice. the @caps team decided to take a retreat to the beach and stay @caps for a weekend.  when we went to leave to the beach our phones were taken and we had assigned seats in the cars. this trip seemed like it was going to be a long one with out my phone. we arrived at the house @time. as we all found somewhere to relax, shower or sleep myself and most of the team ended up in the living room conversing with the coaches. we all sat on the floor recalling stories about the game from that @time or funny stories from our past. by the time we finished telling stories it had reached @time and everyone in the house was either tired or hungry.  as we sat on the floor complaining about tiredness or hunger we all started to turn our attention to @location. @person was starting to go on a tirade about how hungry she was. in her opinion she thought the house we were staying in should of already been stoked with food for us for when we got @caps, but @caps was no food. as she continued on her rant she became more and more mad which made us laugh harder and harder. finally she reached her point.  @caps's no steak or chicken up in these mother freak-in cabinets.  @person proclaimed. at that point the coaches and players started laughing uncontrollable. @person didn't understand why it was so funny, but we kept laughing and laughing at the fact that she just said that @caps should be steak and chicken in the cabinets. the outburst of laughter continued on for the next five to ten minutes.  when we finally started to calm down @person came down stairs. she had missed everything that had happened and as we went to fill her in @location stopped us.  @person @caps up on the counter and look in the cabinet,  @person said. @person hesitantly got up on the counter and slowly started to open the cabinet. when she opened the cabinet she looked inside and all she could see was chips. she turned around and looked at @location.  @caps?  asked @person. as she turned to @location, @person just sat @caps smiling. then she finally answered the question.  @caps me some of those chips right @caps!  @person said.  everyone in the room started laughing as @person was so confused to why she was asked to @caps on a counter just so she could @caps @person chips, who had been sitting next to the counter the whole @time. the whole basketball team started laughing again. @person got down from the counter but with no chips in hand. we all continued laughing and kept talking about @caps had just happened for the next @num minutes.  as everyone finally started to settle into their beds for the @time @caps were still those moments of  @caps when this was said , and  @caps when she did this . that first @time that we spent at the beach did more for us then we realized. by going to the beach and making memories together we were brought together by two common things. the love for basketball, and most of all the ability to be able to come together as a team all because of the memories we shared that @time in the kitchen. today we still @caps on each others nerves and sometimes we lose our tempers with another but, we will always laugh about the crazy things that happened on the trip but the thing we laugh about the most is @caps happened that @time in the kitchen.   
40  for a year and two months i'd devoted my life to horses, school, and @caps. we started off as friends in @caps grade, and it escalated to a relationship in @location grade. we ended up breaking up later on that year, but we continued to remain 'friends'. obviously i still cared for @caps, but i didn't believe he'd felt the same. but apparently i was wrong, we began a new relationship on @date at @num pm.    it was the perfect start to our 'perfect relationship'. he and i were inseperable from the get go, we literally did everything together. i was @percent irrevocably in love with @caps. between the two of us, we shared some crazy memories and inside jokes. i could probably write a best selling novel of all the memories we had, and i honestly believed that @caps and i were going to be together forever. i thought everythign was going fine, till he had to lay it out, he liked someone else.   at that point, i had no idea where our relationship (or i) stood. i didn't want to know. i couldnt keep putting my heart in the open if it was going to get stomped on, but i loved @caps and was willing to do anything to make it work. i stayed the night with @caps, and we talked till @num. he and i decided to attempt to make it work, but there was no guarantee it was going to.     the next day, everything seemed fine. i was still extremely irritated that he liked another girl, but i was using all my power to make the best of what we had. we decidded to take his dog, @caps, on a walk. we held hands as we walked, but it was too quiet. why? he was texting @caps. by that time, i decided that was the final straw. it felt like i was getting in the way, so i felt that the only choice i had left was to leave @caps.  i walked in the door an hour later absolutely devistated. i cried till i felt i couldn't cry anymore, and then i would cry more. at the time, i truly felt that the world was ending right before me. my life was over. my days became long and depressing, and i felt that all i could do was give up. my heart shattered everytime i saw @caps, and it made it even worse when people constantly asked about what had happened. i couldn't tell them, it wasn't a moment i would want to relive. i couldn't stop thinking about @caps, and about all the memories we'd shared. that year and two months has been the greatest period of my life.   almost everytime i thought about @caps i would cry. i couldn't stand the thought of not having @caps, and thinking about @caps all the time made me into a walking zombie. i couldn't eat, i couldn't drink, and i would vomit because of the stress. but as i sat there in alone thinking of the memories, a miracle happened: i laughed. i was shocked, but it made me realize that i needed to keep living. i don't regret any of the time i spent with @caps, he changed my life. he taught me so much about loving someone. i knew from that small laugh, that things were going to get better. a spark of hope, i would be happy again. 
40  for me there are so many parts in my life that involve laughter. having fun and laughing are the main things that i do in my life. when i laugh i feel happy, so whenever i'm sad or mad people can always tell a joke or something to make me giggle and then i'm happy again. i love making people laugh. sometimes when i try and make people laugh i tell a joke but i'm not that funny. when i just be myself, people laugh. i guess i can be funny without even trying.  i have amazing friends, i mean absolutely amazing, although we have our rough days i still love them and thank @caps for them everyday. my friends and i are always cooking up some way to have fun, and every time we find something to do @caps always turns out to be funny. even the little things, such as facial expressions, the way we pronounce a word, or even the way we eat our food makes us laugh. @caps's actually pretty ridiculous. when my friends and i try to tell other people about our extremely hilarious adventures, they all just stare at us as we burst into laughter. @caps's possible that people don't think @caps's funny because they weren't there.   this year my family has an exchange student named, @person. she is from @location. she is very shy and quiet. @person never seemed like the type to make me laugh, @caps boy was i wrong. she is possibly the funniest thing to walk the @location. i sure think she's funny, anyway. sometimes she is so oblivious that @caps is just hard not to laugh at her. i have a best friend named @person. we have so many fun memories together. she is amazing and funny. she is so short, people call her a midget, she is quick to reply,  i am not a midget! i am @num' @num'', you have to be @num' @num'' to be a midget!  @caps is so cute when she does this.  i recently moved back from living with my grandparents in @location. while i was living there i had been informed (over the phone i might add) that there was a girl living in my old bedroom.  @caps's a foreign exchange student from @location,  my family told me. i flew back up to @location for @caps with my family. when i got here i met @person. she seemed so quiet and sweet. @caps was late when we got home so i immediately went to sleep. the next day i woke up, called my grandma, then called @person and asked her to come over and hang out with me. she came and met @person. @person told us she wanted to get my mom a birthday gift and i replied,  @caps, that's tomorrow, lets go into town.  all three of us went to town and went to @organization for @caps. when we got there we all looked around for something we thought she might like. somehow, we ended up in the underwear aisle. @person picked out a tiny sized pair of underwear and shouted,  @caps @person, what about these?  @person looked at her with the funniest facial expression and shouted back, @caps, i don't think my thighs would fit through that!  @person and i literally fell onto the floor and laughed so hard that our faces were bright red. based on our first impression, we thought she was a quiet,  keep to herself  kind of girl so we just thought @caps was hilarious. we tease @person about this quite often and she teases back about other funny things we've encountered. i've grown to love @person and i love being with her and making fun out of all situations.   
37  it seems like everyday of everyone's life they are being tested in every way shape and form and it seems like it will never end. it gets to be stressful and complicated but this is what makes us human. something else that makes us human is laughter but no matter how bad things get to be it can always be changed by a knock knock joke, comic ad, or just one word from a best friend. iv been with my dad and a couple of his high school buddies as they are telling stories about some of the crazy stuff they did when they were in high school. my dad and his friend @caps went off into a story about when they bought a @num @location tempest for @money. it turned out to be the greatest life lesson and some of the funniest stories in my life.  this was my dad's second car he ever had with a @num and a @num speed anything was possible. it started out when my dad first drove it to school which didn't last long, because an hour later. @caps and my dad left doing a burn out on speed bumps in the school parking lot. this car was a burn out animal backing up then side stepping the clutch to second and it would all be up in smoke. one day my dad was sliding around gravel corners and one of the rear bias ply tires blown out it thrown that car into the ditch and messed up the side pretty bad. joe enders pulled him out and half a gallon of dera glass a hammer and a can of paint later it was ready to go again.  the next story i heard was when my dad's friend borrowed the car he needed something to get him back and forth to work. so my dad hands him the keys and says  keep it on @num wheels . two weeks later on a weekend he was out messing around and the car slid off the road and rolled a few times and buckled the roof. i never heard how he got out but somehow he did and returned the car to my dad. after that it had an organ transplant of a roof from a @caps that hit a tree, @num weeks later and it's ready to go again. now it's just something about a rear wheel drive car and snow that makes us kids again. sliding around in snow was the last thing this car ever did. my dad and @caps were driving in the snow having fun when the back end decided to trade places with the front. they lost control as they slid across the winter wonderland to a lonely telephone pole. the car slid into the pole and it was the end of fun. finally the car had died and my dad had brought the car back home. he decided not to fix it and parted it out he sold the @num speed for @num @money the engine for @num and the rear end for @num the trunk and hood weren't far behind for another @num the seat, steering column and radio my dad kept, the rest was scrap. so all in all my dad had some of the greatest moments of his life for no more than gas money and a few spare parts. god bless @location and i hope someday soon i can have memories like that. 
30 so one time my friends chad, justin and i ding dong ditched this old man. the reason we did this is because we would walk by his house everyday and he would turn on his sprinkler and this annoying alarm thing. so at like nine or ten at night we walked over to his house, banged on his door and ran. it was so funny cuz when we got back from running we went to our friend taylors house and we where sittting in the garage just basking in the glory of what we had just accomplished. about ten seconds later we heard banging on the garage door. at first we where kinda startled so we ran into taylors room, and thats when it happend... the funniest shit ever, the old mad just started scearming and banging on the door then he yelled  come out boys what are you afraind of?!  and we just crack up in laughter. well he totally knew we where in there so he went to the front door and started banging on that, waking up taylors mom. wel we ended up going out and talking to the guy and he said he called the cops cause he said it happened all the time. and we denied it was us, but it totally was so we couldnt help but laugh in his ugly face. he seriously looked like a turtle crossed with an eighty year old rapest. he had liver spots on his face and a terrible grey combover that wasnt fooling anyone. by the time the cops showed up the guy was long gone and we told the cop he was senile and didnt know what the hell he was talking about. so we got off scotfree. it was funny and awesome.
37  laughing at @caps bell. @caps best friend and i have a lot of funny, hilarious memories together. we are always laughing about something even if @caps's something completely stupid or actually really funny. we laugh at things like people that look funny, or people that say stupid things. also we laugh at funny things we do. @caps one thing that has always stuck to @caps head, the time at @caps bell. one day after school, me and @caps best friend @person decided to go across the street from our school and eat lunch at @caps bell. we ordered our food and went to sit down and wait for @caps. a few minuets later our food was ready and we sat down to eat @caps.  @caps  i said to @location as i took a bite of @caps @caps five layer burrito.  @caps @caps was really hot and burned @caps mouth. i had to wait for a few minuets to eat @caps burrito. so we both just sat, waiting for our burritos to cool off, an talked about school and other things that was going on with our lives. a couple minuets later a man walked in, he was about @num or @num years old, and he had his back against us so we couldn't see his face. the man ordered his food and turned around to take a seat. meanwhile i thought @caps burrito was cooled down enough and i went to take a bite, at the same time the man looked at us and he was wearing a clown mask and he had a little dog with a tiara on his head. next thing i knew @caps burrito was coming out of @caps mouth and i was dieing of laughter.  @caps burrito was spit completely out of @caps mouth, and all over me an @location. all over @caps hair, mouth, clothes, and all over the table. i was so embarrassed that i couldn't help @caps to laugh. i think the main reason i was laughing so hard was because the man was just so scary looking, @caps wow we were laughing for what seemed like an hour straight. you might think this was the end of @caps bad day, @caps @caps only gets worse. eating @caps burrito seemed forever, because we were laughing forever. @caps probable took me a good ten minutes to eat a single burrito. meanwhile i got thirsty and needed something to drink. so i went to order a small drink and get some @caps@number as i was returning to @caps table i wasn't looking and ran into a man that was in line. i almost spilled @caps @caps@number @caps luckily i didn't. returning to @caps seat i was talking to @person about how bad @caps day was, and how @caps couldn't get any worse. then i took a drink an i started to choke on @caps @caps@number @caps was so bad that i spit everything out onto @location, @caps@number went flying everywhere, @caps even came out of @caps noes. so i went into the bathroom, and cleaned @caps self up, caught @caps breath, and told @person i was ready to go home. when i look back and think about the day at @caps bell with @caps best friend, i not only think about how embarrassing @caps was for me and her, @caps also that @caps was a really great, hilarious memory that i will probably remember for the rest of @caps life. as i said before @caps best friend and i have a lot of funny memories together, and still we are making more everyday.
40  i have heard people say that a smile makes a big difference in a first meeting, a relationship, or just walking past people on the street. if someone has had a bad @caps, not only should a smile make it better, but also some laughter along to accompany that sincere smile. i enjoy walking down the street on a nice, beautiful @caps and walking by locals i know that smile, laugh, and give a little wave to show that they are enjoying the @caps as much as i am. walking past someone i @month not know also has its positives. one look to see their face can tell me if they are having a good @caps or a bad @caps. either way, i give a smile. a smile to show that it is a good @caps or a smile of encouragement to let them know it will get better. i enjoy the feeling i get @caps i meet someone and i know that we connected great. a good first impression is very important for me because it can determine how the friendship will go and how long it can last. i now know that i enjoy being around someone like me who enjoys to smile and laugh. i can't really seem to see myself around a serious person and i know if i was, we would clash and have problems because i am loud and if they are serious, there would be problems and not be able to collaborate on decisions.  @caps i first met my friend @caps, i was nervous and scared because we were set up as a blind date by a mutual friend. it was a @organization's @caps double date with our friend and my cousin. @caps the guys first picked us, i got into the car and the first thing that i remember was seeing a big smile on this guy's face. i ended up getting more nervous and began to stutter as we started to talk. as the date went on, he seemed like a down to earth guy and always seemed to have a smile on his face and laughter seemed to flow right out of him. as time went on, we became closer than what i would have ever thought of. i was not sure where our friendship would lead us, but soon after, it became noticeable that he liked me and i liked him. we took it slow, not rushing into things. we had long conversations that would last us hours at a time and we always seemed to laugh about everything. he made everything seem better and better each and every time we talked. pretty much having the same personality and both always smiling and laughing helped us connect right away.  just the other night , @caps and @caps, our mutual friend, came over to visit my cousin @person and me at her house. we were all laughing and enjoying each others company @caps @caps and @person decided to go to the store and buy some things using @caps's car. since they weren't going to be gone for long, @caps and i decided to wait inside. minutes after that, as we sat, talking to each other, @caps and @person run into the house looking flushed, out of breath, scared and nervous about something. @caps wouldn't look at us, so @person told us to go outside, something had happened to the car. as we stood there, i realized that the car was no where in sight in the driveway, so i became suspicious. we asked them where the car was and they pointed to the road and in the dark all we could see was the faint outline of a car in the ditch. i was expecting @caps to get mad and say something to @caps, who seemed to not know what to say, but instead he smiled, walked towards the car and said,  @caps't worry, the car is fine.  @caps he said that, he started laughing, his amazing laugh. i was still in the state of shock and so @caps i heard that laugh of his, i turned and looked at him, and realizing that he was happy and didn't seem to mind the accident, i began laughing as well and in less than @num seconds of him beginning to laugh, not only was it us four laughing, but also two of my other cousins that had joined us outside. laughter made the situation better and i enjoyed the fact that we could all laugh about the smallest, the unexpected and the worst as well as the best. what also made me happy, was the fact that that very same night after the incident, @caps asked me the question i was hoping to hear and the way he said it made me laugh which then caused him to laugh. i answered his question with a hug and a yes and he brought out a banquet of roses. as we walked inside, my cousins and my aunt started to applaud and we all started to laugh with smiles on our faces.
40                                     laughter @caps @caps for the @organization is a very important thing in life , i personally could not live without laughter in my life i honestly could not do it. i would not be me if i didn't have laughter in my life . all relationships should have laughter involved in some way ,what would a relationship be without laughter! laughter is a beautiful thing , when i am laughing i am enjoying life in in my own way and my worries instantly go away and some how i feel like i am  carefree   . laughter makes us healthy both physically and mentally . through out my life there have been many times where laughter has been involved in many relationships . but let me tell you about a time where laughter really stood out and was and still is a big part of my relationship with my dad.   i have always been very close to my dad , you might even say i am a daddy's little girl .laughter has played a very important role in my relationship with my dad. it somehow always found its way into our relationship. the @caps times of laughter are what i valued and treasured so much that whenever i think about it i cant help but smile . i remember when i was little if i ever needed a @caps laugh my dad was the person to call . the laughter grew stronger through out the years , i cannot recall a time where my dad and i had a moment where laughter was not involved . we always used to watch these @caps shows together that we would almost always laugh so hard it was impossible to get through the show without making noise or miss something because we were both laughing so hard .we would laugh so hard we would wake up the whole family ,sometimes we didn't even know why we were laughing it would just happen . i can just hear those sweet sounds of laughter between my dad and i oh how i miss those @caps @num nights were what i looked forward to, i knew that i would soon be laughing along with my dad and tears of joy would be running down our faces . i looked forward to that sweet sound of laughter it was almost impossible to go through the entire show without laughing ,oh what @caps times those were . since my dad moved to @location ,we haven't had those beautiful times of laughter that i miss so much, but i can always treasure them in my heart. those moments of laughter were the best moments i have ever had with my dad,since i was little girl till now almost an adult . i don't know if my dad and i would be as close today if we hadn't had all that laughter throughout our lives. whenever i am sad or miss my dad , i go back to those times we had filled with laughter, and listen to his laugh playing in my head. i never knew how important laughter would be to me. i am glad laughter played such an important part in my life. laughter is such an important part of life/relationships because it brings joy and happiness. laughter is the type of thing that no matter what , should always be a part of any relationship. i think laughter is healthy for our bodies, for example if you're sad ,depressed ,or just not having a @caps day a @caps laugh will change that and make you feel a lot better ,like it did for my dad and i. laughter also makes relationships last longer , the reason why i am so close to my dad , best friend, mom, boy friend , sisters etc is because of laughter itself . if laughter was not involved in my relationships , i could not handle being sad all the time everyone needs a little laughter sometime in their life. my dad is the reason why i laugh so much , he showed me how laughter is such a powerful thing but yet so simple. i never thought laughter would be such an important part of my life until my dad showed me just how valuable it really is.  where i would be today without laughter i truly have no idea. my dad taught me how laughter can change your attitude on things and how important it is to have laughter in your relationship. if laughter was not involved in any relationship , the world would be very boring no laughter or smiles,can you imagine having no laughter at all! i certainly cant imagine life without laughter. if my relationship with my dad had no laughter we would not be the same people we are today in fact , we would be completely different people and we would not be as close as we are today. what do you think about laughter? has laughter ever played an important part in any of your relationships?  
46 sometimes, @caps @caps @caps to @caps i glanced around nervously as much mother drove up to the strange and unfamiliar building that was to be @caps new @organization.  @caps around! we can come back another time...or @caps not come back at all.  @caps mother laughed and continued to search for a parking spot. i slumped down in @caps seat, discouraged and lonely. @date was the first day of @caps sophomore year in @organization @organization, and i had to spend it at a new @organization @organization; @organization. transferring to a new @organization would not @caps been so bad if i hadn't been forced to leave the @organization i loved, the @organization i had friends in, the @organization which met @caps selective needs and wants. i was dreading this day and only wished i could go home and sleep this vivid nightmare away.  @caps mom had to practically drag me from our minivan to the @organization doors, for both @caps body and mind were aching to run in the opposite direction. there was a massive crowd of students swarming around the room, which would later be known to me as  the commons.  @caps mom introduced me to the woman in charge, @person, then waved goodbye and headed back to the car. i felt nauseous, and @caps heart was pounding as i glanced around at @caps new peers. i did not see even one familiar or friendly face. not being an outgoing person was a struggle for me, especially when i was faced with new surroundings, such as this @organization. the truth was, i didn't even want to make any friends. i @caps wanted to go back to @organization;@caps @organization.  as the day progressed, @caps mood only got worse. no one had even tried to be nice to me, and i wasn't really trying either. as the students were taking a field trip down to the @caps campus down the street, i ran into a girl who looked @caps as uncomfortable as i did. @caps had long, blond, straight hair, brown eyes, and a pierced nose. we started walking together, our steps in sync with each other, although no words were exchanged. we both @caps felt more comfortable standing next to each other, rather than standing alone. at the @caps campus, i decided to abandon @caps timid, protective shell, and i asked her where @caps was from.  @location,  @caps replied.  @caps family moved here last @date, so i was home schooled until the end of the year,  @caps informed me, her voice laced with nervousness. we continued to make small talk as our group took a tour through the building. i still had not learned her name though because i couldn't read the handwriting on her name tag, and i was too embarrassed to ask what it was. fortunately @caps started talking about her name.  @caps parents named me @person because @caps mom is @caps, and i guess @caps really liked that name.  @caps shrugged and rolled her eyes. @caps told me i could call her by her nickname, @person, because @caps didn't like people talking to her using her full name.  after our tour, all the groups of students headed back to the @organization, for we were going to @caps a pizza party for lunch. as @person and i sat in the corner munching on our food, we studied the kids around us.  @caps...this is going to be the worst year ever,  i said gloomily. we stared pitifully at each other for a moment, sizing up the difficult times ahead of us. then, simultaneously, we both cracked a smile. next thing i knew, we were laughing hysterically, our bodies rocking back and forth with every breathe that managed to escape our lips.  sometimes, when life throws me lemons, instead of making lemonade, i pucker up @caps lips at the thought of how sour they are, and i @caps @caps to @caps. although laughing did not automatically make @caps new @organization a fun and welcoming place, it made it @caps a little more bearable. laughter truly is the best medicine, no matter what the illness or problem is, and it can make two strangers into friends almost immediately.
47   dog @caps of @date  @caps made me laugh every time i saw her droopy ears and pointy little nose. @caps was my best friend, my dog. @caps brought me happiness every moment i was with her. barking at the squirrels in the backyard to keeping me warm at night. all the crazy stuff that amazing dog did, brought a smile to my face. the laughter and joy to my heart.  every @date when we went camping with the @person family, we had to bring her with us. we had to bring her her own sleeping bag and camping chair to sit in. after a long day of swimming and walking around the lake,@caps would hop up in her chair and go to sleep by the warm fire. when we walked with the other families dog @person, @caps would carry her own leash like in her mouth like i would've been holding it. every little thing @caps did differently than the average dog made us laugh. @caps was  @caps,  as we called her. @caps also loved to  log.  @caps pulled around giant logs or sticks in the water and chewed on them until there was nothing left but back. all of the grandparents loved her too. grandpa had special cookies just for her because @caps didn't like just any cookie. the time @caps went over to his house on his birthday wearing her own party hat, jumping on his lap to give him a birthday kiss. he laughed so hard his eyes started to water. every time we went somewhere the other grandma would beg to  @caps-sit,  @caps. che loved her so much. when @caps was there @caps didn't get a kennel or a dog bed, @caps got the couch. @caps would take @caps into town to buy her a cheeseburger and go to the park.  i taught her to do tricks like the @location where @caps bounced on her hind legs in circles, and i also taught her @caps to speak. i would say  @caps's on top a house?   @caps@number (@caps),   who was the greatest @caps player ever?   @caps@number (@caps @caps),  and  @caps does sandpaper feel?   @caps@number that made everyone laugh. we would spend hours doing nothing but tricks and playing in the back yard.  our family took her on @caps we called  @caps @caps,  to the river to go swim and fish with us. @caps had fun running and splashing with us in the water. we also took her to the coast to play on the beach.we took her everywhere with us, and @caps loved it. @caps was also the only dog at the park that knew @caps to slide. everyone was so amazed at @caps @caps could do. they had never seen anything like her before.  @caps made many people laugh and smile when they saw her. @caps was my best friend and the smartest dog i knew. from going to the park to slide, camping and swimming to just being a lazy dog, @caps made me laugh. @caps's gone now, but her memory still remains. @caps will never be forgotten. 
40  when i was in third grade my parents decided that we should move to where my @caps was born and raised and where my @caps lived. i, being a determined third grader, was angry and told them that i would not move and even sat on the floor and told them that i was not going. needless to say i did not get very far, but i was still not happy about being moved from my friends and my @caps's side of the family that i had been around since i was little. my friends were all i had known through my years in elementary school and i was no where near ready to say goodbye to them. it was very hard saying goodbye to them even though we came back and visited later on. we moved three hours away from my hometown. it was a pretty big move, especially for a ten year old who had never really been anywhere else.  being a new student is never easy. especially with a shy, quiet personality like mine is and the first day was a scary one. i remember it very vividly. i walked in with my @caps and my new teacher happened to be in the office at the time, so she took me down to the class and showed me around the school. i was still frightened and was upset that my parents were making me go through this huge change. when class started the teacher made me stand up in front of the class and tell them about myself. i have never been much of a public speaker and it is hard for me to believe that i actually did stand there and talk about myself. i can not even do that very well today, and i am way less shy then i was back then. it was very terrifying to say the least even more so when i was done speaking and the class sat in dead silence. then i slowly walked to my seat and being the shy person i am, did not talk for the rest of the time until lunch.  at lunch a little girl with freckles and glasses, like myself, came and sat with me. once she broke down my shy exterior we were laughing, playing and having a real good time. and for the first time that day i thought to myself that moving might turn out to be okay. me and her became really good friends along with the other girls she hung out with. we sat next to each other in class, talked on the phone, had sleepovers and spent recess together everyday. she was the first best friend i had made when i moved and i was glad it was her and not someone else. today i am very thankful to her for taking the time to get to know me when i at first was shy and not saying much, because i know how it feels to approach someone you do not know.  the laughter that we shared that first day at lunch and her willingness to break down my walls of shyness really brought us close together. without her that first day i am unsure how the rest of that day or week would have gone. without people like her who are willing to make a new friend it would have been a lonely first couple of days for me. laughter is an important part of a relationship because it brings people closer together and shows that even if you do not know someone very well you still can have a good time. the rest of that day is a better memory because we shared laughter and became friends. it made moving to a new school less scary and helped me to find a place to fit in.
41  can you imagine life without laughter? life would be so serious, and relationships would be so boring. that favorite comedy? not funny. america's @caps @caps @caps's, how can you not laugh! laughter is a way to express emotions in a positive manor. what is it that relationships are built off of? honesty, trust, understanding, and humor. do you really want to be around someone @caps is boring? because i don't. i believe strong friendships and relationships need laughter in them to keep them interesting. many of my relationships have begun from a joke, laughter, or me being clumsy. i remember being in a class where i knew no one, and this is a very awkward situation to be in. i sat in the back of the class, with one other person, her name was @person. it started off quite and no on saying anything, so i decided to tell an extremely cheesy joke. as soon as i told it, there was a silence afterward, where we just stared at each other. seconds later we busted out in laughter, you know the kind of uncontrollable laugh, where you cannot breath, and your tear ducts are overwhelmed to the point where tears slide down your cheeks? when this happened there is a sudden bond, a spark of friendship between the two of us. from that point we were inseparable. for the rest of the school year, we were partners on every project, multitasking our way through them. half the time we would be making up funny scenarios, and laughing until we cried. the other half we would have make a fantastic project using the inspiration of each other to get the work done. i am an all around  laughter enthusiast!  i can make the smallest things funny, its a quality i enjoy very much @caps knew a silly joke could go so far? laughter cannot be the only element to a developed relationship, you need trust, honesty and various qualities to keep a healthy relationship. my point is, how can you maintain a friendship with someone @caps you can laugh with, or be yourself with? it is human nature to laugh, you can't always be serious. i don't think that i could go a day without laughing. laughing can be the antidote for a frown. moral of the story, laugh!
43 the @caps of laughter   the @caps of a single laugh is quite an astonishing thing. laughter has a strange way to either bring two people together or when used wrongly tear those people apart. in all of my relationships i have realized that being able to joke around and laugh with one another is a big deal. i have come to notice lately that i have an amazing best friend. @person is always here for me even after the mistake i made that ended tearing us apart. now that we have gotten over the @caps and can laugh about it, i've realized it makes being embarrassed a lot easier and brings me and my friends together. even when a best friend does something that wasn't right and neither one wants to fix it.   the @caps began last @date during my @caps soccer season, and should have never gone as far as it did or involved one of my friends. it was the hardest thing to admit that i had done wrong; both to her and him. the day we had gotten caught is now what i consider the scariest and worst day of my life. the @caps has also become a big learning point in my life, i've learned that all my actions do have consequences and how to balance what i want with what i should actually do.   when i first started soccer for @caps, i had never played with any of the people and i realized that by being the youngest on a @num team i would have to stand out and prove myself. which is exactly what i did; just not to the whole team. after playing for about two weeks i had started to notice one of the boys who was on my team. i hadn't really thought much about it but when both me and him started to pursue our relationship it became a whole other thing. the boy and i had been dating for about a month and a half when this began to involve @person. see we weren't exactly allowed to hang out or even date for that matter, but we knew that we would take the chance of getting into trouble for each other. and as time went on and we had began to get closer to each other, we also had began falling in love. that @month have been the reason i had chosen what i had but at the time it all seemed to make perfect sense.    then the @organization came around and we thought it would be the perfect time to see each other, little did we know this choice would result in us losing each other, me losing my freedom, both of us ruining my parent's trust and the worst of all me throwing away a great friend. we didn't think of these consequences so we went through with it. he would meet me at the @organization and i would tell my parents that i was just going to be with @person. at the beginning and throughout most of the time everything was going well me and him were having an amazing time because we could finally hang out with one another and nobody knew what was really going on. little did i know that my mother had called @person's mom to make sure that i was going to be were i said and with who i said, and as soon as she found out i wasn't everything went down hill from there.    it had already been a couple hours and we were starting to get hungry but neither of us wanted to eat the greasy food at the @organization so we decided to take yet another chance and leave, with me leaving @person at the @organization and her not knowing were i went. as my mom became more and more worried she starting calling @person to see were i was and of course @person had no idea. on her list to call next was me. when my mom first tried calling me i decided not to answer and have her think i was just on a ride or something, but when she kept calling i knew that something was wrong. as i answered the phone i knew that she knew what i had been doing, but i still didn't want to believe what was happening. i thought that the only way my mom could have found out was because @person called and told her that she couldn't find me and who i was with.    so that is what i ended up accusing @person of for at least a month after it happened. i couldn't look at her or even talk to her with out feeling resentment and embarrassment. when everything finally settled down, from being caught to being grounded the whole @date, i knew that i needed to apologize for the position i put @person in. it was the hardest thing i have ever done. but now knowing that @person and i can laugh about it makes remembering that time so much easier and better.
36  laughter is the expression of being happy, being able to be yourself around the people you care about, and expressing your feelings. anyone can share laughter with anyone, even if someone you dont know very well or someone you have known for a long time and dont talk anymore, make someone else feel good by sharing a laugh with them. last year my close friend, @location and i were together all the time almost everyday. we always make other laugh at the silliest little things, even if no one else understands what we are talking about. we can make laughter out of any small thing. we hang out a lot so that makes it easier to share our laughter with each other. one day in class we were just sitting in class reading a book and i turn around, there she is sleeping, with drool coming out of her mouth. the room was quiet, i was trying not to laugh really hard i started giggling. i poked her and she woke up and had her hair stuck to the side of her face. it was so funny, i couldnt hold it in anymore. she had a confused look on her face then i pulled out my mirror and showed her what i was laughing at, then she started laughing too. she fixed her hair and wiped the drool away. then the teacher walked over to us and asked us if we had a problem. we looked at each other and giggled then replied with no we do not have a problem here.  the next day we were walking to the commons after we had come back from @organization and we heard one girl say to another girl,  is that all you do is talk crap about your sister?  @caps girl was not a regular girl, she had purple faded dyed hair and teeth that stuck out over her bottom lip, which made the whole thing even more hilarious. @location and i looked at each other and were like holy crap did that really just happen right there? we started laughing after we were out of ear shot so she could not hear us laughing at her. we laughed about that for the rest of the year. everytime we saw her after that we called her  girl with purple hair , because no other girl at our school at the time had purple hair so it was really easy to spot her out of a crowd. still to @caps day laugh every once in a while about that situation.   a few weeks later after @caps had happened we had seen her former boyfriend hanging out with a group of girls so we went closer to see who they were, i did not know any of them, but i saw a couple of them and knew that they were freshman. @location gives them a dirty look and says he definately down graded since i dated him. there was one certain girl that was literally hanging all over him. she was not even pretty at all. she had a short hair cut, but her hair was all greasy, it was like she had put lots of gel or had not taken a shower in two days. the girl was wearing clothes that were obviously way too small for her, you could see half of her upper body just exposed there. it was really trashy. we started laughing really hard because it was so obvious she was trying to get his attention and he was totally ignoring her. @location looked at me and we both starting laughing. i am not really sure what she was laughing at, because i was laughing at the girl hanging all over @location's former boyfriend.   the next day we were in @caps @caps class and i made a comment about someone was being stupid and a student in the classroom tried to get me in trouble fo rit, but luckily my teacher liked me a lot better than the other student, because that person got in trouble way more frequently than i have. later on in the day i got called down to the office because the vice principal needed to speak to me. he said @caps student has a problem with me calling him stupid. i have had lots of issues with @caps person and i told the vice principal that he is very obnxious, and i also explained everything else that happened earlier. the vice principal told me that i am not in trouble because he was trying to start an issue. we laughed because he tried to get me in trouble and it did not work, then we both laughed because that student is a trouble maker.  i have learned that throughout life you need to have a good laugh every now and then because laughter expresses your feelings and sometimes it just makes you feel really good. i know that with my experience i need to have those close people to make me laugh, also to get me through anything that i am going through.
32 one day my friend and i were waking up late in the day and his brother came in screaming and yelling at the top of his lungs  bro bro ! this was the nickname he called him because he was only two years old, so my friend spencer calmed him down and we started watching t.v. we were talking about what we were going to do for the day so, we started throwing out ideas till we made one where we were going to swim later and play some games now. spencers mom asked us when we were going to swim and that we had to take his little borther. so we went early so his little bro could swim and we could sit around and listen to music. unlike everyone who uses an ipod i use my phone because then i can text and listen to music plus when someone calls it shuts off music so i'll know. it was a brand new phone too and i was loving every moment of having it. so when we dropped his little brother off we went back too the pool and sat in the hot tub for a while. i put my phone on my shirt and my towl over both so when spencer got out too use the towl he jerked the towl out and my phone flew up hit the ground slid on the floor all the way too the hot tub. that moment i look down and see it and freak i took it out ripped the back off and dried the battery with the towl hoping it would still work and it wouldn't stop dialing zero and nine so i took the battery out again. when we got back to his moms i plugged in the charger with no battery and spencer kept saying sorry and i kept answering  its ok . the next morning his mom asked why we didn't use a pot of rice and we started laughing because we freaked out so bad over a phone. i forgot all about the phone after that just kept laughing and the phone worked it is one of the funniest stories. 
40 like all great things in life, laughter is the thing that keeps me going. without laughter i'm depleted. i'll tell you about the three things that make me laugh the most in life. first is @caps mom. (@location) @caps mom is the one that showed me, laughing is the key to almost everything. she showed me it's okay to fall down. laugh at the fact you're silly, you messed up but make sure to get back up. @caps mom can make me laugh no matter what is going on in @caps teenage  drama  life. the biggest thing i've learned is when i'm emotionally broken, when i feel the whole world is against me and i just don't want to be me anymore to laugh through it. when me and @caps best friend got into a fight @time @date i didn't come out of @caps house for about a week and a half, i didn't want to talk to any of @caps friends. @caps mom tried to get me to call her but i never did, till one day @caps mom sat down on @caps bed and said  @caps it's not want happens to you it's what you do with it, do you hear me laughing all the time, when i'm upset, sad and happy...that's what i want you to do no matter what is going on in your  drama  teenage life don't shrug it off @caps laugh it off, call her. @caps @caps friends definitely take second place. like @caps friends, i also have @caps. when i'm with them nothing else phases me, the whole world could be ending and i wouldn't notice a thing. i feel since i have @caps i speak a different language that most people can't understand besides @caps friends with @caps. @caps friends are very random and have a lot of energy. one thing that they taught me is having @caps is a gift and a curse. when @person and i are hanging out it doesn't matter who we're around we make there day, we can't help feeling goofy plus the non-stop laughing. sometimes it gets us into things like people our age think we're laughing at them when we're really not.third place is me. i make myself laugh more than anyone or anything. i'm a total comedian. when i try to be funny i'm not that funny but when i don't try i make people laugh so hard they cry. @caps whole life i've been told  @caps, wow you really are something no matter what mood someone's in you just make life seem so amazing.  @caps people laugh is one thing but @caps myself laugh is very different. when i was sitting on the floor in @caps room @time i was thinking about @caps past life and became pretty upset but to pull myself out of the negative thinking i started thinking about the good times i've and within five minutes i was laughing so hard @caps stomach hurt.     like i said  like all great things  laughter is @caps greatest. laughing really can open someones eyes. i will continue to live laughing and eventually pass it down when the time comes.  
31  laughter can be helpful in many ways and with many things. like, if your having a bad day, a friend can try and make you laugh to help you feel better. or maybe something like you lost a loved one. yes it's a very tragic thing, especially if you really close to that family member. people will still try and make you laugh and tell you that there in a better place and won't be in pain anymore. i have had some moments like this and i sometimes felt better after the person or persons have made me laugh. i also know that i have people that care for me and want me to be happy and full of laughter. the most recent time i have needed someone to help me laugh was yesterday. it was yesterday night, i had math homework that i needed too do. it frustrated me so much, i started too cry. i told my boyfriend this and he just started telling all of these silly jokes. they kind of helped. what helped the most though was when he had said he could come over this @date. i started smiling and laughing because i was so happy that he could. another time that i have had laughter help me was when i was at @caps with my mom, dad, brother, and little sister about @num years ago. my brother decided that he want too take me on @caps @caps. i can't remember if that was the ride though. anyway, he took me in it about @num or @num time. i was so scared, and wet that i didn't talk too him for the rest of the day. he finally apologized and took me too a face painter lady in one of the stores. i chose what i wanted on my face, i can't quite remember what it was though, i think it was some kind of fish. but, after she had finished, i looked in the mirror she had and i burst out laughing. i laughed for about ten minutes and said that i accepted his apology. when we arrived home a few days later, i took the hose and sprayed him with it just too get him back. and too be a little stinker of a sister, like all little sisters should be every once and a while in my opinion. thank gosh it was during the @date because me and him did it a few more times just too be brats too mom and dad. lastly, i remember this one time in @num grade when my best friend @caps was moving. i cried for days and days. then finally he calls me and we talked for about @num hours, and talking too him just made me laugh, and wish that he hadn't of moved. at least i still got too talk too him. only about once or twice though. anyway, those times talking too him made me so happy. we talked about his dogs. one of his dogs names is @caps, she was about @num months at the time. she started chasing her tail and when she went around about @num times, she tripped over her feet and fell on her rump. so, to end this trip down memory lane. those three blasts from the pasts were the ones that made me laugh too help me feel better when i was feeling upset, or down.
32  on a hot @date day during the middle of @date and i were having a blast camping in @location. @person and her family took me along on their camping trip we stayed in their @caps, our campsite was right by the ocean so we would go on daily walks there. we stayed in @location for a week. during that week, i believe on @date her older sister went into labor she lives in @location which is a pretty long drive from @location. that morning @person's mom and dad woke us up very early in the morning around six thirty a.m, @person and i had stayed up @time before until about three thirty in the morning so we were pretty tired at that point. we found out that we were going to take a little plane from @location to @location airport and we got it fairly cheap because @person's brother works there. sense we knew we had a long day ahead of us on only about three hours of sleep we both drank very strong coffee to keep us going. then we were off to the airport the whole way there we were laughing about everything street signs, names of buildings, funny looking birds, songs, also we have @caps accents that we say every word with so it was that much funnier. my stomach muscles hurt so bad i don't know if we were laughing because things were actually funny or if we were delirious from not having much sleep and on top of that on a caffeine high and sugar rush. once we got to the actual airport we still could not stop laughing @person's parents were getting frustrated with us even though we were making them crack up also. we all boarded the plane and we sat next to each other of course. we swear still to this day that we had a secret agent sitting behind us he had on spy glasses, a suit and an ear piece @caps the secret agents wear that protect the president we kept making up stories about what he does we couldn't stop laughing. finally he started to talk to us. we were very enthused he was telling us all the places he was going the place i remember the most is @location a secret agent! we knew it at this point. we thought how awesome of a job! of course @person's parents interrupted  i'm sorry sir, are they bothering you?  @caps we were some kind of pest, he replied  of course not, i have nothing better to do.  we even had him laughing so hard that he was crying i guess you could say we are pretty funny when we are together. the best part was when her mom was having anxiety about flying i mean its not funny but she mad it funny because she was saying things such as  oh my goodness were gonna crash, girls be quiet your freaking me out  etc. @person and i took advantage of the situation and made her even more scared. finally we landed. at the airport we went to the restroom and there was free toothbrushes so we took some @person took a green one and i took a pink one. we used them all day in pictures and everything. then we got a rental car and went to the hospital still laughing about everything we got into the hospital and finally seen the baby she was so cute. we started to settle down once we were in the room. after about an hour we went out to eat we were all so hungry. we ate then had to sit around and waste three hours we went to the mall then to @person's family's house we crashed! @person and i were dead! but we still had the flight home, dreading every step we didn't know how we were going to make it. finally we got on the plane went back to camp and went to sleep. it was one of those  had to be there  days i cant put the emotion and laughter into words it was that funny. we are best friends for a reason were definitely not boring which i think keeps us so close.
36       well since you guys want to hear a funny story, i got a couple but i'm only going to tell you about one of them. this one starts in my @date. i was living out in @location and it gets pretty hot in the @date. i lived there a couple summers @caps i know how hot it gets. this @date i wanted to get a pool for the fun and to stay cool. but i didn't want a pool that just i could hangout in. i wanted to get a really nice pool for everyone. i already knew that those kind costed a bunch of money but, i wanted to get a big pool @caps i could have all my friends come over , hangout , swim and play my favorite game mar-co polo.i went to go talk to my dad about my pool idea. he said  that he would love to get a pool for the @date  cause he would come in and swim with me and hangout but, like i was saying @caps are expensive and @num exactly what my dad said. i told him that i would pay for half of what ever it costed. my dad finally agreed with me @caps we go down to walmart and look at there pools. there was some cheap small ones and there was a lot of huge expensive ones but, i was looking for one right in the middle, not to small , and not to much money. i found one for eight hundred that was perfect for what i wanted. i went to go asked my dad if i could get this one. he said  that if i pay for four hundred of it like the original deal that i could get it . like i told him @num what i said i was going to do and @num what i needed to do . we finally came to an agreement that we had to get the money first , @caps i went back to my house in @location to make a plan to get four hundred dollars, my dad was doing the same, but he has a job @caps its not that hard for him cause he gets paid. @num a lot harder on me cause i have no job. @caps i decided to fix my bike and go looking around for any jobs available. i went door to door to find people that needed any help around there house. i found a couple of people who needed some stuff done and @caps both agreed to pay me fifty bucks, @caps out of each i could get a hundred right off the bat.i had to haul a bunch of old tree branches and garbage away. when i was done i put that money in my pool savings for later. i also went to this place called @organization and i was good friends with one of the kids that was related to them. i talked to him about him asking them if i could do any work for a little cash. @caps said that  i could go to every tree and put a pink tag on him and @caps agreed to give me eighty five bucks. i took there deal but, my bike can't go threw the mud where the trees were planted. my friend said that  i could barrow his little fifty dirt bike and take it to put those tags on the trees . @caps i borrowed it and got that eighty five bucks. i gave my friend ten cause he let me borrow his dirt bike.i'm almost half way to my four hundred. when i was thinking, i got @caps caught up in buying this pool that i forgot my birthday was coming up tomorrow. i told my dad that i wanted that pool for my birthday and @num like  yeah i already knew that @caps i already bought it . i was @caps happy that i got my pool. now i have like two hundred bucks to spend and i didn't know what to buy. @caps i bought a bunch of food and stuff for the pool party. on my birthday i invited a bunch of friends over to my house. we all got in the pool even the parents.we decided to play mar-co polo. cause i wanted to play. my friend @person@num dad who is a huge dude was playing. i said mar-co and he lunged at me. i moved but he kept going, he went straight threw my pools wall and everyone fell out of the pool. i was laughing @caps hard but i was also upset cause my pool is already broken. luckily @person@num dad is rich, @caps he bought me another pool. he seen how crushed i was on my birthday and because he knew i wanted that pool. he also bought me a new bike and it was sick. during the @date i had a blast in my pool and if i wasn't in my pool, i was on my new bike.
31  i choose to have a positive out look on life and i'm generally a happy person. who wants to go through life mad all the time? even at my lowest i know that i have a lot to be thankful for. because of this, laughter is an every day factor of my life. when i'm with friends and family i am always laughing. laughter is my medicine and i wouldn't be the same girl with out it. when i was in the fourth grade my family and i began going to a new @caps i didn't know any one there and i was really nervous about going to @date @time. mom walked me down the stairs to the classroom and the teacher introduced herself to me. her name was @person. she was pretty and very tall with a funny australian accent. she was wearing alligator skin boots with black jeans and a pink top. ms. @person introduced me to the class stating my name and grade. after taking my seat we recited @caps versus and read short clips of @caps stories. when @caps had ended mom came downstairs to gt me. reculctant as i was to see her i took hold of her hand, said bye to @person,and went back upstairs without one word from any of the other kids, but on our way upstairs a girl about my age, from which i recognized from the class said goodbye to me. i returned her nice gesture with a smile and a wave. one week later mom took me downstairs to @organization. this time i was relentless and determined to make a new friend. i went and sat down next to the girl who said goodbye to me last week. i introduced myself to her and she told me her name was @person. we soon became very close. every week i was so excited for @caps so i could spend time with @organization. we became best friends! we played on the same soccer team together and we pretty much live at one anothers houses. in fact @person has her own toothbrush at my house and i have one at her house as well. one time @person and i were in @caps, and now that we are older we go to the main service, we laughed so hard we almost peed our pants! @person and i have so many great memories together and though we are becoming older the memories will last forever.
40  laughter is important in any relationship because it brings two people closer, connecting them between something they have in common forming an unbreakable bond between the two of them laughter is the glue that holds together any relationship and keeps a person from breaking into tears when something wrong happens. in fact without laughter i probably would not even get through my day to day school life. without laughter one class in particular would be a nightmare.  in @organization we are dissecting cats and we are working with a partner, if i was not making jokes and laughing while i worked, my partner and i would have hated each other. we got to choose our partner and work at a lab station with another pair of students, fortunately for me i knew all of the people i was working near and with, and i was friends with all of them. we had to wear gloves and suits so we didn't get fluids or  cat juices  on us. first, we had to skin the cat, of course there is more than one way to do this, you can cut, slice, rip, and pull to remove the skin. then we had to view and identify the muscles this was especially hard because we could not tell where one muscle begins and another ends. next we had to remove the muscles and identify the bones and digestive organs. after we identified the bones and digestive organs, we had to remove them and view the stomach, liver, intestines, and kidneys. we had to cut open the stomach, intestines, and kidneys to look at the structure of them. lastly, we had to remove the heart and lungs. the class was told we are doing dissections for about a month and it has only been three weeks. you can only imagine how horrible and fascinating it is and how much i need laughter to keep myself together and from going insane. my friends keep me from breaking into tears and keep me laughing.  dissecting cats in @organization @organization @organization was challenging not only physically, but mentally challenging as well. it stressful, fascinating, and gross, and without the jokes and the laughter i do not think i would have never made it through it. my friends support there when i needed it guided me through the terrible assignment. so as you can clearly see, without laughter i would not be able to do some of the day to day things i do at school.
31  i woke up just like any other day happy yet lacking sleep. as i got out of bed i would have never known that to day would be the funniest day of my life. i got ready for school after getting out of bed. when i got to school every thing seemed like our normal homecoming tell there was a announcement on the intercoms that had told every body out of no where there was a dance tonight. so after school was done me and my friends were going to head over to our house's to get dressed for the dance. after we were all dressed @person picked us all up and we headed to the dance looking fly.  when we got there every body was looking dressed to dance except one guy, he was wearing corduroy pants with a red tucked in flannel and some brown worn out work boots. we look at him from head to toe and we thought to our self are we in a messed up hillbilly dream? that was just the beginning of what was yet to come. as every body started to get in grove of the beat we soon all started dancing to the music the music was good and every body was having a good time even the kid with the flannel. but just as every thing was going good a song came on that was called cotton eyed @caps when the flanneled kid heard this song he almost jumped out of his corduroy pants he soon stared kicking and swinging his feet and arms like if they had no bone or joints in them. every body started to form a circular around the kid and every body was laughing and copying the kids movement even us. he didn't rely care he just kept dancing and singing to the song. the funnest thing about this was that the dance was a formal one and yet this kid manged to pull off wearing a flannel, some boots, and a pair ofcorduroy pants this kid was out of his mind in fact we still laugh and talk about it tell this day.
