0.5 dear, @caps @caps @caps more and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. those who support advances in technology believe that computers have a positive effect on people. others have different ideas. a great amount in the world today are using computers, some for work and spme for the fun of it. computers is one of mans greatest accomplishments. computers are helpful in so many ways, @caps, news, and live streams. don't get me wrong way to much people spend time on the computer and they should be out interacting with others but who are we to tell them what to do. when i grow up i want to be a author or a journalist and i know for a fact that both of those jobs involve lots of time on time on the computer, one @month spend more time then the other but you know exactly what @caps getting at. so what if some expert think people are spending to much time on the computer and not exercising, enjoying natures and interacting with family and friends. for all the expert knows that its how must people make a living and we don't know why people choose to use the computer for a great amount of time and to be honest it's non of my concern and it shouldn't be the so called experts concern. people interact a thousand times a day on the computers. computers keep lots of kids of the streets instead of being out and causing trouble. computers helps the @organization locate most wanted criminals. as you can see computers are more useful to society then you think, computers benefit society.
0.4 dear, in this world today we should have everyone useing computers. computers have a positive effect on people. they teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and even allow people to talk online with other people. today computers are like the worlds biggest book of knowledge. everything you need to know is in a computer. you can look up faraway places, and zap theres everything you need to know write in front of you. computers are fast and easy, everyone can use them. today kids are so addicted to computers everyday they are on them. there are so many websites that kids and teens go on, like @caps, and facebook ect. on these websites kids as young as ten years old are chatting with friends and putting up pictures. thers is also webchat websites that allow you to use a webcame and talk to people anywhere in the world. computers are a great way to get in touch with people. everyone should have a computer in there home today.
0.8 dear local newspaper, @caps name is @person and i am a @organization citizen. i believe that computers do not benefit society of all! in @caps opinion, they make our town worse. people spend way too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. all of these things are @caps computers are doing to our society and it's time to make a stop to it! first of all, people are on the computer way too much. teens are on social networking sites, adults are on chatrooms, and kids are playing computer games. instead of that, people should be playing outside, or going for a walk in the park. did you know that @percent of adults are overweight? if people cut back the amount of time indoors, we could probably bring that number way down. also, who knows @caps teens are doing on the computer. computers have good things but they can also be bad. for example, chatrooms who knows @caps kind of people are in chatrooms. children need to be careful about @caps they say or show on the internet. instead of playing games or talking to their boyfriends and girlfriends, teens should go outside and exercise. second, more citizens need to enjoy nature and the beautiful senery around them. were all so busy running to check our e-mail, we don't notice @caps a beautiful day it is outside. on a nice @date or @date day, people should take this kids to a local park or pond. this reminds me of last @date when i went to @caps cousins house. @caps aunt only allowed us to watch one hour as a day, that included the computer. we were outside every single day, even if we were just staring into the clouds. this kept us active and enjoy the environment. @caps last reason why computers are badly affecting society is that computers take time away from interacting with family and friends. i know @caps your thinking, when your on the computer you are talking to family and friends, but it isn't the same. instead of instant messaging call them. maybe even invite them our to talk face to face. that reminds me of @caps sister. when i get home, she will normally be on @caps. now, instead of getting up and coming to talk to me she will text me  @caps's up?  or  @caps was your day?  computers help people communicate, but they also take communication away. as you can see, i have given you three reasons why i strongly believe computers are badly @organization. not only @organization but everywhere! you need to open your eyes and understand that people spend way too much time on computers, they allow people to not enjoy nature, or interact with their families. please i'm asking you to understand that our society will crash it we don't fix this issue. so @caps are you going to do about it?
0.8 dear local newspaper a lot more people uses computers daily but not everyone agrees that it benefits society. those people who supports advsnces in technology believe that computers have a positive effect on the people and i agree on some circumstances but looking at the situation cleary i dont agree due to the fact that its better not spending to much time on the computers. first because its way better excercising, @caps enjoying nature and lastly interacting with family. @caps why i dont agree that people should be in ther computer more their doing things better in life. first, becacuse it's useful to exercise. talking a walk around the nieghborhood of just going for a hike with people you know. even better going to the gym its such a better way to spend your evening instead sitting infront of a computer doing nothing but to look at a screen all day and plus exercising makes you stay in perfect fit, healthy and strong for as long as you live. a computer can just kill you not in reality but sitting all day only on the computer eating when you feel like it and no exercise that is whats going to kill you and make you become so lazy to do nothing. i know nobody would want that for sure. @caps, enjoy nature live life the way it needs to. gods creations of nature is the must beautiful thing in this world dont let it go all to waist. jump off a waterfall or go to the park let the wind hit your face. make imaginations become real and just enjoy what natures about. third and last, interact with your family and friends. spend time with them and watch movies or any sports channels. go with them for some ice cream. dont let them feel left out or unloved. the mall is a great way to spend time with your friends or family also going to water parks like six flag or lake compound of place like nomads or chuckie cheese its a great way places to spend and interact with your family and friends it also can bring closer as well. this is why i think sitting infront of a computer screen all day, first its a waist of time when you go do some exercise or @caps enjoy nature or lastly interact with your family and friends, @caps why sitting infront of a computer as a waist of time and negative why to spend your days of living life. technology holds you back from the real things in life. thank you for reading my letter and hope you take it in consideration. good day!
0.6 do you think computers effect people's society? computers help people of age first, computers let you chat with friends and family. also, computers let you learn a lot about history. finally, computer is a great way to keep busy. first computer is a great way to chat with friend that you havent spoke to in a long time. also, it helps you meet new friends and to keep in touch with them in the long run. finally the computer technologies is outstanding cause it allows you to chat with family memebers across state through video chat or even websites such as myspace, facebook and twitter. secondly, @organization is a great way to learn about history. you can find history on almost everything from the past to the present. you can learn history about famous people places and events. that why i think the computer technologie is so outstanding what you think will happen if we didnt have today? finally, computer is a great way to keep busy because you take the time looking up information for school projects. also, you can spent your spare time playing games that help you learn or even book flight ticket for vacation. finally, the technologie is here for a reason so we should use it for anything like getting up with friends or jus going on to look up information on anything you need to find out. in conclusion, i just told you why computer technologie is good to have. first, it lets you friends and family. also, computers let you learn a lot about history. finally, computer is a great way to keep busy. now i just told you why @organization technologie is a good thing to have. i hope agree with my point of view.
0.8 computers have helped people tramendisly over the past years. thanks to computers scientist have found cures for desesse, jobs have become easier . i believe that computers have a baseline effect on people. because they educate people with their jobs, and give people a chance to talk to people having to pay for anything. if someone to a country that they have they might go on the computer to learn more about that country and their culture. another thing they might do @caps go to a website that could help them find affordable . if a child @caps doing a report about a country in @location thay can go on the computer to find out facts on that country. computers educate people about about places all over the world, you can go on a website that has videos and written sheet clips about what has been goin on around the world and learn about current events. my grandmother would tell me stories about @caps @caps before they had computers, now my dad works on @caps @caps and he tells me stories about his day. when you compair the two different decades it saids like computers help out a lot within @caps @caps. before computers stores would have to do math in their pad when they were giving change back to people, now people save by punching in the numbers in the computer. i think the computers have helped people with their jobs. when you talk on the phone to someone it costs you money. when you just want to see someone i'l costs you money to get on a phone . with computers you can , or onstant message people with any costs. if you want to see a friend for her @caps but dont have the money to fly halfway around the world to see her you can vidieo chat with her. computers help people save money by talking on the computers with friends, family and even co-workers. computers have been very helpful ever since they were invented. they help people learn about places all over the world and about anything you want to learn about. they also make jobs and work easier and also help people save a lot of money by talking to people on the computers insted of on the phone. computers have improved demastrecly over the years, the screens use to be so small and you would have to press all these buttons just to open it up and now computers can be as big as a flat @caps@number and can turn them on with just a push on a button,, who knows what computers will be like @num years from now?
0.8 hello, i decided to write in to the paper on the topic of computers, and how they benefit society. comuters are powerful machines, and can be used completing otherwise menial and boring tasks. they benefit people in many ways, like they are very useful in buissness, helpful in education, and connect friends and family together. computers are uselful in buissness and are an extremely important tool in a common workplace today, and make work get done much more efficiently than if they didn't have computers. one reason computers are so useful in the workplace is because computers can storee far more data that can be put on paper. also, they can do jobs and processes very quickly, which is important in the workplace. they can also be used for sending important information quickly and without much trouble. these are all valid reasons comuters are beneficial in buissness, and help things get done. computers are important today's schools and educational programs becasue they can help students work in a more efficient fashion.  @percent of all surveyed students said they would rather type a paper for school than write on by hand, and shows that they value them in their education.  said @person, a professor at @organization. this shows that computers are important to students, and are used their benefit. in addition to students writing papers, computers are being used by teachers and school systems for grading, attendance records, and more. the teachers at my school are using @caps @caps, pieces of hardware that are directly connected to computers, and can be used instead of white @caps, and i see that students are getting more involved in class, and focused, because this computer technology is being used. all of these @caps are reasons computers are helpful in educational proceeses, and should continue to be used. many people want to be able talk to there friends and family when they are bored, and because of computers and social networking websites, and instant messaging programs, this is made much easier.  @percent of teens have at least one sacial networking site they visit on a regular basis.  said @person, a phycologist, who speciaizes in teens, this shows that people use these sites, and that they like them. families that are separated because one @month have moved out of the house recently might want to communicate with one another, and because of computers, they can. there are multiple ways that they could use their computers to keep in touch, like instant messaging systems mentioned before. being able to communicate with one another makes theses people happy, and benefits society. overall, being able to communicate through computers is an enjoyable thing for many people, and is important to society today. to conclude, computers contribute to society in ways that make it much better for everyone. whether it's through helping buissnesses being more efficient, giving students the ability to work faster, and in a way they prefer, or if it's helping people stay in touch, computers are always benefiting society. these machines hardly ever slow people more thant manually doing the work would, and the positive influence they have far outweighs the bad they do.
0.6 do you remember the last time you locked something up on the computer? many people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. those who support a trances in technology believe that computer have a positive effect on people. i support computers because they help with writing, locking up information and provide communication. one reason i support computers is because they help with writing. you can tell i do not have the greatest hand writing. to help this, i type almost all of my papers. computers can also help people with spelling and gramar. there are even systems now that let you say something and @caps will appear on the screen. this is just one reason i support computers. next, computers are benifical because of the information they can provide.  before computers you would need to go to the libary and find around ten books that might not even have what your looking for. now you can find hundreds of articals on any topic in minutes. the amount of information out there is un imageinable. i think computers are a great of technology because of the information they can provide. finally, i believe computer are a benifit to us because of comunication. one term of communication that came out recently is @caps. @caps is a website that let's you sent messages to a friend, share picture, videos and many more things. e-mail let's you send letters to people via internet instantly. i could go on forever about forms of comunication on the internet. this is the last reason i support computers. computers are a great benifit to society. they help with writing, communication, and everyone could benifit form computers.
0.5 dear @caps and @caps of the @location @caps i think that computers are a good thing to use. i know that some people do use the computer instead of enjoying a or exercising, but not everyone does that, the computer is a good resource to invest time in. the effects computers have on people is good (for the most part). the statement is true, people that use the computer can talk with people online and get information quickly than the library. i believe that the effects a computer has on a person, are good effects. when people use a computer they can get information which for research and work (word) that's because, when your on a computer you can simply relax but get available amount of work done. you can also do things while your on the computer, hold your dog, hold your cat, eat, drink, text, call. it's very multi propose (use). but some computers is a bad thing because not how the very expensive and same dont have the money to buy a computer but if you do have, you because they're of people or example @caps cheated and not a computer he could have good so rich and rumors because the computer is what he needs to be succesful with microsoft so computers are useful and the effect they have on people is a positive one.
0.7 dear @person, @caps these days are telling kids to go outside instead of vegging out in front of a computer. computers can but promote bad habits. i try not to use the computer unless i have too for school or to get homework. please consider the negative effects which are exercising in apropprate content and less interaction with friends/family. yes internets can be used to find diets and exercise plans but if you would just go to the gym to burn of those pounds everything would be just fine! internet and computers are designed to suck in your brain, and attack you to all the websites and neat little things. it is more effective just to go to a local @organization or @organization to work out. i swim on a swim team for a @organization. i love swimming better than going on the computer. it satisfies my personal needs of exercising. i lost @num pounds by just swimming for a month. i will run on the tred mill to help me burn of stress or anger. gyms are way better than computers. i know most of us have seen something inapropprate on the computer. yes computers give people jobs but there is no need to post pictures or messages that will hurt peoples feelings. i know the other day i saw a really mean comment that made me feel bad for the victim. i know youtube is trying to stop inappropriate content, so hurray for them. once you give something to the internet it is lost forever. yes computers have ways to keep in touch with friends but it is better to @caps or visit in person. like my @caps always said,  @caps more, it builds character!  @caps ever i get the chance i @caps my best buddies instead of using the computer. kids theses days can be mean with out try. you disconnect yourself from your family. because computers attrack users, there are times where you don't pay attention to others around you. @percent of kids donot do there home work because of computers. thank you for your time. i think computers are bad and everyone would be happy with out them. they help the obesity level in the nation, let cyber bullying and inappronrate content flow around the internet and lastly block you out from the world. ( @caps.s someday computers are going to take over the world and you will be sorry you didn't listen to me.)
0.8 every where you look people are using computers. just about everyone has one. some say that computers are bad for you but they can really benefit society. computers are used for research, socializing and almost all of our @caps work is done on computers. one of the main things that computers provide is research information. if you want to find out anything, you can find it on the internet. it is an efficient way to study or find information for school. before the internet and computers, it would take weeks to find enough information for a paper or business work. this was because all information was found in books. books did not always give you the information you needed whatever was written was all you got. because of saearch engines and websites, you can type in whatever you want to look up. it is much easier to log onto a computer and type in a question than search an entire book to find an answer. computers are the best way to research a topic. computers are also used to socialize. you can chat with almost anyone on the internet. being social is one of the most important parts of life. it has been proven by science that social people live longer than people who never talk to anyone. the person you're talking to phnes only give you audio and that doesn't give you the some thing. video chat can allow you to show someone a picture or an expression. computers allow you to see people that you can't see otherwise. for example, if you have a relative that lives far way and you cant him or her, you can see them through video that socializing through computers is pne of the best ways to talk to people. our @caps is mainly run on computers, without them, it would be very difficult to be aware of an on coming attack or threat. the @caps uses computers to store thir legal files of court cases laws, etc. it is much easier to transfer files digitally than actually sending a paper copy. the store market is also run on computers. you need them to see how you are doing financially computers are essential to our @caps and economy. although some experts say that computers do us no good, computers benefit our society very much. they help us research, socialize and they help our @caps and economy. computers are essential to our way of life.
0.5 i think that the computers are good to be used because anybody can use them at anytime or go on it whenever they want to. the reason why i think it is good is because you can contact someone that you know and talk to them whenever you want. another reason is because you can play games or look for something or even make a research on stuff that you want to know or about something that you were always curious about. a computer is also usefull for better things like using it for when going to work or when a kid in school needs to do a report of project and needs to do it in typing and also to save stuff that you don't want nobody to use. computers can sometimes be helpfull to people that really need it and that actually need to use it, but it can also be a fun activity to do if anybody doesnt have nothing to do. i think that the computer is awsome because anybody enough can open up their own website and create something what. a lot of people can go on the internet and open an account on a website; for example a @caps or a @caps or a @caps for that what to have an account. these are a lot of people that use the computer in a good way and use it for things that it can actually be used for. so i think that the computers are avery helpfull to people that like seaching for stuff that there curious about or to have to use it for good needs.
0.7 dear local newspaper, in my opinion computers are a help to our plant. the new technology makes life easier to handle. the computer are a help because it teaches hand-eye coordination. you can talk to people, and it is a new way to be entertained. computers can teache hand-eye coordination because of typing. whether someone knows it or not when you are typing fast it is help you hands. also the fact you that if your typing without making is also helping because it makes your hand easier to move. the typing is giving your hand lots of exersise because your hands are moving all over the place. the more you move them the more excersise you can get. computers can really help hand-eye coordination alot. computers can also help by talking to people. to talk to people far away is better to talk to on the computer because if you have a webcam you can see each other. you are able to talk to people from different countries. also computers are able to be used in business meetings when a business has to talk with another from different locations. like if part of the business is doing a project in hong kong, then the boss can set up a meeting to see how it is going. another way to use computers to talk to people is to speak with a person you are not able to see in person. like if a oerson is in the hospital but you're not able to go, then you can talk while seeing each other throw the computer. computers are a great way to use in communication. computer are also a new way to get entertained. they can entertain you because there is games that you can play. there are games that come with the computers and a lot of games on the internet. other they being bored all the time you can play thousands of game with just a click on a mouse. also to not be bored you can watch videos like youtube. you can listen te musicor watch comedy videos. video also show a way do express what you feel and sat it in comedy, horror, or sad videos. also for teenagers there is ways to talk to their friends like facebook. on the website you can talk with anyone on your friends list. in the end computer can help kids, adults, or teenagers. with just a clicking your mouse you can find a new powerful way of technology. and be able to got better hand-eye coordination talk to people and get entertained. so go get yourself a computer and amazed!
0.4 dear local newspaper i think that usieng computers help people becuse if we did not have computers we would not now ehey thing about eneyone or eneything like all of the @caps i would not now eneything about them but with computers i know alot about them and there lives like @caps @caps @caps got shot in the back of the head and. @caps got shot to and i know alot about the @organization there white people that to fear in to black people and the same with the wars like world @num and world @num and the @caps and @person and the @caps war there was like plain spy palin flying across @location and they shot him down becuse we were trying to see if thay had eney nuculer bombs offer there. and the same with google and yahoo with google you can type in eneything and you will get a answer and most liked a corect answer yahoo and google is great for some worke and products end studying becuse you then you do to and that i think that computer are good.
0.7 @organization, @caps are many people in this world that think always being on the computer is good because they can talk with people online and learn more about the world. but, then @caps are people who disagree with them. i am one of those people. spending too much time on the computer can really affect your life. people stop exercising, don't enjoy the beauty of nature or life, and they aren't spending enough time with their family and friends. so, i hope that while you read through this letter, you take some of this information into consideration. first of all, when people spend a lot of time on the computer they aren't getting all of the exercise that their body needs. they become lazy and don't want to do anything. this is very bad because it will affect your health and the rest of your life. people @month become overweight and since they got lazy from always being on the computer, they won't go out and get the exercise that their body needs. people need to enjoy their life! by always being on the computer, they won't be able to. @caps are so many fun and healthy things you can do for your body. you can go play sports and have fun while getting exercise. many people do this and try to encourage their family and friends to do it with them. but, some of their family and friends are to lazy to do anything because they are always on the computer. instead, they stay inside the house all cooped up and don't get enough fresh air. this is a horrible thing to do to yourself. your body needs fresh air, so start enjoying your life a little more people! finally, people @month lose contact with family members of their friends because they are to busy on the computer playing games. i know i wouldn't want to lose a friend to the internet ever again and i don't think anyone else would want to either. i once lost a friend or two because i didn't talk to them as much as i used to because i had been too busy on the computer on @caps, @caps, and games. i felt horrible because i didn't realize that i had been doing that. i really wouldn't want anyone else to lose contact with a family member or lose a friend because of the internet. its horrible and you don't feel like yourself anymore. once again i would like to tell you that always being on the internet is not good. you can become lazy, not want to do anything etc., people aren't enjoying their life to the fullest and you can and @month lose contact with a family member or lose a friend because you spend to much time on the computer. i hope that after reading this, you realize that being on the computer is not always good for you.
0.6 dear local newspaper, i just read about your article regarding the computer usage. in my opinion i think that computers are a good thing. yet, i believe that it could have a negative influence as well. i believe that computers are one of mankind's best technologies. you can type, learn about historical happenings, different places, and different cultures as well. you can talk to people from far away by using chat or the webcam. that's what i use to speak to my @caps's who live in @location. computers are one of the best things that has happened to me and my life. however, although computer can be such a good thing, it can be bad as well. a lot of people over used it too. i infact know a person and she's a very nice person. she's sweet, caring, loves kids, and has a kind heart. the only thing is, is that she's a @caps addict. she loves @caps. sometime when she comes over, i'll be using my laptop and she'll ask to check her @caps status. my point is, is that she allows @caps to take over her. not cool. i read an article the other day about computer usage in @location. dr. @person covered this article on the topic of computer usage. she said  the average american spends four hours or more on the computer. although there are other people who spend their time outside when it's nice. i congradulate them on that . see, now you heard it from the expert as well. in cocnclusion, i would like to state that computers can have either a positive influence or a negative one as well. so it all depends on how you use it and how much time you spend on it. so my point that i would to come across @location is that use you computer wisely. don't spend all of your time on it. life's too short for that. so spend time with family and friends and go outside too!
0.7 dear newspaper, @caps some beleive computers do not benefil society, i do. computers help buisnesses thrive, keep people people aware of what is going on in the world, and allow people to stay in touch with each other. computers greatly benefit small and large buisnesses across the world. imagine all the jobs at each buisnesses without a computer. buisnesses would be unreliable because no instant contact would mean it might take a long time for products to be assembled and shipped. any buisness owner would cringe at the idea of running of buisness without a computer. when surveyed, @num out of @num buisness owners and workers would prefer a computers assistance at work. almost every modern day buisness relies on at least one computer. for example, companies that mass - produce their products often rely on computers to do jobs more precisely than a worker. sometimes computer operated robots do dangerous jobs so workers are not at risk. buisness also need computers to quickly recieve and send information to other buisnesses and people. buisnesses are not the only need for computers. people use computers as much if not more, than buisnesses. people like you and me use computers to keep in touch with friend and people we know. thanks to websites like @caps and e-mail people can easily stay in touch. families use computers to plan get-togethers. friends use computers to keep contact after grade school or if they do not live nearby. with computers, anyone that is anywhere can be in constant contact with anyone else. people also like to know news imediately. without computers it would be alot harder to contact the rest of the world. imagine a natural disaster accuring and not knowing about it right away. in that case we could not send aid to the area. with the recent earthquakes in @location and @location. knowledge about the rest of the world is even more important. newspapers provide news and information but a day or two late and they often use computers to aquire that information. eighty-seven percent of scientists agree that recieving information would be a lot harder.
0.8 imagine standing outside, the warm sun dancing on your back, jumping into the pool and feeling the cool water flow around you. but no, that won't happen. because children and their parents are spending way to much time on their computers. people aren't getting enough excercise, it can be very dangerous and families are spending less time with each other without computers, so its worse with them. i think people need to realize that computers are over the humans. humans especially children, need exercise. but with computers that isn't really possible. more and more children are becoming obese by the year. computers are making that happen quicker. instead of sitting at the computer eating potato chips, children should be outside on their bikes, or swimming, or playing sports with their friends. if it is winter, the least kids could do is go sledding. children need to expirience nature, not the screen of a computer. the computer can also be very dangerous. @num year olds are making facebooks! you can find @num year old on the internet now. naive teenagers go find  friends  in chatrooms or on @caps, and their  friends  lie to them, about their age, another indentity. many teenagers go and meet someone they met online and end up getting raped or killed. there are many sick people in the world, and many of them use the internet to find people. lots of teenagers give out personal information like their last name, cellphone number, or where they live, and thats an easy way for predators to find them. it puts them, and their whole family in danger. computers are breaking up families, and friends. things like @caps, @caps,@caps, farmpring, @caps, etc. are turning people against each other. some families even eat dinner at the computer. when friends go over other friend's houses, they just sit on the computer. why is it so fun to just look at the computer screen? families need to do something together like eat dinner together, go out for ice cream, go shopping, something, anything but going on the computer all day. i'll admit, i am a little addicted to the computer. but i don't go on it @num, like some people. instead of eating dinner at the computer, go out to dinner as a family. instead of online shopping, go shopping with your friends. it isn't hard to at back @num or @num hours of going on the computer. am i the only teenager who thinks this? maybe. but i know that i am benefitting myself by cutting back on the computer. we don't get enough exercise, it can become really dangerous, and family and friends should start spending more time together. computers can do everything more than humans can, and we need to stop it.
0.6 dear local newspaper, i agree that people are spending more time on the computers and less time doing other important stuff. for example, they don't spend time exercising, enjoying nature, and they don't spend time with their family. those are very important things that people don't understand that they are missing of. first, people that spend a lot of time on the computer don't do exercise. doing exercise is good for your health. if you don't do exercise when you get older your bones are going to work. also, you could get fat and that is bad for your heart. just for being on the computer people don't pay attention to their health. next, people don't enjoy the beautiful nature that is outside. is beautiful when you hear the birds singing or seeing the plants outside. people are forgeting about nature. they don't recycle so the planet could be clean. the air that we smell is not clean because they don't care about nature. instead of being on the computer they chould help so the world could be better. finally, people don't spend time with the people that love them. is very important to spend time with your family. people don't realize thats the first thing in life is your family. instead of being on the computer, is fun going to the beach with your kids, wife, father, and etc. in conclusion, i believe that computers affect on people. people just for being on the computer they don't do exercise, enjoy nature, and they don't spend time with their family. now that you heard my , i ask you to think about yours.
0.6 dear local newspaper, @caps opinion on the effects of computers is that some people are spending to much time on computers they are good to be on for a while but not all day. so @caps first reason why i think spending to much time on computers is not a good thing because it's better to be outside doing other activities with other people all day instead you could hang out with friends and do some sports or something else and if your on the computer all day you will start to lose some friends. @caps second reason why i dont think it is good to be on the computer all day is because if your not exercising you will start to gain weight cause your sitting all day just on the computer so its good to go outside and go for a walk or you could go to a gym so you could do exercise is good for you it will keep you healthy cause i know someone who is on the computer all day and he really does not go outside because he says that computers teach you alot and they do but it is not good to be on it all day. @caps last reason on some bad effects of computers is that some people could use these computers for bad things they could be going on some bad websites and that will just make you to be on the compute even longer you could even become addicted to being on computers because your doing nothing else ans some people have cameras on their computers and some people use them for same bad things so thats why it is better not to be on a computera ll day long. so these were @caps reasons or some bad effects computers could have on people if your not go outside to do some activities or to hang out with some friends.
0.6 dear local newspaper, i overheard some people talking about how much time their families spend on the computer. my opinion is that they should not be on the computer staring at a screen for long periods of time. i think this because it takes away time from important tasks, there is something healthier than enclosing yourself with a computer monitor, that would be going outside or being active. another reason is that you can have more time being around family and friends. first, you shouldn't be spending so much time on the computer. you could be getting other tasks done. such @caps working, or for most teens, doing homework. studies show that @num out of @num teens get easily distracted by social networking websites such @caps  @caps .  twitter , and  aol . people in the workplace are distracted two. sometimes the job can get boring, so workers just go on the computer instead of getting things done. children could be doing chores or just helping around the house a little, but they go on the computer instead. teens regular routine consists of waking up, getting ready, soing on the computer, school, coming home, snack, and then going back to the computer. we need to break those habits of going back to the computer. staring at a computer screen for long periods of time is not healthy. instead, you could be active in a sport, or just going outside and playing.  @caps technology goes up seizure rates have also gone up.  @caps to a doctor at @organization. being involved in a sport would be healthier and more fun that talking to people online. also, your not exercising while on the computer, being active keeps your shape along with being fun. the most important reason you shouldn't be on the computer for a long time is because your using valuable time you could have used to spend with family and friends. most people barely see their family when their at home because their consumed in the computer. laptops have made it easier to block people out. bringing it into your room and shutting the door, is the most common way. hang out with the friends your already talking to online, wouldn't it be better in person? in conclusion, we should limit our computer time to do other tasks, be active, and spend time with friends and family.
0.6 dear people that read the news paper and that have @caps that like to play the computer all day more. than a hour. i think you should take your time and read my article in this wonderful newspaper. i am writing this article about @caps using the computer more than an hour. my first reason about this computers issue is it makes than not pay attention in the school. to support that reason so you dont think i am making this up is that they play the computer alot and it makes the @caps just think about the computer and not think about school. they play it so much and it can mess up the @caps and they can not focus in school. my second main reason is it makes them allways want to talk about the computer. so if they play it mare than a hour like i said it can cause them to be addicted like drug's it is just like that if you dont want your @caps to be addicted to drugs i hope you woudnt want your own @caps to be addicted to the computer. to continue about your @caps can allways @caps about the computer it can make your @caps sound like they have no life because they play it all day everday and i would hope you woudnt want your @caps to be like this. most importantly my final reason why you shoudnt let your child play the computer for more than a hour a day. because they can get over weight. your @caps well only get up and go to the bathroom, and eat, they will only do stuff that is in the house. your @caps will not go out side and play and they wont get no exerse at all. i hope you will understand where i am coming from i have a brother that is offering in the hospital right computer too much and it messed and the doctor said he make it not so i am praying that he well make it out alive so i hope you woudnt let you @caps do this it will mess up their life forever. thank you so much for takeng you own @caps time to read this article i hope you would remember this article for your whole ontire life.
0.9 how @month times do you use the computer in one day? a lot right? i think that computers definatly benefit society. the internet helps a lot of people, because its very conveniant computer give people. the computers also lets people talk online with other people. computers help people because of the internet. the internet makes alot of peoples live easier. one way is for school. i know from my own experiences that the internet helps. if i dont have enough material to study, on the internet help. another reason that the internet is helpful is for jobs. did you know that @percent of people the age of @num have jobs on the internet? the internet can also help people find jobs. the last reason that the internet is helpful is shopping, i remember a time when i needed a special book for school and no book store and no bookstore, my mum ordered it of fine, the internet is very helpul to many people. my that computers are beneficial to our society is that they people the ability to faraways places. many people cannot offerd to go to a lot of places outside the united state., with computers, people can team about there places and at of these places. sometimes there is even a snow the experience of being there. another reason that are using and want to learn more. once, any family got to a wedding in @location, but we didn't know much @location. @caps we went online to find things like. the foods eaten there and what the weather is like. lastly people can learn about where their family corner form. if people know the place that their ancestors came from, but they look it up crime computers. they confind recipes for food, what relign they practice, and what holidays they celebrate. obuously computer help people about faraway places. my last reason that computers are beneficial to or society is that they allow people to talk with other people. sometimes, good friends who wants to together loss touch or if one friend, people can find online and take. did you know that their are many sites that tell you where people you went to highschool with are? also, there are sites like facebook where people can connect. another reason is that, people can meet other people online. their are many dating sites such as, that connect people losing that internet. did you know that @percent of people on dating, sites set ? sometimes people cannot call each other because its too long distance. being able to chat onlinee a sites like google, chat or all is very helpul. without a dubt, computer are very helpful. i think that computer help @caps many, people in our society. people use the internet to help them. people learn about other places and people ccan chat online. -@caps, dont think body about computers, because they have impaced our society greatly!
0.3 dear, @organization, @caps idea about  computers  is very well thought outside of the box.well. we sure need computer to look up information these days. why do we need them now and it dident existed before? reseach shows over @percent of @caps says computer is everything. let me explain a little bit further to you what i mean. first, you can look up places, chat with friends and family. @caps oppinion about using the local internet would be that it's good only for those who knows and not trying to be mean. for little world neve should get to bed at least @num pm, and never to forget about nature outside of fresh air. in conclusion, internet these days are very good for people.
0.6 dear people from the newspaper, i am concerned that people take too much time on the computer because it could cause trouble, voilence, & illegal crimes. first, i am concerned that people spend too much time on the computer because it couses trouble, in @date, @percent @date people in the @location, do bad stuff like starting rumors, & saying bad stuff about people they dispise, in the @date, @percent @date teens form ages @num were envolven with the rumor spreading. this would be bad for all children. all these reasons will lead to the @num below. secondly, i am concerned that people spend too much time on the computer because it couses voilence, because @date the reasons started in the @num paragraph, if all this continues, then it @month & lead to voilence, in @date @num people died from all the crimes online. @num threats were found online from big websites like @caps, @caps & @caps. lastly, i am concerned that people spend too much time on the computer because it could lead to illegal crimes, in @date a girl was talking to a boy online then when they decided to meet, he shot & killed her. it turned out he was just a person who lied about who he was online, @caps on a website online, a group @date men were talking about now much they hated kids so they decided to shot them @ their bus stops. thank god that the police caught them before they were to do the crime in conclusion, i am concenred that people are spending too much time on the computer because it causes trouble, voilence, & illegal crimes. this @caps like totally needs to stop before everyone is addicted to spreading rumors. thank you for your time in reading this letter
1.0 lately, a technology buzz has hit all over the world. where ever you look, be it at home, at school, at work, or on the streets, you see people texting, talking on phones, blogging, and other computer related things. this concerns some people. they believe that these generations are relying too much on computers and not spending enough time exercising outside or socializing. but here is where they go wrong. these experts are judging computers too harshly, for it's not like everyone is zoning out in front of a glass screen, sucked into the world beyond. @caps, most of these  computer geeks  are using the computer for useful things, while they are also used for entertainment, computers also help society to reconnect with long-lost friends or even get directions to a well-know resuraunt. as you can plainly see, computers are not turning us all into zombies. computers are sometimes seen as a nusence. parents complain about the many times they have to drag their sons and daughters from the screen for dinner or a soccer game that started @num minutes ago. but you see, this doesn't mean its bad. everyone goes on the computer.  even though my father complains that i'm on @caps too much,  @person, @organization, says.  @caps forgets that @caps has one of his own.  this is an example not unlike many other student's parents. about @percent of adults confess that they too have fallen into the new fads such as @caps, @caps, and @caps. so why do we need these things? what seems to make them so important to us? the answer is simple, it makes us feel connected. then again, if you think about it, maybe not so simple. many people have different opinions on why the computer is so important to them, but most agree that friends is one big factor.  everyone is already online.  @person, computer technician, informs.  @caps all your friends are in something, wouldn't you want to as well?  @caps, as the famous saying, @caps your friends jumped off a bridge, would you?, flashes through your mind let me answer that for you - @caps. being connected and diving off the deep ends are too different concepts. as you find friends from highschool or just friends from school, your glad that @caps you can talk to them face to face - or computer screen to computer screen - again. last, but certainly not least, the computer is a great resource. while some people complain, others are using what it has to offer by looking up directions to events or facts for your next report. this is how websites like @organization make billions from the words being typed into the search engine. the facts and places that arise from the computr are like gems waiting to be found. in conclusion, its easy to see why the computer and its resources are so loved. everyone uses it for different things and different hobbies. whilesome for pure entertainment, others for information, and another for reconnection. my personal favorite finiding the true treasure of hidden bands, the fantastic ones, that @caps one even knows. and so, this is why i'm convinced the computer is a positive impact on the world.
0.5 to whom it @month concern, i feel that computers are a great in most people lives. one you can use them for almost everything. two computers are good for you in many ways. it shouldnt affect dailey schedule or just being with your family. people can use computers for almost everything for one their are hundred of websites on the computer. for example, you can play games all different kinds, you can also chat with people, litsen to music, watch videos, look for places and a whole lot more. computers are very useful in many different ways. computers are also good for you. they help with you eye cordination. you can also go online and do practice on math, social studies, etc. the internet also has a lot of eduacting games whiten is good for people who had that extra help. it also helps you with you hand cordinations because on the computer you need to know how to type. you get realy good at it you can type without looking. a computer can not get between you dailey schedule or whay u do with your family. because a computer is a computer you go on it if you need something or you go on it just for fun for example i havea computer at my house and someone goes on it everyday and it never affect what everybody does us kids still go to school my parents still go to work, we eat dinner together we do what we have to do, and the computer never gets in the way. as my conclusion i know that computers are good to have in peoples houses. one you can use them for almost everything. two computers are good for you. three i shouldnt affect your daily schedule in anyway.
0.6 dear, @caps i would like to tell you something. throughout the ages we have been evolving, from caveman discovering fire to discovering how to fly. with evoloution we discovered technology and in recent years we have been making new technologies rapidly. some say that some technology like computers are bad, i think that computers are good because they give you the ability to learn about for away places. let you talk to people online and teach hand-eye coordination. computers let you go places that you ordinarilly wouldn't be able to go to. if you were doing a research projects on @location and you didn't have any books what would you use? that's right, a computer the internet would have the facts you needed, so you could grade. while on the internet you could talk to friends and family who @month live for away. the computer goes over long distances and connects both computers so you can bend writing almost instantly. without computers you wouldn't be able to get in touch with these people. using computers is good for the body as well as the mind. it helps you with your hand-eye coordination. when you see things on the screen and go to chick it you are actually helping out your body. some people say that when you are on the computer you aren't interacting with friends and family, but they are wrong. i myself have talked with my sister in a different room while using the computer so the computer lets you interact with friends and family too! i love computers, don't you?
0.7 dear local newspaper, @caps would you like to be warmly greted by the zingbobway tabe @organization @location, say hi to a far away family memorr again or maybe quicker your relfexes? well you can! computers are a use ful way @organization complexing an @organization these tasks. imagine your family member or friend fighting in the war miles away. wouldn't you want to see them at least once? computers allow you to interact with them with webcams. you can see them and talk with them. not only can you talk with family, you can talk to friends. you can make new friends from around the world without leaving your house. you can have a new best friend every day! not only can you talk to people on computers, they give you better hand eye coordination, and they quicken your raflexes. dr. @person, @organization,. says  @caps have shown that people who type or use a computer have better reflexes than those who don't.  @caps a computer around is easier for school also i remember one time, i had to write a @num page paper for @caps and it was due the next day. i wrote the beginning @organization it and my hand started to cramp up. i had in finnish my paper soon so i ran to my computer and typed it in half the time i would've spent writing it. i also got a good hand-eye coordination . not only do you type on it, you learn on it. @num out @organization @num computers are used for learning about place and people. say you just won @num free tickets to go anywhere in the world with a celebrity at your choosing! with a computer you could research anywhere you want and make that trip the best days @organization your life. and even if you don't like actually going to other places, you can virtually go there on a computer. with computers you can see the @caps @caps @organization @location, the tropical reef fish @organization or the @organization at the. computers hold the world at your finger lips. so as you can see computers have a positive effect on people. computers allow people to interact with cites, increase your hand-eye coordination, and allow you to have the world at your fingertips. so stop reading and use a computer!
0.6 dear @state news, computers are a great machine to use. people can research, learn about any topic or subject and let people talk to friends online i think that computers have a good effect on people. computers are one of the great inventions we have. they are very helpul in our everyday life. when people need to write a paper for school or do a project you can research what you need if you need to know some thing about, a topic that you don't know about, you can look up questions you have about it on the internet. if your writing a paper and need an answer its all on the internet. suppose you want to go on a family vacation to california you can plan your whole trip right on your computer, you can book a flight, get a hotel room and even see what there is to do you can see the whole world right from your computer. if you want to learn another language you can learn an entire language on your computer. also if your to busy to go to collage or want to take another class there are even schools online. the computer is a great way to learn about new things. finally you can talk to friends online websites like facebook and myspace are great ways to keep in touch with your friends. naother positive way is @caps you can instant message friends and family without having to wait so long for a response back. if you want your friends you can just message them. i think that computers have a positive effect on people. they are helpul in many ways such as people can do research, learn about new things and talk to friends i hope, you see my point at view they are samething everyone should have.
0.9 dear reader, @caps, people have been debating whether or not computers are actually benefiting society, especially now that the majority of @caps now own one of these helpful machines. computers help people with everyday tasks and are no doubt doing more good than harm. imagine how impossible it would be for most people to do their jobs without them life would become much harder for the people living on this planet. think of the successful schools in our country, and then think of which of those schools don't have computers. computers are the easiest way to look up information, something important when children are learning. whenever someone needs to know something, they just google it. this comes in handy when researching for that huge project due next week. people have never been so knowledgable. computers are only important for school, but also in the work place. they serve almost the same environments. now that computers are so common, people can conveniently type up a paper and submit it to their boss or teacher. it saves time and effort with a more professional result. computers also serve the important purpose of communication using email or instant messaging, one could communicate with someone on the other side of the world without that enormous phonebill.some @month see this as dangerous because you could be chatting with a complete stranger. however, it is also opening your eyes to new cultures. now it's possible to learn about life in @location first hand. if computers were no more, it would be extremely hard for a regular person to interact with someone from another country. it's almost like isolation from the world. there are many out there who take great interest in learning other languages. better ways exist than sitting in a classroom listening to someone talk. as a person on this planet, do you really want to be kept separate from others just because they don't live close enough? a main concern about computers is that no one will want to read books and anything else. however, a recent study shows that after computers came out, more people have begun to read. this proves that just because there is now something fun and new, it doesn't mean everything else is trash. people will still continue to do things they always did, just with something new on their list. in addition, it is the option of everyone w/ other or not they want to spent their time on the computer. if someone doesn't like the idea, they've no right to take it away from someone else computers were created to help the human race not control it. if a person doesn't want one, they don't have to get one, everything is up to them, and that is the way it should remain. the next time you see a computer, don't think of it as some sort of obsession that's keeping people from doing other thinkgs they could be. but as a universal device that allows them to broaden their horizons and learn things they probably wouldn't go to the library to look for comuputers aren't holding anyone back, but pushing everyone forward, whether at work, school, or even the house, they benefit everyone, everywhere.
0.8 computers, a very much talked about subject. did you know that @percent of homes in @location own at least one computer. and that goes for about @percent in @location. some people don't like that this is true, but on the other hand some people do. i have a computer, it can do so much, for example it can help me with writing, i can play games on it and socialize with social networking sites and  i.m.'s , it can even help me order a product form a website like @organization, @location, or @location. like i said, i have a computer and i can use it to help me write. at school in english, i would use my computer to help me with a writing prompt. i also use it to write conclusions for science labs. there are a lot of other kids that do this as well, it really is very helpful. that is only one of the reasons i think computers are beneficial to society. another reason i think computers are beneficial to society is because you can play games on them, like  world of warcraft ,  @caps @caps @num , or classics like  @caps @caps @caps . there are millions of people that play games on the computer. also you can socialize with social networking sites, like @caps and twitter, and also because you can  i.m.  your friends. i.m. stands for @caps messaging, and it is kind of like email except it is just about instantaneous, and so you and friend can have a conversation over the computer. also there is video chatting, where it is kind of like a phone except you can see the person you're talking to and it is over the computer, so it is almost like you and the person you are videochatting with are meeting face to face, but your not. a third reason i feel that computers are beneficial to society is because you can order a product over the internet form shop websites. for example, i got my @caps from @location, and also the bulb for a @caps in my house is wearing out, so my dad is going to buy a @location bulb on @organization. it is things like this that make life that much easier for the @caps@number @person, because this way these people don't have to drive to the store to buy something, that is, if they can wait a week or two for the product to arrive. these are the kinds of things that make me feel that computers are beneficial to society. i know they might not be the best reasons, but they are quite important to me. being able to type essays, play games and socialize, and order products form websites is just amazing. these are some of the reasons that i and others love computers. but i have a question for you, why do you like or dislike computers?
0.7 computers definitely have a positive impact on society. they help organize your thoughts, which stress. so, they contain many inspirational articles which can convince kids to strive for surless. lastly, when all else fails, the computer can be a great way to relax and clear your mind. computers help organize your thoughts, which helps reduce stress. imagine you working on a project in school. everybody can add to it, and you can selectively choose which additions you want. in addition, you @month also block the programs that you don't want. this device is called the computer, and it's changed @location's society for the better. on average, @num out of @num @caps suffer from stress. now if you organize your thoughts on the computer, and are able to look through them again at why a huge alleviated. instead of worrying thoughts you @month or @month not remember, you now have confidence that you can look back and find your thoughts right on your @caps. reduced stress trading to confidence effect on society. also, the computer contains articles that @month insure our children to strive for their goals. once child read an article @person, @organization book. as an @num using @person as well in school. by games, i observe how into @caps since i started seeing @person as role model to me, high making a stride for a @caps.o @caps. where did this inspiration come from? researching @person on the internet. the internet, in this instance, obviously had a positive impact on @caps society. lastly, when all else fails, you can rely on the computer to make stressful situations seem less overwhelming. if you have the ability to solve a problem, then why can't you solve it? often times, the answer to this question is that the situation is too overwhelming. if you take a break go on you @month relax simple games put out a variety of websites. now say you came back and attack the problem again. you continually chip away at it, and it seems overwhelming. thank you computer gods! the computer, in this instance, has made - positive impact an @caps society. so as you can tell, computers make a strong, positive impact on @caps society.
0.7 dear @caps, in many ways computers are helpful but, i don't support the use of them. the advance in technology has really taken away from peoples lives all over the world, some examples of this are lack of exercise, too much time inside, and not enough time spent with family and friends. continue reading for more on as towny computers do'nt benefit society. as you know, when you use a computer you usually sit in a chair to do so, correct? well, this activity is doing only one thing, not keeping you healthy or inshape. i'm sure that you want to be healthy, and to be healthy you must get some sort of exercise through out your day, and sitting on thje computer is not helping you one bit. so as you can clearly see, so far using computers is not beneficial to our society, continue for more cons of using computers as much as they are used. believe it or not, using a computers is unhealthy, and not beneficial, in more than one way. the reason for this is because, not only oo you not get enough exercise, you won't go outside as much. you @month be wondering as to why not outside is unhealthy, but it is because you dont recieve the needed amount of fresh air that you need to not be sick. could you imagine the amount of people that would be sick if everyone used the computer for the majority at their day? well, lets just it wouldn't be fun to count them all. now that you know two ways that computers are not beneficial to society.keep reading for one rest way. as you probably knows, it is a hard task to keep a big family close to each other, and using computers is'nt going to anything to help you. so, why use them? trust me, spending quality time with your family and friends can be just as much, or even more fun than playing your favorite computer games, and in my opinion your family should be the most valuable thing in your life, so don't lose them for a computer. now that you have finished reading. i would like to thank you for your time reading this letter concerning, lack of exercise, too much time inside, and not enough time with family, is not beneficial to society.
0.6 dear town @caps paper, i would have to pick being for computers. there are a couple reasons why i'm for computers and they are being able to talk to friends online, being able to learn stuff, and you can also play video games. one reason that i would be for computers is so you can talk to freinds online. so if you have a facebook or myspace you can talk to your friends all day if you wanted to. what i mean is simply by typing in what you want to say to your friend they will receive those exacte words then they'll reply. for example if you wanted to just say hi then your friend would look at his/hers messages then just reply. so being able to talk to friends online is one example why i for computers. another reason that i would be all for computers is being able to learn things. so if you wanted to learn a language then you would go to google or something and try to find a fast easy site. what i mean is if you goto google a whole bunch of site's will come up, so what you want to do is find the fastest easyest site for you. so being abe to learn important things like a language is another reason i'm for computers. the last reason for me picking computers is because you can play video games. what i mean is if you were borde and noone to talk to then you can get on your computer and play a mind numbing game or an educational game for class. for example in science class we played a game on the computer and it had to do with gravity and that was what we were learning about so it was an educatinola game. so that is the last reason why i'm for computers. i'm for computer because you can play games. so now you know why i'm all for computers. i am for computers because you can talk to friends online, learn stuff and play video games.
0.8 dear local newspaper, have you ever thought about all the intresting things you can do on computers such as call people, order groceries, and read books for school. today it seems like the world is held together by technology and i think computers are at number one.  @caps my older sister moved to @caps it was hard to keep intuch and see eachother, but we found out about @organization, which is a site where people all over can add people and chat, call, or webcam eachother, so we do that everyday and it's like she never left home.  @person says about the internet site @organization. @caps sure @person and a lot of others love their computers. studies show that @num out of @num people get more done in the day online @person says  everyday my day is shortened because my @caps because while at work i can order my groceries and have them delivered by four o clock @caps i arive home from work i can make doctor apt, school apts and schedul meetings all with one touch/click where ever i go, instead of looking on the calander or picking up the phone. @percent of couples today say they met online via twitter, facebook, myspace or aol. the internet is great for meeting new people because you @caps eachother and get to know one another or look at their profile pictures and things. you cand find peolple just like you online and after a while the two of you are friends. i have some of my best friends online through a mutual friend's page and it's a sucessful friendship today. even schools took education to the web, with all books from a class avalible at home online. students can even check grades online now and recieve comment from teachers. so now students are pushed to use the web at home and at school. i hope i have opened your mind a little to understand the internet is not all bad, and people spend so much time on them now because everything has moved to the web like school, stores, food, even tv you name it the web has it. personaly i spend about an hour or two on the web chating, studying, watching tv. after i might go walk or play my @caps but i'll still conected to the web because the @caps picks up on wi-fi connections. so i think computers let you open up and connect with others and get other things done on the web. i hope by now you feel the same

0.5 dear local newspaper, @organization's benefit society imensely. they help us learn about far away places, they help us with our school work and the let us communicate with other people online. we need computers. computers allow us to learn about other countries, people, @caps etc... how would we learn about places we might want to go on vacation? or how would we learn about the places we want to see, and the places we want to stay away from? we need computers to do this. we would never even know of some countries if it werent for computers. next computers help us with our school work. sometimes we get project spend most of them involve research! computers make this a whole lot easier on us. also instead of lugging your text books from school to home and back, we can use online textbooks. why give us extra work, it's a waste of everyones time. instead of wasting your minutes talking on a phone, you can chat online. wasting minutes is wasting money. who wants to do that? besides using the keyboard to chat with friends will help you in the future. @num out of @num studens, say they prefer to talk online then to call someone. computers benefit us by easy aces to info. computers are a lot easier to help us with school work, than textbooks are. lastly computers let us talk to other people online. without computers everything would be so much harder.
0.6 dear local newspaper, i think that computers have a exellent benefit for people. first family friends can communicate from a far distance. secondly typing on the computer gives people good hand and eye cordnation. thirdly they give people the ability to learn about faraway places. lastly it gives student a chance to research a topic they are learning about. well @caps do you think? researcher @person said that almost @percent of family's live faraway from eachother. computers give the ability for familys to communicate wether its aim or a webcam chat. also out of the @percent of familys that live faraway from each other @percent use the computer to comunicate. hand and eye cordination, some people type without looking and some people are really slow. typing on a computer give the great hand and eye cordination. good hand and eye cordination could be used for many things. for example, playing sports or even a simple task like throwing something in the trash. lastly, have you ever wanted to learn about a place faraway from you live or have you ever researched a topic for school? well i have. computer give people the ability to learn about places faraway. for example in the third grade i had to research hammer head sharks. don't teacher always ask their student to look up a word or a topic on the computer? as i have said before i think computers have a benifit on people. i hope that my three reasons of contacting family and friend and hand and eye cordnation and lastly researching has made you think it a good thing too. thank you for taking time to read @caps i had to say and i hope you take it into concideration.
0.6 i believe computers have a positive effect on people. they teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and even allow people to talk online with other people. all these things are good so why not use computers, we need computers. do you think computers are a positive effect or a negative effect? after you hear this you might want agree with computers have a positive effect. computers have a positive effect in so many ways for example: school, work, talk to other, and just get information. from different websites. if we did not have computers or use them we would probably use books. we would get information from the books but not as much as we would get from the computer. we probably would not know that much if it wasn't ofr computers. the reason why computers have a positive effect is because you work your eyes and while you are typing you are exercising your hands. that proves hand-eye coordination. we learn about places we don't live in like that? had a earthquake we went on websites for that. you get to learn how it is in a certain place you want to go on vacation for. you get to learn about famous people you do not know about so all you have to do is go on the computer and look up your celebrity. computer is something people use to talk to people and keep in contact. now we have @caps, @caps, @caps and others. we use that to talk to our friend and family. some of our family or friends live in far away places so we use the computer to talk. if you have a e-mail teachers and people at work might have to e-mail each other to handle business. you can even get work for students at school so that way the can learn more and do different activities. you can even play games on the computer. you can explore nature on the computer. i think computer is a great way to learn and talk with others. do you want your child to learn? do you want your child to have fun? so tell me what you think! computers have a positive effect.
0.6 dear local newspaper, @caps name is @person. i am @num years old and i go to a @organization in @location called @organization. i am a really smart kid. in @caps opinion i benefit people using computers. you should keep reading @caps essay because i am going to tell you @num good reasons why i benefit people using computers. @caps first reason is they teach hand eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about far away places and people. for example, when i am always using the computer and when i'm doing research it always gives me the ability to learn about new places and people. another example is when ever i watch @caps.v on @caps @num it says that people learn about learn about faraway places and people on the internet @percent of the time. @caps second reason is it allows people to talk online with other people for example when i am on the computer everyday i visit @caps facebook it always gives me a chance to talk to @caps friends and other people online. another example is when i go on a computer and i search computers.org it says that it lets people @percent of the time talk to others online. @caps @num reason is it allows students to get information when they're doing a project. for example when i always use the @organization computers it allows me to get information for example, about @location and @person govina that is why i benefit people using computers. another example is when ever i check out a magazine on computers it tells me that kids get alot of information when they're doing projects @percent of the time. in conclusion, i benefit people using computers because they teach hand eye coordination, gives people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, it allows people to talk online with other people and it allows students to get information when they're doing projects. those are the @num reasons why i benefit people using computers. so please the local newspaper please try to make this believable.
0.5 dear @caps @caps, computers are all around us where ever you go. you can learn things on them or play games. although computers are all around us they do not have a possitive effect on people because, harmful people could findout where you live and they are too addicting. where ever you look you can find a computer. at home, in school, in your car, at work, and hotels. being exposed to these computers are helpful. everything we see now a days is run by or has a computer. in the future we are going to see more and more computers. buisnesses practically run off of computers, soon they will run them by thereself. also with so many computers it creates jobs. you can make computers, program them, fix them, and even supervise them doing work. even though everyone says they are safe on the computer, they are not. while on a chatting website you could meet someone and they might be a child melestor or a. they can find out where you live and when no one is home or when you are home alone. with your address they can even look at your house on a website or possibly get your houses blueprints. then they can come and leave you mentally scared for life. there are tons of things you can do on a computer. for example you can play games. there are games with virtual worlds or games that are fun and have no meaning. either way games on the computer are too addicting. you say you are going to play for @num minutes but they are so addicting you play for @num hours. the games just suck you in and your stuck. although computers are all around us they do not have a possitive effect on people because harmful people can find out where you live and they are too addicting. computers are good and bad at the same time. people need to know when to stop using it or it can drasticly change your life.
0.5 dear, who ever this concerns some people are to obssesed with computers. they usually stay up all night playing games or going on @caps. the people who love computers rarely iteract with people they like to be left alone with no one bothering them. some people that go online to research stuff are probable being lied to maybe someones just messing with them. if you love computers so much that you stay up all night and don't get any sleep then you miss work and you get tired then you know you have a problem so quit. you dont want to stay up al night. because you could have something important to do and you miss it like your childs party becuse you husband or wife typed to wake you up. but you didn't want to go you miss it and your child never trust you again when you stop interacting with other people you really got a problem because you need want to go any were but to get junk food and soda. computers all the time is bad for you sometime you get cranky when someone takes it away that is when you need to realize what you are doing and go get some exercise is what you need you got to get some or you end up unhealthy which is bad for you and you want to stop that habit and get a new one. when your write a report you tend to go to the internet. it @month be agood sorce but it could be lying and you could turn in the worst report ever you @month of copy and pasted but you could still the not have to be your reliable sorce use your use a good good book. the internet is a bad thing it could consume you don't use it all the time the people make computer should shut all the computers world for one week so we know how it is with out internet.
0.7 dear local newspaper, i think that computers have a very positive effect on people. @caps reasons are that they can educate @caps, they make things easy, they are enjoyable. below, i will explain each reason. firstly, its very educational. computer are like a giant resource of information. many teachers @month direct their students online @caps learning purposes. also, alot of people go online to research information @caps their school, job, or a project. great websites that are packed with information, like @organization, can only be accessed using a computer. @caps example imagine having to do your research using only books, but you live far @caps a library. the internet makes that research very easy, as you access to @caps any time! secondly, they make things very easy to do. computer provide people with many easy, convieniant ways to do many tasks. if there werent any computers in the world. don't you think that interacting with people around the world would be challenging? almost all of the @caps/@caps in the @location like @person's, @organization, or @person's have an online website to aid shoppers & they even allow them in buy things online, which is way more easy than going by car. i remember a time when i wanted to by something @caps a store all the way in @location i went online at home and bought @caps there! also, @caps makes things like ordering @caps, getting plane tickets, getting help alot much easier & @caps saves time! thirdly, computers are very enjoyable! they provide alot of @caps things to do! @caps example if you are bored you can get on computer, & search @caps a game you enjoy. there is always a game you'll like. on of all of that, you enjoy @caps by talking to your friends and family. you stay in touch, while enjoying their company. another good thing that people enjoy about these computers is because they can send things to one another, lightining @caps@number because of email. imagine that you don't have a phone, and you wanted to tell your husband that is away on a business trip, that you son is very sic. if you send @caps by mail, @caps take at least @num days. by email, only a couple minutes so, you can see that computer also can provide some @caps of safety @caps everybody! so, as you can see computers have a very positive effect on people @caps ways that they do this is that they are educational & they help @caps learn. they make things like ordering @caps, getting tickets, or contacting helpl very easy @caps, they are very enjoyable, @caps playing @caps games, to staying in touch with your friends and family. don't you think that without computers we'd probably suffer? i think computers have a great effect on people
0.6 dear local newspaper, people spending time on the @caps is a good way for people to connect with one each other. but it can also be a way for people to get in trouble with things online like looking at things they shouldn't be looking at strangers they shouldn't be talking or typing to or even predators that could be online. @percent @organization kids and adults go on the computer either when their getting out @organization school for the day or if they are getting off @organization work for the day or if they are getting off @organization work for the night, they are just there on the computer to check upon things and for the kids either for their entertainment, for like chatting with friends on some king @organization program, or @organization their even playing a game online. three fourths @organization kids under age @num go online more than adults age @num because @organization the interest in what is on it. people sometimes say,  oh, i only go on the computer to check up on things. it only takes me a few minutes , but they are lying. most people dont just go on for a couple @organization minutes, their on for more like a few hours, and that effect their relationship or connection to ones family and or friends. @person at the @organization says,  people spend hours on the computer looking at what ever they want and most people do that and it has to stop for the sake @organization the persons family and friends,  @person also said,  @caps like an addiction . do you really want to have an addiction? i didn't think so, so instead @organization just sitting there storing into a screen for hours aday go outside and have fun with your friends or family, go to the @caps, the beach, even just take a walk in the park. nothing can beat the feeling @organization being with friends or family and just having fun.
0.6 dear @organization, i believe that people should be able to go on the computers and still be doing it. for a good reason such as communicating with far away relatives. another reason is, if you need a @organization work-out or healthy eating tips, you can just print them out. and my last reason is if you're going on a far away trip but you don't know the way, you can just print out directions (@organization). say if you have a relative that lives all the way in @caps but you can't call them because you live all the way in the @location and if you call them, it'll cost you about @money per minute. what you can do is you can contact them over the computer (webcam). and it's way better than just calling them because you can actually see them. or if your on a business trip away from home, you can check upon your family. my second reason is, you can stay fit while being on the computer. you can look up @organization  yoga  poses. or you can also do fitness lessons while watching them off of your computer. and if you're on a diet, you can look up @organization healthy recipes. you can also get @organization work-out equipment that'll make (or keep you), nice and slim. my last reason is that if you're going on a long journey away from home you need to now the way. but, what if you don't know the way? you can go on the internet and look up directions. and that is way better because at least you arent wasting money on a @money @organization. and it is more and quicker. and the best part is that you don't have to keep looking at the @organization and program stuff. with the maps on the computer, you can print it out and actually keep it. those are all my reasons to why people should really go on computers. there are many things that a computer can do which is really good. you can communicate with relatives, stay fit/healthy while on the computer and getting maps. i hope that this opens up many peoples eyes. and maybe change a couple scientist's mind.
0.8 welcome to the @date. in this day in age, numerous advances in technology are being made everyday. the one advance that has stood out above the rest is the invention of the computer. for just one invention, the computer has many capabilities: @caps access for educational purposes, keeping people in touch, and opening people up to new aspects of life. the computer has helped mankind with various discoveries about our world. as far as many can see, this piece of technology has positive effects on people everywhere, everyday. the new trend in schools all around the globe is the addition of computers or a computer lab. the reason for this is that this technology takes learning to places it has never gone before. whether a student has to write on essay about the presidency of @person or obtain background information for a science experiment about paper towel also bency a computer can aid them in finding the information they need. programs like @organization allow @caps to present their work in a new and efficient way. for children that don't  school or adults that want a college education, computers let them learn what they need to from online schools. it is also important to @caps that they can keep in touch with friends after school hours. computers are able to help them with this. how many times has it been said that communication is key to a healthy relationship? computers, believe it or not, are on easy and way to maintain contact with far away people. some friends and family keep in touch completely by computer. because they don't live close enough to visit daily. if one is cautious and uses internet safety techniques they can make new friends with common interests through computers. this contact with new people is just one way that computer is croaden one's horizons. computers are like keys; they open doors to new places and ideas. the use of this technology can old people in discovering so many new things they have never known before. computers can help open people up to unique genres of music they have never listened to before. on the internet, there are many video tutorials that teach people different skills for free. in one's spare time, they could use a computer to research the people of @location or the pyramids of @location. any way a computer is used has the potential to have a positive effect on someone. in the @date, computer are essential to evey day life. it is imperative that you decide whether you are for this remarkable pece of technology or against it. it is astounding what you could learn from just hopping on a computer. especially keep in mind that computers are for more than just entertainment: they're for education as well. so what are you waiting for? discover how great an impact computers can have on your life with just a click of the mouse.
0.6 dear @organization, this leter i am writing to you is about how computers affect people. i am concerned about computers use in our society because people that spend too much time on the computer spend less time outdoors, exercising, and with family and friends. let me tell you modre about it... as stated in the paragraph above, one reason i am concerned about computer use is that less time is spent outdoors. everyone, young or old, should get outside for some fresh air for at least @num minutes everyday,  @person. using the computer could limit this time, and that probably isn'@caps healthy being in the house all day. a second reason @caps worry shout over- usage of computers relates to the first reason. too much time on the computer limits the amount of exercise you get everyday.  people should exercise an hour a day to stay healthy,  ssays health expert @person,  however @percent of people don'@caps because of computers.  this happens often especially if you are playing a fun game with many levels. you plan to play for @num minutes, but the @num minutes turns into @num minutes, which @month even turn into an hour! i know still @month be hard to understand why i'm concerned about using computers, @caps i have one more reason. my final reason in this letter of why i don'@caps like over using computers is that it limits the time that can be spent with family and friends. how of you can see your family and friends on the computer using a webcam. but it's not the same as spending quality time.  friends come and go and you and your family won'@caps live forever,  says therapist @person , @caps motor the best of that you have.  there won'@caps be many if you eyes are glued to the computer screen. as you can see there reasons why i am concerned about people spending time on the computer. there's less time to exercise enjoy nature and interact with family and friends. i hope you take this into concideration.
0.8 dear @caps @caps @caps, i believe that computers have a negative affect on people. computers have caused problems where kids do not do any types of physical activity which deprives them of their daily needed exercise. also, children spend so much time on the computer, they don't get a chance to enjoy the outdoors. another effect computers have on kids is that @caps stops them from spending time with family and friends. i don't know how people can sit on a computer all day without moving around. first, kids don't get enough exercise because the spend too much time on a computer. we know almost everybody has a computer even i do, but @caps doesn't mean @caps has to be used @num. i am a athlete and i enjoy being on the computer, but i don't use @caps every second i can. doctors always reccomend everyone to get a least an hour of exercise everyday. most people don't do that. they would be the kind of people who uses the computer or a different electronic a lot. that is also causing childhood obesity. if all you do is sit on the computer all day, your going to be someday. but people need to get off the computer and do something like a sport or even a game like. if you don't exercise you wont enjoy the outdoors. second, people are not enjoying the outdoor. if somebody likes to play sports they shouldn't don't on @caps for three hours instead they invite a couple of friends to lay same basketball. even walking home from school with a friend is a good way to be outside. people @month think during the winter there is nothing to do. have a snowhall fight with some friends and enjoy your selves. nobody should feel embarrassed even if you wanted to play tag with a friend but you're @num. just get outside and do something. there are millions of things to do that isn't going on a computer. you're a kid so long that you have to enjoy your selves now before your serious with you life. lastly when you're not outside you're not enjoying yourself with your friends or family. people are spending too much time on the computer and less with friends or family. you're not hanging out with you friend if you are chatting on @caps. is @caps so hard to tell them online  @caps @num come @num my house.  @caps takes two seconds. then in no time you will be hanging out with your friend. i don't understand why is @caps some embarrassing to be with your family. mydad and i like to go and play basketball or ping pong with each other. we don't care becaue we have fun. find something your parents like to do and see if you like @caps. @caps isn't hard to say to a friend or parent,  @caps to do something.
0.7 dear @caps, @caps much do computers affect our life? i have always thought of that question. technology is getting up to the roof and it makes our life more easier, but have you ever thought that maybe technology might take people's work? in everyday of our live we see something new that comes out and becomes an easy tool for us. but what about us? since technology come out people has become not the same; for example cars, by having them people doesn't walk and not even exersice, they don't spend too much time with their family and friends and lastly people miss thousands of wonderful things that happend outside. i just think that technology like computers take a whole quater of our life by mostly doing the work for us. first, have you ever, notice that people get obiese so fast? i know the answer to that question. the obesitity in @location is getting worst, people are getting fattier by just been in a cautch and sitting with a computer and eating, what exersise are they doing there? people doesn't exersise anymore, instead of them playing games like, soccer, volley-ball, baseball or even running, @caps!! they are at the computer playing games that doesn't do anything good. i have asked people about what they think about this and this is what a woman answer,   i htink that people doesn't think about their health, they just think to make life easier . i agree with her; obisitty could bring you to the hospital and you don't want that. second, have you ever asked your self about @caps much time you ever spend with friends and family? well think of that. maybe you got a computer because you were spending too much time outside bu not with your family, but you can see that you're probably most of the time at home since you bought your computer, but not with your family. spending time with your family is so important because you might miss so many wonderful things. for example family parties, or just watching a show on the t.v. i just think that spending time with your family is important. lastly, if you are a parent and you are too much in a computer, won't you feel bad if something happend with your son/daughter? in everyway we always miss wonderful things, and sometimes we loose it because of technology, you don't want that right? imagen you are at the computer and your daughter said her first word won't you feel bad if you missed that? i would. always give time to life because maybe one day you might hate your self for missing so many wonderful things. in conclusion, so many people have become addicted to computers, they just can't lieve it alone. imagen that you become one of them. you becoming obise, not spending time with family and missing wonderful things that the world provides us. i hope you understand that technology is not everything in life.
0.8 do you have a computer? i'll bet @percent of you do! you @month spend @num hours on the computer or even @num hours! computers in fact have many down-sides to them. you could be so invoilved that you never go outside or get excirsize. also, sitting @num inchs from the computer screen does not help your eyes. lastly, the internet has very inapropriot websites that kids should not be seeing. are you a kid who spends @num to @num hours at a time on the computer? well, if you are, it's time to get off the spinning computer chair and out for soem fresh air. most kids spend most of their time on the computer @caps or on @caps or @caps. it @month be good for kids to interact with kids out of school but sooem kids take it way to far. they never go oitside and get any excirsize. this is not good for a growing teen. they need to be up and active. so, limit yourself time you spend on the computer. without a doubt, computers are very bad fro youe eyesight. unlike @caps or video games you could play a long distance away, a computer is played @num-@number inches from the over time, your eyes will be so use to sitting @num inches from what your recating, that when you back up you  erad at all. i knew this who played video games from about @num foot away for long period of time a day. today, unfortunately, the kid is blind if that kid just knew the consequences of being that close to a @caps screen, he would have thought twice about it. think twice about how close you sit from the computer. if i were to ask anyone of you what you could find on the internet @percent of you would say,  anything.  could there really be too much information? as a matter of fact, tehre is. you could be looking up a topic and something inapropriot, that has nothing to do with the topic comes up kids doin't need to, and shouldn't be watching or seeing these inapropriot sites. its bad for kids, so stop it! after reading this essay, i hope you realized that computers are bad for you in various ways. as a matter of fact it's physically, mentally and socially. so, next time your on a computer, don't look at the little things, but the big picture!
0.7 dear @caps, @caps since electricity was invented technology has developed at a rapid rate. computers have gone from the size of a room to twelve inch flat screen monitors. in our modern day society computers are crucial tools that help organize files, do reasearch, and pleasurable online networking. computers teach hand eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about far away places, and allow people to socialize online. without computers wouldn't life be difficult? while routinely doing our everyday computer tasks seldom do we realize that we are writing which frequently over works nerves in the hand causing tendonitis or arthritis; typing on computers is quicker and less harmful to the hands.  hand eye coordination helps improve balance and athleticisniry.  said @person the chief othopedic sergeon of @organization. some people beg to differ and believe spending not less time on the computer can contribute to lack of physical activity. there are several portible computer devices that can be brought outside to use while walking like a @caps. every since i was, ten years old i dreamed of going to @location. although i couldn't afford a plane ticket to @location, i was able to use the internet to take virtual tours of the vibrant landscapes and ancient historic venues throughout the country. with the help of internet i was able to see a far away place and experience the country as if i was there. @person, the creator of an online webcom called @organization. @person created this computer system in order to allow people to connect all over the world by giving them the opportunity to see and speak to anyone they chosse to. i frequently use this program to talk to my sister at college. through this program we can't socialize with as if she's at home and learn about her college experience.
0.6 dear newspaper @caps, i am writing this letter on behalf of all the busy people in our country. we have come to the conclusion that we need, not want, but need computers in our life. first, we need them to communicate to other people. second, we need computers to do research for school and work. lastly, us kids need computers to type essays, prompts, or papers for each class. communication is very important in everyday life. for instance, i have a grandma that lives in @location. i only get to see her once or twice a year in person. throughout the entire year, i video chat with her through @caps computer because it is a whole lot easier than flying there. without computers to video chat with @caps grandma, i have no communication with her they one or two times a year. using a computer for communication is extremly helpful it allows you to do so many things without travelling for, like video chatting. another reason why computers are a neccessity in our is because reseach for and easier. many kids nowadays have so much homework and spend on the internet. for i myself, that i. the internet is a quick way to get the reseach. plus, the research i have found is just as accurate as a book from a library. computers are absolutly needed when kids have a load of homework and projects that need to be researched. thinks when the time a to, kids have to type up essays and prompts that its unimaginable. just in the @date i had to type on english, essay and a fluently paragraph. final grade @caps i did not type it, on a computer. typing things on the computer cames out of school also, whole @caps dad is frequently typing up and he is also typing up essays for his company. many things nowadays in order to be perfect, have to be written up on the computer or you will not get the result you were hoping for. in conclusion, computers are modern devices and you are going to have to live with it. computers provide great communication with everyone around or even across the country. also, they make research for school become a lot more efficent. finally, computers type papers and essays up faster. computers are a neccessity for living.
0.6 dear @caps @caps, i have recently heard about the debate on whether or not computers are used too often. computers can be unhealthy, i think that generally they're helpful. they give us many oportunities that wouldn't exist without them. i'll describe more of what i mean in the following letter. first, i'll explain one of the advantages of computers. studying and school work. computers can provide people with ways to research things. for students, it @month be something like research for a project of essay. for adults it could be information on starting a business. in both of those cases, computers were used to get information in a simpler way then perhaps visiting a library, i, personally, know of a website called @location, where teachers can set up online tests for students. this would not be possible without computers. computer online courses can even taken, where a student can be taugh through the internet, rather than in person. this can be an advantage to someone that can't always get to classes. i would also like to mention that computers provide a popular form of communication. e-mail and i @caps. these methods of communication have become extreamly popular recently, and i myself use both. i think for some people it can be bad because it prevents them from interacting with the real world. but in general i think it's helpful. it also gives parents and teachers another way to communicate. these are just some of the many ways computers are helpful. lastly, i'd just like to talk about how computers can benefit adults specifically. i know that many people pay their bills online. this is becaus if you think about it, isn't it a hassle to have to mail your bills every month? computers greatly reduce that hassle. they can also make it easier to buy things you need, look for jobs, and many other things. without computers, things like looking for jobs would require a lot more work than they do with them. these, again, are only some of the hundreds, if not thousands of ways which computers are helpful. in conclusion, i think i've made my point very clear. any thing in moderation is okay. people that argue that computers are unhealthy speak of those who use computers too much. generally this is not the case. usually computers can do much more good than bad, and can make a persons life much easier. they help very much with education, and even that alone i think should be enough to convince you that computers are helpful. but as i said, i hope i made my point clear, and i hope you agree with me.
0.7 dear local newspaper, i feel that computers are very beneficial to our society. they are very helpful when it comes to homework, you can talk to people online and you can make plans/ without even leaving your house. first of all, computers help us a great deal with homework. many kids are adamant about it, but with the help of a computer, they will be more willing to get it done. for example, when i have a difficult science/social studies assignment, i can research it on the computer. also, @caps i have a just coming up and i left my textbook at school, i can just study on my computer. so, as a result, computers are very helpful with homework and studying. secondly, computers make it very easy to communicate with others. for example, talking on the phone costs money, and why would you money when you could text, chat voice for free? also, many people use e-mail because its very easy and you can send documents to others. lets say, that i had a work document on yearly company profits and i needed to got it to my boss. no problem, i just it to an email and i don't have to drive. finally, my last point, computers make it very easy to make plans or connections. i know that @num out of @num people love to travel, but you need plane tickets. just go to the website and do it online. its fast, easy and safe. also, @caps you needed to make reservations for something, like a hotel, you just have to go online, pick a date and when you arrive your room will be ready. i can see how this would be very beneficial to traveling business men who might need a room for the night. in conclusion, computers play a huge roll in the world because they can help with homework, its easy to communicate, and you can make /reservations without even leaving your house. and the best part about them is that they are fun and easy to use!
0.6 dear local newpaper editor, i think computers benefits us in a good way. weither computers are helping kids with research for homework, projects and essays or building online stocks to help make buisness grow. computers are now a benificial way of life. we can see what happens on the other side of the world. and learn about new things everyday. what i think people are focusing is what they thikn computers are doing to people, but are really not focusing on how it helps us in so many ways. one way that people say computers effects people is that we don't exercise instead were attached to our computers. i doubt computers do this not everyone likes or wants to exercise. and why would computers stop people from doing that. it's people choice, the computer doesn't forces them to stay in the house. and computers are a great way for you to catch up with friends and family. it could be online chatting and even sharing photos. and i highly doubt people stop seeing their fmailies because of computers it just doesn't make any sense. people who are against computer are giving people in chairs or controlling them, it's just silly. if people acually stopped to take the time and think; theirs a chance that they would see how computers has helped us grow as a nation. and how much they used computers and that it really helped them than just searching through books for a ton of information. as years have gone by i could see that a ton of thinhs are runed by computers and that alot of people use them. and it has impacted our country, in my opinion a good way. and if it wasn't for computers who knows how are nation would be running. and if computers amde such a posotive impact on our country already i can only iamgine the years to come as computers become bigger and better. so as you have read i gave mt reason as how think computers impact our lives. and how i think the years to come it will impact our lives bigger and better. now i can't force you to be for, or against computers bbut what ever your opinion is just think of a world without computers especially if you grew up with them.
0.6 @organization, @caps computers are a part of our advanced technology. they have a positive effect on people because computers make almost everything easier, they can teach people things with tutorial or educational websites and @caps @caps, and they keep people entertained in their spare time. computers are becoming more and more advanced everyday and that's why i think people are so addicted to them, yet they do have positive affects. computers make things a lot easier for a lot of people. if you really think about it, a lot of things that we use every day such as books, nice clothing, and music on the radio would not be here if it weren't for computers. we would have to hand write those books and hand sew our clothes. as for the music, we would just stomp our feet and clap our hands to make music. if ancient egyptians had computers, they would have built millions of @caps. our computers have programs like microsoft to help me do a major school assignment neatly. computers have positive affects in this way. everyday after i finish my homework and i go on the computer most adults think that all that us teenagers do on the computers are facebook and myspace. i do admit that i go on those websites, but if i notice that my grades are not in the best condition, i go on websites that can help me understand what i'm not getting. ninety percent of the time that i do that my grades go up and i get a satisfying grade. i have also taught little cousins of mine how to add and subtract using the computer in pre-school. computers are helping schools teach students. besides education, computers can also keep us entertained with games such as virtual solitaire. when i go on the computer, i might need to research something that i have interest in. maybe i might want to know when @location was invented or, if the universe ever stops. maybe i don't want to watch @caps all day to keep me entertained. computers will save me from bordom. when i use a computer, i am not addicted. in fact it has a very positive effect of me. yes, i might stay up countless hours, talking to my friends on facebook, but to me that's a part of being a kid. the next day i might learn something in school that i want to search deeper into. that is what the computer is for. without computers we would not have some of the knowledge we have @caps. their effect is the most positive effect on people, ever in my opinion.
0.6 in my opinion having computer is good to have. therefore i think having computers are a good thing because nowadays computers are very useful. also a lot of people are using the for there businesses. my there reasons are to look up information, home work, and to talk to friends and family online. my first reason is to look up information on the computer. if you have thred reports to do it will best to use a computer to look up the information because it will be easier and faster to do. for an example using the internent will be faster then looking for it in a book. for that it will take at least @num to @num minutes for the interenant if you were to lookingit in a book it can take at least @num to @num minutes. my second reason is to you could talk to your friends and family online like if one of your relatives live long distance like in @location then you can talk to them on your telephone or cellphone because the bill will outragouse. or if you talk to your friends online so can ask them a question on homework or whats the homework? like if you have a that to like @location you can to online and you can talk to them. my third reason is that you can even do your homework on the computer. if you have history you can go on a website for an online book instead of bringing a book to school and back to home. also it will be easier for that you would not have to worry about bringing your history book with to home. for the example it will take less time using the interneat the using a book it will take like @num to @num minutes using the computer then using the book for @num to @num minutes. in my conclusion using a computer is very useful and very important nowadays. my three reasons are to look up information, homework and talking online to friends and family. even though people don't like computers or don't like to use them.
0.6 @organization, @percent of the world say that computers are a good way to interact with people, learn about forgien people and places and also learn about where your family came from. so here i am going to inform you about the good reasons why computers should stay in our society. how do you meet people from different countries? one way is interacting with different people all over the world. i am saying this because the internet has a lot of benifits in meeting people. one way is to make a certain account where you can meet people who aim or a different account. another way is go on a website where you can pen-pal someone from a different place in the world. the final way is to download something where they can send instant messages to people all over the world. do you have a project where you to learn about another country or another explorer? well you can use the computer to learn about the place or the person. i am saying this because that will helps us with all the work we do for school. computers also help you with your school work by helping you with homework. i am saying this because with nobody home when nobody there when you come home from school who is going to help you with your homework you can use a website that helps you understand the material better. do you know where your family comes from? a way you can find out with your family come from is use a website to find where your family comes from. for example, @location is a helpful website to learn who they really were in life, were they fight in a war. you can find this all out on the computer. another way is you can ask your parents the name of someone and type there name in google.com. there are many reasons why we should could keep computers but here are some, interact with people, learn about other places and learn about family. i hope you understand this better.
0.5 dear newspaper, i think computers are good for many things and are useful for anyhting. i believe this because every year new and exciting @caps and websites are created and make life easier. for example,  @caps  is a way to communicate with friends and family. for me i have family out-of-state, and i am happy when i go on @caps and speak to them. or i can also talk to friends after a long day of school. another example is  youtube.  on youtube they have how to videos that show you step-by-step instructions on anything, even on news and music entertrainment. other @caps like word, help you set up writing essays and @caps stories. on powerpoint it lets you make slide show videos for school projects to presentations. even excel let's you make graphs and any char t imaginable. and let's not forget @organization. @organization helps you when you need info on a person, place, or thing. and by useing @organization it helps you when you need information for other @caps like word and more. see, computers help everyday people wiht everyday life.
0.8 dear @caps of the @organization, @caps has been a debate on whether modern computer activities are good for people or bad for the people. some people think that it benefits society because computers can teach hand eye coordination, they can help people learn about faraway places, and allow people to interact with friends. al of this seems to prove that computers are good for society, but truely it is not. people who use their computers too much can have some harmed side effects, including obesity, red eyes, and even can get cyber bullied. people are using computers to an extent to which it is bad for their health. the number one problem of the @location is obesity. it seems that people are getting fatter every day. computers are definetly taking part in the problem. people are spending too much time on their computers and are spending less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. these people are spending hours and hours in front of a computer getting heavier every day. they start to eat their feelings because of how lonely they are. this process continues until the certain person can barely yet out of their chair. obesity is not the only problem that is damaging their health, their eyes are being damaged also. it is obvious that more & more people are having problems with @caps eyes everyday. computers are making this happen. when a certain person is on the computer for only an hour, they are damaging their eyes tremendously. the computer screen is straining their eyes horribly & for the people who are on the computer @num - @date hours a day are pretty much sending their eyes to blindness. when i go onto the computer for only @num minutes my eyes start to water. it is a devastating outcome of using a computer too much. computers are damaging peoples health & @caps should be something done about it. although computers aren't only damaging people health they are also ruining peoples lives. bullying has been a major problem in the @location for many years. kids would be bullyed all day in school and always had a horrible time. but when they got to go home they could be comforted by their family and friends. computers have recently included a system where you can video chat with friends or @organization. this can be a wonderful thing unless used in the wrong way. as i pointed out before kids are bullied a by in school but when they got home they were able to leave that horrid life behind and be a normal kid. not any more. this new @organization, video chat, @caps, etc. has brought the unlucky bullied students a one way ticket to getting cyber bullied. i have heard of a case where a student was cyber bullied to such an extent that she suicided on the internet to show how depressed she was. computers made that event possible. video chat, @caps, @caps, etc. gives bullies a chance to make their prey depressed into a point where they consider suicide. i can understand why you would contradict my argument but i truely hope that you will be able to understand why this is so important. obesity, straining the eyes, & cyber bullying should be in my mind enough evidence that computers are bad to get you to write an article about these horrid machines. they are causing a variety of problems in peoples health, mind, etc. i really hope you will consider writing this article.
0.5 dear, newspaper @caps my name is @caps, @person and i think that this idea based on why people need computer is a good statement/ @caps. my @caps oppinon is that same say people use their computers so much they don t yet exercise. when that is not true do to the fact that computers have. programms on how to watch your weight. stocks and etc also technology helps people around the world on websites, programs such names as to video chat, @caps.com for instant messaging. on the way teen stuff like computers help people for on video chatting, emailing people their rezemates to jobs on why and how their based. on showing people their recent jobs. and giving details on showing people reading this article is that technology of computers also help @caps save. most reasons we need tech equipment is that people use it on fields such as the navy, @caps, dealships, all over the world industry. why is that good well my point of view is that business need that to order their stocks for store carriers and more. for @caps on field to use for @caps sean, pregnacy, pulse radar's and more. and on the negative point of those side of the readers are based on the mostly that people get addict to technology when the truht is that people really need technology look around you and everything in this world has mostly been made by technology and. the @caps is that people should agree. that computers help people, speak, @caps, email, lives, help find family, friends, give directions, so on my point of view @caps tel your dean @caps and readers that interacting with technology. is a good way nto control ways on how or what you do in the computers do to that in my way i make sites audio and interesting technology can allows people on ways to help people. find and create ways to making money or interesting positive out comes out of using person in this world goes in and thru out tech equip. these days, and to the people who have read this article should pass this story on to people who take technology on negative terms and to help them think about it positive.
0.5 dear @caps @caps @caps, @caps you think computer have a positive or negative affect on people? i think it has a positive affect. there are a few reasons for this. first, computers are used for education around the world. second, it helps us connect with and meet new friends. lastly, you can use a computer for world news. as you can see, those are just a few reasons. first, computers are used for education around the world. for example some people use it to go to college online. others use it to find information on things like egypt, where we cant go. second, it helps us connect with, and meet new friend. we can chat with our friends, which is very useful. if we need to know what a homework assignment was we can just chat with a friend. lastly, you can use computer to find out about world news. we can go and find out if something serious happened, like the earthquake in haiti. as you can see, those are just a few reasons i think that computers have a positive affect on us. i hope you agree with me. 
0.6 there are many great things about computers. if we were to loose them then our lives would change dramatily. you can use computers for exercise then it is also up to the @caps on limits. last it can save lives computers are great, if we were to loose them. there would be no more internet. you would't be able to talk to friends on @caps or e-mail. cell phone prices would go through the roof. we would technacly be going back @num to @num years. last with out computers there would be more diffeculty in large companies computers can help exercise. one way is we can find closest gyms on the internet. we can find what is healthy to eat right away you can also get one of those @caps fits for a computer. also you can find free work out videos. next, it should be up to the @caps. it is their discretion if they see that the child is spending to much time on the comuter and gaining weight they can easaly limit it. they can say for very hour your on the computer you have to do an hour of exercise. lastly the computer can save lives. before computers medicine like tylonal was used for everything. stuffy nose, headache, cold etc. now we can go on the computer to find weather the medication is at all dangerous. you can also find the nearest hospital. finally, computers can do a lot of good, even though it can make less unhealthy if you spend to much time on it it can save your life. it can also destroy companies and our lives, @caps can give limits and computers can used to exercise. so reading this essay please don't take away our computer
0.9 wouldn't you agree that spending time on the computer takes away half of your life? going on the computer can have a negative effect on you! personally i think not going on the computer benefits you, @caps's more time for your family, going outside, and staying healthy! certainly going on the computer will mean less time for exercising. for example, lets say you went on the computer for an hour, that hour could have been used to go outside and stay fit! think about the choices here; you could either sit on a chair and play on the computer or take a nice run and burn a ton of calleries! statistics show that @percent of people that go on the computer instead of getting exercise, are in risk for health problems including obesity. as you can cleary see going on the computer really isnt the healthyiest choice to go. most definatly going on a walk or enjoying nature is better than going on a computer. a girl named @person, from @location  i love to enjoy the beuty of the outdoors that god gave to me i wish i knew that years ago while i was a lazy woman on the. if you just even look out your window to see this beautiful god created for us you would want to go out there and enjoy @caps! everyone wants to live like there dying or in other words live life to the fullest! in order to do that you have to see life and go out there and experance @caps, not sit on a computer! without a doubt this world is gorgeous and @caps is worth while to see the nature! everyone knows that family comes before everything! for example, you might love the computer but that love should not over power your time you spent with your family! one day on a @date night @person was on the computer and her mother called saying,  @person @caps's time for dinner , @person ignored her mom and chose to go on the computer! now you really cannot give up time with your friends and family since they are so important! i know with my heart and saw that my family means the world to me and everyone shown more time for each family member, not the computer! its now or never to decide if computers benefit society or not! with no computers you could have so much free time for your friends and family if you could only imagine! most importantly @caps will not only benefit you but @caps will mean a lot to your family so what are you waiting for? get off the computer and spend some qulity time with your family!
0.6 dear local newspaper @caps, i do agree that exercising,. i think that people exercising more, and spend time with family and friends. the issue to with is should more people sometime on their less time, exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends should it be the other way around. the first reason why i think that people should spend more time exercising than on their computers is because i think that more to watch and watch the way they eat and keep that self fit because what responsible to see their kid eat and then out exercising and then then self. my second reason is i think that people should time enjoying nature then computer the reason i think this id because they would never would never know what going on computer. how can you never things do. my third reason is interacting with friends and family i think that people should friends and family then on the computer because interacting with friends and family you learn things that you never knew about then and you can places you never gonna be sure discover new things you never your life. for example over vacation i did things and things about my family and friends than i never know why because i people interacting i learned how fun they really are and intering and happy. have fun where is the computer. please don't your life live your life. it's now or never should 'people spend more time on or more time exercising. interacting with family and friends.
0.4 dear newspaper people, i think that the effects that computers have on us are good. you should agree. one reason why you should agree is because computers are like teachers. for example, you can go on websites that teach you all kinds of things like math. also you can go on cyber school or take college classes online. another reason why you should agree with me is because on computers we can communicate easier. on computers, you can e-mail and use a webcam to talk to people. you can also have a facebook or myspace to chat and learn more about people. last of all, computers are for our entertainment. on computers, there are lots of games to play that are free. also online you can watch movies and listen to music. last, you can have fun creating games and stuff to share with everyone. without computers we wouldn't be able to do any of those things anymore. i think that it would really suck and tons would agree with me. that is why you should agree with me that we
0.6 dear local newspaper, i think people are spending to much time on the compture an these are my reasons, less time exercising, an enjoying nature and interacting with friends an family. my reason is less time exercising people are to busy on the computer playing games an talking to other ones. dont you think you should be outside doing some exercising like running around or playing sports instead of being in your house on the comptuer doing nothing. people should at lest get @num of exercising. you could be on the comptuer for a little while but not on it @num. take a break from the comptuer an go outside for a little bit injoy the weather an being outside. people just cant take @num away from there comptuer time i find that really hard to belive that people cant. its like the comptuer took over there brains an all they want to do is be on it an never get off. my second reason is enjoying the nature go outside for a little bit an see whats going on there go take a walk outside in the woods an look for the animals or look for animal tracks. there are a lot of fun things you can do outside like climb a tree or going fruit picking. you dont have to be inside all day an stare at the computer playing games an talking to friends. you could be outside injoying the nice weather you are getting. peopl need to learn that there is better things to do with there time. my third reason is that interacting with friends an family. it inportant you spend time with them an see how they been an what they been up to. but instead people are always to busy to talk to there family members becuse they are always on the comptuer doing stuff they dont need to being doing. there are a lot more inportant things in life an people need to understand that. family is way more inportant then being on the computer but people these days they put family second because they never want to talk to them or see them because they are always so busy waisting there time on the comptuer. like checking there email is fine but waisting your time on these chat things like @caps or @caps or @caps its just a waist of your time people can hang out an do things they dont have to be on the computer asking there friends that they should just call them an ask. dont get me wrong i have a @caps to an it takes away from your hanging with family an things but i make time for i can hang out with friends an family an enjoy the natuer an i do exercis. so i dont see why its so hard for people to do that. so in conclusion i think that people do waist there time on the comptuer to much like i said there are more inportants things in life an things you can be doing like exercising, enjoying natuer an hanging with friends an family. so i hope you take my ideas an consider them an thank you for listening to what i think. i hope people can get it through there head that they dont have to be on the comptuer @num.
0.9 with more and more people using computers. i think that this does not benifit society. i think this because mere cases of suicide are from online bullying, people get @caps addicted that they don t exercize and become obeast, and because it is bad for the environment. now more than ever before people are bulling. but not just showing kids around like they use to. now the bullies found a new way, by starting web pages, emailing the person, or making threats online. with the internent people say things that they would'nt be able to say in person because you dont have to see face to face all the time. did you know that @percent of all teenage suicides are from being bullied online. the bullies get into that person head and cause them to hurt themselves because they let people get to them. if we didnt have as many people going online then the youth would be more protected from online predilors. as you sit on the computer and play games or to friends, you are most likely caling. well when you eat and stay on the computer you arnt exercising. well, more than @percent of obeast people say they don't exercise because they are either to tired or dont have enough time. of course you are going to be tired if you sit for a couple hours staring at a computer screen. when they say they don't have time but yet they spend an hour a day on the computer. that dosnt make much to me. obeasity has becomea big concern it is the main cause of head problems. @caps get active the enviorment is a big concern these days. with toxic, the @caps layer and skin cancer on the rise. but how does the computer? well computers use energy and let toxix for environment. killing the @caps layer @caps the are much more powerful, hurting people. yes and plant do help the @caps layer but when you print you @caps you @caps very hard to keep up with the demand of and the demand of the @caps have to eat, but with out trees, plants they eat? by the time our children's childrens are here, there @month be @caps to no wildlife left, barely any wilderness and without the @caps layer many people will die of skin cancer. all because we are @caps addicted to using the computers. people lives, health, and the environment are all big issues that computers help to distore. how would you feel walking into your childs bedroom seeing them on the floor dead from being bullied on the computer. or see a loved one suffer from heart problems due to obeasity becasue they couldn't get off the computer. or in about @num years the @caps layeris completly distroyed due to the computers, with @caps to no wildlife left. using computers does not benifit society. sure its a quick look up. but @caps are books. the computer has every thing a local libeary has. @caps stop being lazy and get out. put a stop to suicides, obeasity, and hurting the environment.
0.6 dear local newspaper i believe that computers are a great help to society i will explain my thoughts and ideas to you. i hope you agree with me after reading this. for starters, i would like to say that my first subject is communication, computers allow us to talk to everyday folks or folks that are around the world! there are many ways to talk, text, speech, and webcam, and it is not like you cannot talk to them there are hundreds of communication cients, servers online @num usually, so you will always be able to someone! secondly, i would like to say computers have a great way of creation. on a computer you can program @caps, design presentations, documents, drawings, maps, graphs, almost anything you put you mind to can be virtually made. you can gather information from servers websites, @caps, @caps @caps you can create and learn a lot on your everyday computer. i am not fisned! there are @caps, @caps, @caps, reading, book sites all on the web! this gives the opprotunity of the  web searcher  to have a vast ammount of information! and allow he or she to learn alot more in every day life. finaly, i would like to say that computers has a wide range of entertennent! there are many to choose from like videos, movies, @caps, @caps, games anything that is suitable for the user or users of the computer. on a game a user @month talk to friends, while @caps a game such as a (@caps @caps) for example @caps@number @caps @caps online, @caps @caps game. these kinds of games skyrocket entertennent lovers for the vast ammount of enjoyment they can endure while @caps a @caps @caps. another type of entertennent is videos people can watch videos and movies on a video and more website which has a database of not thousands but millions of videos and movies. whatever the user wants is a text and a click away! the last type of entertennent is @caps and @caps, these allow the user to daily life or take to friends, family or relatives. to sum this all up i would like to tell you local news paper that you should agree that computers are a good thing for the society! please reread and pick the right @caps!

0.7 dear @location, i @caps believe that using computers has a benefit to the community. i believe this because using computers helps with research, jobs, and staying in town with people. first and foremost, the use of computers will tribute to better research. most @caps dont have textbooks about @caps or @caps at home with them so they rely on the internet. when @person gave the class a parket, i didn't know what some of the words meant. so i logged into my laptop and went on google, within seconds the definitions wore popping onto my screen like pop rocks. after i found out what the words meant, i finished my homework in about five minutes. without the internet i don't know how long it would have taken. equally important, using computers will allow a wider selection of jobs. @percent of today's jobs in @location require some kind of computer work. some jobs require quick typers. some people type as fast as cheetah runs. some jobs require people using @caps or @caps - computers are a necessity to get a well - paying job. lastly, using computers will open a gateway communication @caps, @caps, @caps, etc are a few of the many ways to communicate online. if one of my friends doesn't have a phone, they most likely have a @caps. @caps gives me a way to talk to, @caps photos with and leave videos for my friends. one @caps @person, @person, and i were all going to work on our @person project. @person's phone was taken away so the only way i could talk to her was on @caps. did you know that @percent of @location has a @caps, @caps, of @caps? to @caps, i hope you enjoyed reading about how using computers helps with research, applying for a job, and communicating with family and friends please @location, @caps this in the newspaper so all residents of @location will agree with me.
0.7 you need to gather information for a project you're presenting in school, but how are you going to find aout about your topic quickly and easily? most people will turn to one of the most commonly used piece of technology in the @location, the computer. the computer is used for quick and easy research, interacting and communicating with friends and for personal entertainment. some peol argue that the computer will take away from enjoying nature, spending time with family and friends and exercising. but what if we didn't have the computer? the possability of research, etc. would be much more difficult. for example: computers help us learn about almost anything quickly and easily. this could help make work for school or jobs less stressful. also, a computer can be accessed right in your name, so no travel is required. the computer has programs that are used to prepare articles, essays, slide shows and brochures for presentation, as well. if we didn't have a computer, research would be much more of a struggle and could require travel. computers are one of the most common ways to communicate with friends and family. websits and e-mail helps you keep intouch with anyone around the world. you can write e-mails, access live chat or even webcam. e-mailing is just like mailing a letter except it is dilivered instantly and doesn't cost anything. there is also no risk of anyone reading your mail. live chat iswhen you chat over text on the computer. webcam is face to face interacting which givs off the effect of talking in person: @caps benefit is that communicates over the computer doesnt cost a thing. lastly, computers provide games for your personal entertainment, which helps kill boredom. the computer also helps improve hand-eye coordination, along with staying orginized @caps, pictures, videos and more can be placed in files and saved on the computer making it easy for you to open them at @caps time. computers @month take away from some activities but think of how much harder and more stressful things will be without it. i think that the computer has a good effect on people as well as it being a helpful piece of technology.
0.7 computers are great, they can help you with anything you need. you can shop on then, pay bills, even book a flight to go on vacation, but people are spending too much time on them. they should only spend a certain amount of time on them and not all day. many people are spending more than enough time on the computer people ran often stay on the computer for hours and not even relize it, they stay up all @time doing work, or playing games. @time a while it will eventually take a toll on the body. because @caps you are on the machine all day then you are using little to no energy at all. so then you spend @caps nights in bed tossing and turning. then that leeds to feelings horrible in the @time, @caps you do it @time it is going to have a bad effect on your body. i believe that people who spend all their time on the computer will eventually get overweight. @caps you are sitting in a chair all day then you get no exercise what so ever. then when you eat you don't burn off the calories so that leeds to people gaining wait and becoming over wait from that your body becomes very unhealthy and will most likely leed to health issues. when people are on the computer they end up ignoring nature. they miss out on being in the wonderful warmth of the @caps @caps, or going out and playing in the snow and making @caps, forts, or having a @caps fight. they even miss out on just going outside and talking a walk the reason is because they are @caps @caps inside their house with their fare glued to the computer. being on the computer takes a lot out on the body. it can cause health problems and even problems in general. so people should just spend a part of their day on the computer. the other part of the day they should be outside, walking around, maybe playing with pets, children or friends. as long as they're out of there chair and not on the computer and getting some exercise.
0.7 dear local newspaper, to my understanding computers have been putting a bad effect on people of all ages. in my opinion staying on the computer all day can cause you to miss out on outdoor activities. also if you sit on a chair all day, honestly what will happen to you? you will become less active. in past experiences i have learned that if you get interested in computer game it will come very addicting. computer put negative affects on people of all and i think we should stop and think about what we are doing. most likely if you stay on the computer all day you will indeed on activities such as sports. @caps example @percent of americans play soccer. in the beatiful fall when the leaves are beatifully changing you will miss out on playing soccer and the beaty of the leaves because of the computer you can't get your eyes off of. another breathtaking adventure that you @month miss out on is hiking. hiking can be amazing when you get to the top and you see on the houses that have people like you (cach potatoes) sitting inside on the computer. simple activities can be lost because of an addicting game you call fun. the computer is like a cause and effect. you @month think you just playing farm town or chating on facebook, but in feture you will be missing out on the beauty of nature and sports. to connect @caps's with missing out on sports because of the computer that will cause you to become over weight. a recent study showed that @percent of children are obeased because of computer games. you @month be thinking how, but i have a friend named named, @person and he used to love to play out side and play sports until came out @caps the computer. now he way @num pounds and he is only @num. honestly sitting in a chair all day will cause you to not be active and gain weight. do you want this to happen to you? help me tell others how computers cause a negative effect on others. lastly playing on the compter or chatting with friends on @organization can cause you to @caps example if your talking to your girlfriend in spain who is there @caps callage i garentee your going to put off school work, @caps and other @caps that need to be done. in the end it will end up being time @caps bed and you got nothing done weather it was because you were trying to get to level @num or talking with your girlfriend you will have nothing accomplished. if your not yet a resent scientific study reported that six hours on the computer per day @caps one week can @caps your vision from a @num @num to @num @num. if you keep it up now it @month not seem bad but @num hours looking at the computer can kill your eyes. would you rather be blind or not use the computer because or what could happen? all in all the computer is a bad thing such as useful piece of technology can cause you to miss out on events such as sports. also it leads to being overweight sense your not getting active. finally the computer is bad @caps your eyes and can cause you to procastonate. help me help yourself avoid all of these bad effects caused from the computer.
0.8 dear @organization newspaper, i firmly believe that computers do have a positive benefits on society. these advancements in technology can only enrich peoples lives. one way computer help is that students can do their school work online and see their teachers pages. another great thing about computers is that whenever people need information or details on any place or things have can count on the internet to help them out. most importantly they are a vital source of communication. people depend on computers for their scheduling and keeping in touch with everyone that they know. without computers students would have it a lot worse. when a student forgets the homework, they can just go on their teachers online page and check what he assignment was for that night. another thing that students benefit from are online textbooks. if a student can't manage to carry home @num pounds of books they can just use their textbook online. nowadays, the internet is filled with lots of great information and educational site. teacher also can allow students to research for projects online and participate in online educational activities. not only do computer help out educationally' they are probably the must well known information centers. if people want to see about a restaurant, store or product, they can do that online. also, many people want to go to destinations but do not know how to get there. the internet provides them with directions for them on how to reach their destination in a quick and efficient manner. an extremely important and helpful aspect of the internet is the ability of purchasing and ordering items online. before someone decides to but something, they can find out all sorts of information about the product and shop around for the lowest price. people can even order groceries to new house if they are busy! i strongly think that the internet is the number one way of communication between people. for example, the team manager of my soccer team always emails me times and locations of the next game or practice. i would be lost and confused without these emails what i depend on. buisnesses also heavily rely on the internet to keep in touch with their clients that keep them in buisness. the use of web confrences saves a lot of travel and it allows the company to be in buisness with all over the world. above all, people depend heavily on social networking sites to keep intouch with friends, keep up to date on the news, and have fun talking to people. without the internet, probably half of the world communications would be down and that would not be good. computers, without do have positive effect on society. when it can be an educational resource it is very helpful. also, it is the best information database known to and is probably the most used. most importantly, wihout computer the world would be a mess without their main source of communications people know not to spend too much time inside and he always know when to go outside have some fun and get some fresh air. therefore, computers have no negative effect on people and they remain an essential asset in everyday life.
0.6 did you know that computers are the number @num selling electronic device in the world? i think that computers are only making our soceity a smarter and more inteligent place. also computers help old time friends and family keep in touch. finnaly i think they are helping are society because computers teach great hand-eye coordination. studies have shown that @percent of the people growing up with computers at home have a high paying job! computers are very intelligent pieces of equipment and if you know how to use a computer you will most likley hae a high paying carreer. also mostly every job from doctor to police officer to casheer at a store all involve computers and to go those jobs you must know how to work a computer. this is only one of the many reasons i think computers will benifit our soceity. secondly, i think that this price of technology benifits soceity because it keep family, friends and workers in touch. have you ever had a time where you think back and wish you could see your old high school friends or even family living. far away, @caps computers are one of the most popular ways to do so with all the new websites like @caps, twitter or even your old email website people are keeping in touch all over the world. another way computers help old time friends keep touch with the new video camera in the computer, family, friends and workers can actually see each other from different parts of the world. a simple message though one of these websites will make someones day and could even make yours. finnaly i think that computers benifit our soceity because they teach hand eye coordination other life skills. how do you think people can shoot a gun so and so quickly or how do you think a baseball player can swing at such a perfect time. all these things revolve around hand-eye coordination which is best learned by computers. also people can save lives by just a type about a hurricane, tornado anything but if they do not know how to work a computer many people can get injured or die. these are only three of the many reasons i think computers benifit our soceity. so think twice about the negative comments people say about computers.
0.5 dear local newspaper, @caps of all i would like to say that i love your story and puzzels in your paper and i think i have a story you guys can use. it's about people that is addicted to computers. i guess you guys wondering about what i mean about addicition to computers. well im going to give you three reason about this. my @caps reason is people isn't spending a lot of time with there family. i say this because most of the time couples get into arguments because the person thats addicted to the internet isn't doing want he/her is suppose to do. for example say you have a turkey in the oven and your so in the computer you forget all about it until the fire alarm goes off. another reason why people can be addicted to the computer is because all the online chat rooms they have. i know people that's addicted to online chat rooms and i sometimes get worried about them because half of the time they don't know who there talking to! it could be anybody even a pedafile. my final reason is because some people just don't care. some people can be on the computer all day and night doing nothing besides online chating when they can be doing a essay or something helpful or caring. you know i use to addicted to the computer myself and because of that i almost failed all my classes and because of that i don't use the computer to talk or anything such as that but now i just read my email or write my essay. and that concludes my or should i say your next top story.
0.6 dear @caps or @organization, local paper @caps @caps or @organization edioter of local @caps paper. i'm writing a letter to tell you about the effect of computer on people in a society. i think that computers help society learn and helps people to talks to others around the world. computer help society learn about faraway areas of the world, to learn about the history of an area, and to study animals and habits unable to reach with out travel. computer make @caps easier to learn about area that are hard to research like @person and cliff of the @caps in @location, @caps to learn about history of an area or cities of ancient @caps like @organization in @location of @caps. help study animals species and the habits they could home like the @caps @caps@number or the hasin in @caps or the species call the @caps @caps. computer help society learn about all this. computer also help people talk to other around world like you can hold a confeti on you computer when you are home, @caps is easier to talk and ask questin with others as you are on vacation, and you don't have to pay to travel to a place to have a confess with others. you can hold a confess on your computer from home when you can't make to @caps. @caps's easier to talk and ask question about something important to your business. you can go on your computer and talk with other people without spending money to travel there. this how computer help people talk with others around the world. this how computers help socity learn and talk to other around the world. @caps or @organization edioter of local newspaper.
0.4 dear @caps @caps, i think that computers do not benefit society. they do more bad than good in my opinion. people aren't on the computer to research people. they are on to check @caps, @caps, @caps. they need to get outside and see the outside world, people should interact with family and friends. humans that have to much on time on their hands. so their bored maybe they will make a @caps account or if they already have on then they will maybe one of the games on their and eventually you get addicted to @caps and you never go off of it. our society needs to encourage people to get outside and only use your computer to check your email, add something to your ipod, and maybe check if you have any notification on @caps. if you want to really have a great life sitting in front of the computer your entire life isn't going to let you have that kind of fun. ya need to live your life like your going to die tommorow. get outside, watch the big game with all your buddies. go on a vacation get away with your family. travel the world and rember every part of it. wouldn't you rather be doing that then to be sitting in front of your computer? we need to inform our state about this problem. there is a reason why we are becoming one of the fastest countries! people are not leaving their house and not getting active. if people avoid their computers then we could be one of the fittest countries.
0.7 dear local newspaper, i beleive, myself if, that computers are extreemly important to our society in this day and age. computers help people talk with people. online, and keep in touch with family and friends. secondly, i think that computers are important is because they help with learning, even online schooling. lastly, computers just help for the need of entertainment for people. computers are one of the most used tools on the planet. almost every family has one, some people even have more than @num. let's face it, there are many people traveling around the world, just trying to make a decent living for their families. computers help them keep in touch, wheather it's by e-mailing them, or even video chat. this makes people happy, and still keeps them informed about what their family members, or friends are up to. for some people, it can re-unite family, by someone searching, i don't know, maybey their long-lost brother, or something. computers keep families togetherm and you might just got a little surprise every now and again! my we should keep computers because we. lastly, computers can just be plain fun! maybe you're looking for some funny videos, just go on and search, funny videos , and it will keep you busy for a while. i know that i enjoy downloading music, too, so why should it be any different for other people? if there is a song going through your head, just look it up and i'm sure you'll find what you are looking for. you @month be cooking and need a recipie for something, i am sure you're computer is more than willing to tell you whatever you please. all right, so, computers are one of the most important tools, of this world that we live in today. we depend on computers for many things, like keeping in touch with family, helping people learn things, and provide entertainment, just to name a few. computers can help with countless things.
0.6 dear local newspaper @caps i think that kid's should be alowed to go on here computers. so they can talk to there relitives across. the @caps @caps they want to. i have family members in @location. i talk to them evry day because i have a laptop and they say that. i have relitives in @location i belive them because i have there email. they told me about my mother living in @location. so i asked her she seaid yes that is true and i looked up were my mom lived. thanks to computer also i learned that @location has one of the @caps @caps in the @caps. so i asked my mom @caps i can go to @location she said yes. so i went with my sister and we even visited are family members and the @caps point i can tell you it looked exacly how. i pichered very tall coverd with trees. birds @caps, scwerwels climing trees the thing, that surprised me the most was there was a house on top of the mountine. for sale i wished that my mom was thier because she will love it. so ever time we go down there we rent that house thanks to the computers. lastly you can even look up people on the internet. i herd that criss rock almost died. so when i got home i went on my laptop and looked it up so i did and it said nothing about. that but it did say one thing that surprised me. the most it seaid that he was geting a divorce. from his wife i think the peorson how said. that he almost died most of missed read it. so now i look up all my fraverit people. thanks to computers the time is now to accet @caps people should have computers to use to lern about the @caps or just think what everyone sayes. so i hope you make a good chouse. but befor you choose think about it.
0.4 computers are very helpful in many of ways. i believe that computers can a very great needed affect on you. @caps can cause you to @caps, @caps and cheap @caps. the computer can @caps you in many interesting ways. the fast wat @caps can @caps is @caps helping other plan @caps vacations by money to them. also @caps can @caps by know how to do diffrent things like @caps if you get lost or show you how to get there. the second way is helps is to give @caps. the computer can give you plenty of @caps. i use the computer @caps @caps @caps of . @caps also gives me @caps about a @caps college that i would @caps and like to attend to. the last way the computer helps out the its with box from there. if you @caps@number online you can in the computer. i @caps this machine because you don't have to buy something that just come out @caps the real expensive @caps you can just @caps@number online and @caps @caps @caps a cheaper @caps. also @caps mom wanter to @caps new @caps on the dealer but @caps was expensive so went online and bought @caps cheaper than the would sell @caps to us. this is how the computer can come in handy when you need @caps. this is why i believe that computer you.
0.6 my opinion is that the more that we stay on the computer. the more we get lazy. one reason that i say this is because, a computer is a big handy person in reality. second reason is, people stay in the house sitting down on the computer other than exercising. the third reason is, people just sit in the house, and an't enjoy fresh air with their loved ones. first, the reason why i say a computer is a big handy person because it does most of the things a human can do. that can lead a person to being very lazy. just too sit in the house and go to websites. it has a big effect on a humans life. the computer technology have contecll over a huge population of recae. it really make miss out on half of their day. second, people stay in the house on the computer other than exercising. it's very unhealthy for a person to sit down at a computer all day. the person has to eat so, basicly they eat and sit back down at the computer. it can get out hand because the computer allows people to grace food online. so that right there is an example of people not getting ecersise, and being lazy. you need to get your ecersise dayly. so people that doesnt get their ecersise need to start. instead of sitting down on the computer all day. third, many people over whole world have a lot of love one's that they care about and love.  but  they dnt get time to be with them, because they are always on the computer. the computer shouldn't take you away from you outdoor life. okay, so what you can talk fo your friend and family over the computer. it's never like seeing them in person. go outside and have fun and happy memories with your family. because the computer is just words being texted. it's nothing like being said. i garrented you that. if you spend time with youre family then you will want to do it again. while your going out excersise and be interacting. in conclusion, if you are allways on the compute that's not good. just take a few hours out of the day and ecersise. go out and have a marvelous day. because the computer doesn't do nothing but make you lazirer (@caps you). if your allways on the computer just be sure that you get your ecersise and your time with your family. it will make your a better person!
0.6 dear @person editor, i think that the computers have both positive and negative effects, but more positive. for example, when people get home from work or school, they immedlatly go on the computer, to check email, do work, or to play games. i think that it's good to connect with friends and learn about the far away nature and people that we cant see, but too much of it will be bad. i know it will be bad because it can cause a lack of exercise and the computer can cut you off from your family and friends if you're on it too much, i think it's good to go on the computer for a limited amount of time each day, but also spend time outside with family and friends. the computer is good because of all the extrodinary things it offers and the things you can learn. i myself like to play video games on it like bubble spinner but at the same time i'll be on facebook, facebook lets me connect with friends and family while bubble spinner helps with hand-eye coordination, when projects came along i usually do all my research there, picking up information on each site. i also do all the writing on it too so it wont look messy but instead, clean and neat. the computer also offers video of pretty much anything on t.v. and otherwise, like youtube or google videos. the computer lets me see nature, talk to friends and family, and lets me see things, like videos, that twill never ever see in books. these show that the computer has a bigger positive impact than negative and we should take advantage of the new technology that we have and not let it go to waste. the computer is a nice outlit to come home and let yourself unwind to. people say that you don't get enough exercise but we have gym and recess at school and we become exhausted at work, which is enough exercise for the day. computers are a nice device to have and are by far, used daily by almost everyone. so it can't be all that bad by depriving you from nature and family because it lets you see it anyway. the effects it has on people are good because of the knowledge and communication it brings. i hope you see my point of view.
0.6 dear local newspaper, i am writing a letter to you to explain why i think computers are not good to have. my three supporting reasons are that if you are on the computer all the time there's a chance that you might gain weight and becom obese. you would rather be on the computer than to hang out with your family, and lastly you won't have any friends to talk to. please read on to hear my story. first of all if your always on the computer your not going to get up and go outside for a little because it won't be important to you. also your going to have to eat and when you get exited your going to want to eat more. then you'll start getting overweight because you don't want to exercise. secondly, you would spend less time with your family. you would think that your going to hang out with them later. so then you play more and get addicted. so then you and your family would grow apart. and you would be lonely because you gave up your family just so you can play a game on the computer. for my last reason on this matter is that you wont have friends. i think you won't have friends because if your on the computer all the time you wont even bother to go to the park to play or go to the gym, to try to get into sports then you won't meet anyone. the only friends that you would most likely have is friends on the computer. that you will never meet in real life and won't socialize to the about there life and to hang out with. in conclusion i think it is not a good idea to have a computer because you can become obese, you will spent less time with your family, and you won't have any friends to talk to. i hope you enjoyed this letter and take it into consideration.
0.7 i think using the computer is great. you should heed my advice, people should be useing computers. computers are an exelent way to comunicate. people can connect with others from all over the world. my dad moved to brazil so we have ben communicating via, @caps-mail, @caps, and even facebook. it s the easyest and cheapest way to comunicate. if i call someone from a different country it would cost me way more but if i send them an @caps-mail it s cheaper. studys from the university of @location show that @percent people think its easyer and to use a computer to comunicate. more over you can do it instantly so it gets the information anywhere in milliseconds. computers are indeed the best way to comunicate. another thing computers are used i for as learning. many people from around the world have learned diffrent languages from wed sites or programs that have great instruction and lessons. i learned to play guitar with maney programs and online lessons. maney people depend on computers to get information and learn about things. my mom is a secretary at an inseurens broker companey. without computers the coustemers couldn t learn about the diffren policeys that there are and they misth be spending more money then needed on insearence. with out computer scientests couldn t do much reasarch or learn about plants or rocks. computers make it easyer for them to study and learn about @location and everything. doctors wouldn t be adel to do half of the thing they can with out a computer. they learn about diffrent sicknesses and broken bones by useing computers. @person said she couldn t be able to help out as many people with out the use and help of a computer she states that she learned @percent of what she knows from websites that have in formation about the humin body. even teachers say that they set better teaching skills from web sites. builder and modern desiner @person says he learned about different building designes that are sturdyer and stronge shapse he used this in his building today. i hope that you can how see how great computer are and how much they help our present day citizens.
0.7 @organization, in @date, more and more of the newest technology is being brought out to the public. computers, @caps-bars, telephones, and more are getting the most hi-tech softwares and machinery to @caps some of the most meraculous things happen. there is a cell-phone that allows you to turn of you lights in your house from thousands of miles today. this technology can be the best thing that has ever happend to the world. some might argue that though. but i am here to argue the @caps-sayers. with the new computers, people are able to talk with people all over the world. also dreams can some true for people that never have the chance to follow @caps. also, questions that have been asked can now be answered. i have a number of cousins in @location who i only talk to if i go to visit @caps which is very rare. because of some of the programs like @caps, or @caps @caps, i am able to converse with @caps cousins. some people say that the @organization can @caps kids like me want to miss out on some quality-time with @caps family. well, @caps brother is going to @caps@number in six months and i am going to want to talk with him. with phone companies haunting their costumers with scary prices, @caps family is not going to want to sit on the phone with him for @num hours and have to cut into their savings. on @caps @organization, there is an application called i-chat which allows me to talk with @caps brother and see him as if he were home with me. @caps dad found out about @caps and he decided to try it out. as of now, he has reconnected with tons of his high-school friends @caps get back in the game. maybe you can find a special friend that you almost forgot about. or you can find out what is happening with your sister who lives in @location. the @organization also allows those less fortunate who can never afford a plane ride to discover a place they've always wanted to go. the internet offers virtual tours of places like the @location of even @location- @caps places can be explored without stepping foot out of your house. also @caps, a website that offers millions of videos, incudes tourtorials for dances, sports, tricks, and more @caps you don't have to break into the bank for charged lessons. another good thing about the @organization is it offers mostly reliable information. sorry didn't get to finish @num paragraph & conlusion.
0.7 computers effect a lot of people. i fully support the advances in technology. i support this because computers can let you talk to people that are faraway from you. computers also teach hand-eye coordination. in addition, computers let you learn about countrys all over the word. rapping it all up, electronics should keep advancing. say your bestfriend moved to @location. you won't see her but you can talk to her on the computer. now in day there are a lot of websites that you can chat off at or you can also do a webcam chat like ovoo. for example, in seventh grade i moved from @location to @location. i was so upset about leaving my old friends. turns out i was fine. i just made more friends when i moved. i would make plans with my friends over facebook chating. consequently, computers help a lot you keep in touch with friends all over the world. computers build up your skills for everything. hand-eye coordination is the biggest skill that computers teach anyone. when your watching an adult type most of them can type without looking at the keyboard. this is an example of hand-eye coordination. hand-eye coordination is very helpful in sports. in basketball you should dribble and look ahead. kinda like typing. as one can see computers help with hand-eye coordination. google gives you answers to anything. if you have research to do most people use google and google is found on the computer. you can learn about @location or @location you name it you can type it in google, and you can learn everything about that country. for example, last year everyone had to pick a state and learn certain things about it. most people used computers. computers really are the best electronic in the world. there are many electronics that effect people. but, computers effect people the most. computers let you talk to family and friends around the world. also, computer teach you hand-eye coordination skills. lastly, computer teach you about many countrys. in conclusion, computers should be advanced.
0.7 dear @organization, the age of the computer is upon us. every where you go, you will see people with laptops or other portable computer devices. while some people dislike the world's large usage of the computer, i happen to disagree, i feel that the computer is a great @caps to put out and find information. i also feel that it is good @caps for people to communicate with ther family and friends who live far away. lastly, i think that computers provide us with fun activities, entertainment, and a @caps to relax. what do you do when you want to know what the capital of @location is? you either go break out the old atlas, or, with a simple click of a button on the computer, discover that the capital is @location. my point is that with computers, finding information is fast and easy. also, with computers you can share information as well as receive it. lets say that you are not a doctor but have discovered a cure for the common cold by using iteams find in everyone's households. what do you do? well, you could go to the media and do interview after confrence after interview, or, you could simply post it on the @caps. it is plain to see that the computer in an important not in the process of exchanging information.  i'm sorry @person, but we can't fly out to @location to see @caps @person. we don't have enough money.  i think that everyone has heard a variation of that line at least once. but here comes the computer to the rescue! with computers @caps @person over in @location level is just a click (and or screen) away. by using webcams, you can speak with someone across the world without having to worry about the expensive costs of flights! no webcam? no problem! you can send someone very far away a message through e-mail or instant messaging. say  bye  to expensive phre rides, long phone bills, or years going by seeing a loved one. computers are,not just tools that are used strictly for, computers can be used for purposes as weel. in other words, computers can be used for fun! how exactly does the make computers have a creative on society? i'll tell you how. many @caps are workaholics, also known as people who warr @caps to much. after a long day of signing papers and fiddling with a budget, wouldn't it be nice to just sit down and play some solitare? thats possible with a computer, and you don't even need a deck of cards! computers are full of fun games, like solitare and chess. these games are a great @caps to help people relax, and trust me, everyone needs relaxation. having some downtime can really help someone to be a healthier and happier person! aren't computers great? they can let us to exchange information talk to family and friendss across the globe(without a big pore tag), and they provide us with entertainment. so everyone out there could does not like the effect of the computers have on the public, please reconsider. computers really are a helpful, fun, and useful tool to society.
0.6 dear @caps i think more and more people use computers because it can help you find a job if you lost it. because right now some job are going bank ruded. and parants can not help because they didn't have job to support there love ones. another thing is that cars are going up on prices so if you don't have a lot of money you can go online and get a car and truck for great prices. and it can help you save a lot of money in your pocet. for some reason @num out of @num people like to go to far away places for example @caps, put or @location, @caps. and you if go to these place then you would need place to stay and have a good meal with your family or friends. so you would need a nice pleasant holetitle which will have awsome food, beds, pools and more thing people like to do when they is on vaction. and for example if your mother or father what you to go to your public school but you don't what too because you heared something or about the school say because you cant find great school online for example @caps, cap pre, classicle, brizzal, and some other school are the best to and fun to go to and be succesful with your life. now you know why more and more people use computers and you should always use technology and it would help you on the hand eye giving people the ability to learn about use computers.
0.7 i am so happy, i just finished my school report on @person and i didn't even need to leave my house. i was able to talk with my classmate and ask her questions online. i also managed to get all the information just from my computer. i also learned how to row a boat, to show my class how @location crossed the @caps river, i learned that by taking on online course. this is one situation why computers have fantastic effects on people in everyday situations. local research show that @percent of @caps planning their vocation use the internet. the reason these citizens use internet is to get the information about the hotel and vacation cite. that is one way that makes computers helpful and positive devices, beacuse it makes it easier for busy @caps to get ready for a trip by looking at pictures of the hotel online and getting all the info they need. doctor @person of @caps university says  computers now offer programs that allow busy @caps to learn a new skill, @percent of @caps currently use this software.  @caps everyday @caps don't have time to go out a join a group or class to learn new skills. that is why computers are so helpful and people just love them. instead of leaving home they can be cooking, doing yoga, or speaking a new language all from their computer at home. that is another reason why computers are useful in vey positive ways. imagine forgetting your homework at school and not be able to an a in that class. well because of computers forgetful students can talk to a classmate online and get the homework and do it. or they could even use the internet to go to that school website and find the homework and print it out. many students around the country forget homework once in a while, because of helpful computers they can fix their problems easily. let's recap, students or adults can get information off the internet for projects or even vacations. busy @caps who don't have time to leave their house can take a class or learn a new skill right on the computer. anyone can use the internet to talk or chat online to get school work or to long distance friends. that is why the effects on computers to people are nothing but positive. now what can you do? it is important that computers stay in our lives, they are helpful and we have learned to live with them, which is why they must stay. this benefits you because newspaper houses are organized by computers and it keeps you business running.
0.6 many people in society think computers are bad, i think computers are exellent. computers allow you to comunicate with your friends, family and relatives. with a computer you can do home work extra fast, no having to go to the library to look stuff up. computers also allow you to take out anger on ones and zeros. muny experts like @organization think people will talk to stranger on website like facebook and myspace. if parent place him son the websites and also make it so only freinds can you profile you will be alot safer. comunications engineer @person says that it is better for people to talk from it online than not i know he is correct because i have relatile in the @location that i love talking to but they are @num miles away so communication is or i to get, then i got a facebook and it is like they are next door. @caps. @organization @person says that @percent of strangers that are molestores/ thugs go, after, people who don't protect their profile so protect your profile and be safe. computers are better than going to the libra! this is there because going to the library means you have to round up the kids get in the cor and go. with a computer you can just go into your office and do re search, that saves money or gas. if you have a prodject of you can just send it straight to they teacher. in many today experts like @caps. @organization a conducting experiment that are rigged. violence they say is cursed by the games but they use test subjects like an the bad people you dont want to meet. i have found video games to be a great let out for stress biut up during the day. muny of my friends have also found this. video games make you think that is also reason they are good. in conclusion computers are exelent. they make it so ther is the ability to communicate with friends alow you to take out anger. what is not to love? get a computer now!!
0.6 i walked outside to get the mail and newspaper. i saw the front page talking about computer. an article said, too much computer using. i though there wasn't going to sell more computer but, it said that people are using computers and are not exercising much. i think that people are not going to have a hard time quitting to use their computer. i had a friend that didn't know how to use the computer. he past his hour playing outside. in the @date he tries out for @caps baseball. he is a very good athlete. he does grate in school too. others people without a gob are not looking for something 'to do they are at the computer everyday. when they should be doing work around and inside the house. peoples with computers shouldn't be all day like these friend my friend haves is using his computer everytime he comes from school. he don't do his homework on time. every time he doesn't want to go out and exercise his mind or get a little bit of sun he sometimes don't eat so he should give his brain a rest and do physical things that will help them. other person such as the computer workers should write a note to people with computer saying how computer can be addicted to people and maybe realize how much often they should use their computer and was using it to go to get information and to collage. she started to use the computer to chat with people and ended up using the computer a lot and not going to collage. i believe that computers are an major impact on people. people should be going about to have fun get sunlight not staying at the computer all the time. many adults don't use the computer is most the teens and kids. people should go to the gym and build strong muscles. they should stay away from computer for a time. agains computer would be the right thing to do.
0.5 dear the daily newspaper crew, i have seen some of your own disagree about using computers. i for one believe that using a comenter really isn't that bad. for example, the computer is actually good for education. many use them to create @num images of things for schoolprojects or science fair projects. i use these machines to play video games on to cure my boredum like most young teens and children do. unlike most people i dont stay on it forever. i usually play for a couple hours. there are some downsides to having computer in the house. for one the machines use up load of energy in the house making the electric bill rise and @date. on some websites there are people who try to be a stalker like the website my space and twitter but on the bright side these who try to be a stalker usually instantly get caught and put in jail. computers actually have a positive effect on the mind and movements. for example children who have computers learn how to fly a kite or for themselves with their parents watching and they learn hand-eye. many children who play sports that have computers actually manage to catch a ball faster than usual. so you see computers are not that bad. so please think of what will happen to children if computers are banned.
0.6 dear @caps newspaper i'm writing a letter to you about how i feel about the effects that computers have on people. one of my reasons is that people that spend to much time on the computers they are litting their lifes pass by them. but the people that work on computers all day is a different thing. my second reason is that people could be on the computers and still interact with their family because they live with each other. my last reason is why do people want to be on computers all day. i'm not talking about the people that work on computer. my last reason is that the people that is spending all their time on the computer they are letting their lifes pass by there. the reason i say this is because if you are on the computer @num your life is passing by you. because you are not doing nothing, just sitting in a chair in the computer getting fat. also if you are going to be on the computer at least they to find a job on the computer. but i'm not talking about the people that work in computer all day long, because they have to do it. its their job to. thats one of my reasons. my second reason is that the people this me in the computer they still interact with their family. the reasons i say this is because you could be on the computer and will interact with my family because you live it the same huge as them, two when you are not in the computer you could be with your family and spend time with them. that's why i said that you still could interact with your family even you see on the computer. the last and final reason is do people to spend most of their lifes on the computer. the person i like this because type of person would spend most of their life on the computer and don't go find a job go enjoy their life. also if you got kids you have fun with your children and make them believe that they parents that was to them, that, they had fun with them, and that they had somebody that they could look up too. so don't spend your life time on the computer geting fat, not spending time with their children and make something yourselfs. but i'm not talking about the people that workon computers. i'm talking about the people that don't work on computers. thats why i said don't let youre life pass by you. i hope you liked the prompt and that you wont spend a lot of your life in the computer doing nothing just getting fat and letting your life pass you. i'll report myself again i'm not talking about the people that have to work in the computer. i'm talking about the people that don't work in computers.
0.0 what compters stop you from doing is your homework in school. but when you do something on the computer your not soposes to do, you get stuck on a website you can't get off your screen. so what i'm trying to say is to don't stay on the computer than just @num min.
0.6 dear readers, @caps you imagine not talking to distant friends, only knowing about your town, or even failing @caps you didn t ha a @caps? i know i couldn t. some of the great benefits of having a @caps are talking online with friends, learning about new places and things everywhere, and being able study for and tests from the internet. first, being able to talk to distant friends and relatives is now passive with the @caps. facts show show that @percent of families in the @location have distant friends with @caps, now all of these people can tlk to each other! ill never forget the time that my close freinds moved, but i was still able to talk to him @caps of the @caps. second, the @caps allows you to learn about new places and things all around the world. i never would have i know about some of the places i've been to if it was for comoputer, @organization stated that the @caps expert @person says  @caps are the reason we have in much without @caps wouldn't know about the places.  @caps, it is now possible study without @caps of the @caps, @caps can be done on the internet online. i'll never forget the that i forget my book, but i @caps still study @caps of the online book. in conclusion the @caps has benifits to you, like interacting with friends online, learning about new places, and being able to study. computers are just end all-around benifits.
0.6 dear @caps, i think computers aren't good for people because they could spend that time exercising, hanging out with friends and family and reading. the first reason i don't think computers are good for people is because they could spend that time exercising instead of @caps'ing you could ride your bike or even walk the dog, exercising @month be hard work but, it's better then staring at your computer screen. just because you eat well dosen't mean your healthy. you need exercise to stay healthy too. so, run, ing, walk the dog, go to a gym instead of sitting at the computer. another reason i think computers aren't good for you is because in the time your on the computer you could be hanging out with your friends and family. lets say your family is going to the beach, you stay home to play games on facebook. your family comes back talks about all the fun they had, even tho you weren't there. you could have been apart of those memories. now time to compare with your friends. its movie night, all your friends are going. but, you stay home to webcam with your aunt. you stayed home both times just to be on the computer. you missed out on a lot. my final reason i think computers are bad is because, instead of computer time it should be reading time. looking at a computer screen and reading is a lot different then reading a book. reading books increases your vocabulary, you learn about different types of litature. over all reading books makes you smarter. when your reading online you just read what people say, basically rumors. read! in conclusion i think people should spend more time exercising, hanging out with family and friends and reading instead of being on computers.
0.8 many families across the globe use computers, whether their from @location, all the way to the deserts of @location. however, believe that being on a computer can negative effects to you like lack of exercise, in @caps perspective. i can agree, with there, but i truly believe that computers can have a positive effect on society if used correctly. with computer on @caps side, i believe there are many positive effects towards computers, such as: there are many things to do, you can from the internet, and it is very entertaining. if you have a computer, i'm sure you can agree with me that there are tons of good things you can do. for example, i know of many online colleges. ever heard of the commecial,  @caps in your @caps's?  that is where students can got their @caps.e.d and have a succesful carreer. not only that, you can get discounts on many items just by shopping online. there are many shopping sites online, such as @organization. furthermore, many shops like @caps @caps have a catolog online, where you and effenly. lastly, if you have close relatives or friends that live far away, there are many options today like @caps, (@caps @caps @caps). webcam programs like which you see and talk to each other using a webcam and @caps@number where you can find your friends and check how their doing daily. these are all good reasons why computers are sucess in the economy. some computers are used for entertainment. online there are many @caps you can play, like @caps's (@caps @caps online @caps-@caps @caps) i play many of these, including @caps such as @caps. i love these @caps because they are very amusing world. you watch many of your favorite movies watch funny obeses on the internet via @caps. @caps is a world-wide used source where you can watch or upload videos so the world can see. a @caps video is  @caps @caps@number @caps @caps,  a young boy gets bitten by his younger brother. this entertainment system is also a great way to use up time lik if you're bored. i can see how people be to it, but you just need to use it wisely and make a plan to use the computer maybe an hour a day. a computer also has many great sources you can learn from, like an online website that has fun @caps called @caps. with this, you can play many fun @caps while learning about interesting facts about science. in @caps science class, we use this websites many times, to us learn about motion/gravity. you can also conduct research on the web, you with many projects. i know i use the web to with almost every project i have.
0.7 dear local newspaper writer, i'm writting to talk to you about the use of computers. i think computers benifit our comunties a lot. i feel this way because it can warn us about a natural disaster. it teaches us about everything & everything. last we get to talk to people online in these next paragraphs ill share my thoughts about this topic to you. my first reason is natural disasters. computers always warn us about them. for example when hurricane katrina hit computers were able to see that on their. many people was able to flee the city before that happened. states shows @percent of the natural disasters computer classified them. computers saves people live eaach & every. another example is with the earthquakes that recently happened in @location. computers informed many people about them. those were my reasons how computers warn us about natural disasters. my second reason why i say computers benifit us is because it teaches us about everything & anything we learn about faraway places, new word & things that is happening in our own country. for example i had to research a person my project & all i dis was type in his name & pages full of information popped. you will be amazal how much information the computer has. comuter has everything you need on as person & so much more. this is my second reason why computers are helpful. my last reason we get to talk online. now the has its pros & cons. talking online is very fun. i mean you in many website, myspace, facebook, twitter. its never ending. people can talk to old friends, family anybody really. but many people have to be careful cause their creeps out ther. like say you can't meet up with you friend you can @organization or oovoo (webcame) them. the computer is you friend. so you might as well make good use with it. this is my last reason now the computer can benifit you. in conclusion i think the computer makes the world that much easier. my reason why you ask. it warns us about, natural disaster. it teaches us everything & anything. last up can talk online.
0.9 dear @person  @caps, @caps  i'm sure you all have heard the sound of a mouse or people typing if you have walk into an office, our local library, a doctor's office, or even our districts schools. the reality is that computers and the world-wide-web is seem and used everywhere. without a computer, how would @caps be able to access our emails, interact with family memmber across the ocean and finish that research paper out teacher has assigned us? in my opinion, computers hace a phenomenal affect on people and their lives. the computer helps develope hand-eye coordination, learn about specifil subjects and interact with people on the computer. therefore, with such positive affects, @caps should keep using this wonderful technology and get our jobs done. have you ever walked into your schools lab or walked into a office building and all you could hear was the clicking of mouses or the buttons being pressed down on the keyboard? well, not only is a job being completed, but you are also exercising i remember last month when my class was assigned a five page essay. after the second page, my hands hurt very badly, @caps, not only was i completing my essay, i was also exercising my hands. not only does computers allow you to exercise, it also helps develops hand-eye coordination. have you ever played a game where you had to cath fist, or playes a fast-pasle game of pinball? well, those games require one key thing i hand-eye coordination. computers are very helpful in todays world. the computer and the world-wide-web is useful in several other ways too. the internet also allows you to learn about certain subject or events you might not have a book for. my bestfriend, @person, called me one day from the train. on the phone, she was frantic because she was giving a speech and she did not know what the statistic was for type @caps diabetes. what do you do when you have no book for a specific subject? @person went on her laptop and found all the information she she dit not know. this is just another way the quick acces to a computer benefits people.  you've got mail  i'm sure you have all heard this before. besides communicating through letters or on the telephone, the internet has also given us more ways for fast communication. when you need to confirm a meeting place or ask your classmate what problems were assigned homework, what could be a fast mean of communication? sending a instant message, or e-mail are two ways of course. not only does computers allow you to communicate quickly but also privately. both your e-mail account and you instant message account have passwords so that only you can access them. every four out of five households have a computer avalable for completing assignments, checking, e-mails and learning about the, that happend in @location last week. the computer has put a positive affect on numerous people and their everyday need. in my opinion, the computer has been one of the best technologies in history. this amazing technology has helped students, teachers, doctors, police officers and even you bank aggents serve our community and make it a better one. thank-you.
0.6 i think computers are very benefical. there are so many uses! from learning, to games, to videos, and to a tool that is very useful. without computers we would be like the @caps (@caps offense any @caps people). we would have to wait for a news paper or the news to come on @caps.v. to see becalling news. let me explain my reasoning in the next few paragraphs. first and foremost, there are lots of things to do. you can play online games, off-line games, surf the web, chat, match videos, and so on and so forth. without the internet i probably would have lost my interest in @organization. i now am a member of the online community called www.mocpages.com i post my creations, look at others creations, and comment, and chat. i use the internet to reasearch for school projects. right now, i am reasearching @caps @caps during the @caps @caps. normally i would have to slave over books to find something. now it is much easier, because keywords are matched. finally, it is a good fool. did you know the millitary needs computers to store info, attack, keep record, and to pilot certain planes? i need to use a computer to type up home work, because as you can see, my hand writing isn'@caps the neatest. also, i stay in touch with my dad, who works in @organization. i hope i persuaded you on my position. remember computers, do lots of things, help us learn, and they are a fantastic tool. thanks for reading, bye!
0.6 dear @caps, i believe that computers have a positieve effect on people. they do because you can talk to others online, it allows you to get research done faster and they are much more efficent and easy to use i will further explain my reasons. first of all, computers allow you to talk to others online. talking to others online can give you good communication skills and you can get to know different people. i always talk to my friends online. we talk to each other using webcams, instany messaging, or talking on a social site like facebook. computers and webcams can allow you to talk to friends who have moved away or for relatives. next, computers allow you to get research done quicker. studies shown that @percent of people prefer using a computer to find information for any type of paper than an enclyepdia or other book. computers are much more efficent and easier to use than books. it can agree that computers are much more efficent and that i like to use them. if you use a computer to get research done than you can be done sooner than you know it. finally, computers are more efficent and easy to use. if you give a person to coose from a computer or a set of encyelpedias, most people would choose the computer. computers are so much easier to use than books. on the comuter you just type in what you are looking for in search bar a boom within a tenth of a second your results are there. now, if you use a book or enclyelpedia it could take several minutes to find what you are looking for, and then they only give very little information, unlike a computer that can give you millions of results for one topic. this proves that computer are more efficent than books. in conclusion, i believe that computer have a posieve effect on people. i do because you can talk to people online, it allows you to get research done quicker, and computers are more efficent and easy to use. i hope you will agree with me and my thoughts about computers.
0.6 dear newspapers, i think that computers have a possitive effect on people because you could chat online. there are electronics out for children that they can plug up to there computer and learn different stuff. and you can pay your bills on the computer. people that have no phone od don't want to leave the house at that moment and have a computer can go on chat rooms or a local website can chat to friends and family. also many people that have websites like facebook, myspace etc... can find new people and have so many things in common. and some people do find that @caps person that they been looking for. i think that they jusy come out with a new electronic for little kids like leaf frog that they can plug up to a computer/laptop and they can learn there alaphabet, counting numbers, and even spelling, this is a good product for little kids so they cam use the extra work over, the @date or after school so they can stay smart and learn in school and out of school. one day i had my mother what she was doing and the light bill so i was like how can you and she said and a website bt i forgot what's it called and you could pay your bills right there. so instead of up going in your are go to a local show when thay pay bills and can like or if you get a computer you can do that in you home with no . so people who publish the newspaper i think and i hope you think to this is a good response that tells you good things about a computer. and i hope it sticks around for a long time.
0.7 dear newspaper, @caps a family. just a normal family whose lives have been changed due to computers. they are overweight, constantly suffering from fatigue, lonely, nature deprived and lazy. however, they could of turned out differently if they just shut down their computers. they might of healthy. fit, energetic, radiant, hardworking people if they had stopped spending hours on the computer daily. although there are some positive computers can be dramatic. they isolate you from friends and family, they deprive you of the nature around you, and most of all, they @month cause you to become overweight or even obease. friends and family are two very important things in everybody's life, even if you dont realize it. by using computers rather than interacting with them, you are the connections you have. computers @month cause you to isolate yourself. they might cause you to talk to your . unfortunatley, friendships can be .  spending long hours on my computer had caused me to become . made me fell lonely, @person, @num, says @caps, by the use of computers you are doing yourself a favor. computer can deprive you of the nature that surrounds you. you most likely would be on you ocmputer rather than going outside. instead of spending countless hours on the computer, you could be playing a sport or activity. by playing sports you are increasing you hand eye coordination, far more then if you were to be on a computer. wouldnt you like to be having funs with your friends playing vollyball, basketball, swimming or even going rather then sitting infront of your computer? i know i would! the obesity rates of this country will increse if people continue to use computers. you will rize about @percent from lack of exersize. computers can ruin lives by increasing your chance of becoming unhealithy overweight. so now think, would you want to be lonely, overweight, and deprived of nature? i know i definiely wouldn't. why computers should be used less frequently! so hows the time; lets join together and raise awareness of the negitive effects of computer!
0.7 currently, there has been a debate on whether or not computers benefit society. some people, say that computers enable internet conversations between friends, and computers pass off information about faraway places and people. however, i tend to believe that the computer is not necessary. people exploit most of their time on comptuers, reducing their exercise time. not many pay attention to nature, and instead of talking to friends in the internet, why not meet them at the park? many people who use their computers reducing their metabolism. this is one reason why the @location.a has the highest obesity rates in the world. in addition, the less you exercise, the less healthy you will be, and the more pair you'll recieve, you will feel more tense if your muscles are not exercise. if we, as @caps, continue to lack exercise, there won't be many possibilities for us in the future. isn't it difficult to know that people pay too much attention to the computer when there are endangered species in nature? pandas! polar bears, whales of different types, and other creatures all need our help to fight this extinction problem. unfortunately, we pay much of our attention on the computer, with consideration, as humans, we make things possible, so we should help creatures in need to survive for generations. perhaps we @month learn more about these creatures if we take time off of the computer to do so. perhaps we will find nature more interesting. why do we have text messaging in our computers if we have the ability to talk to our frinds in a park? we have the freedom of speech in the @location. our families need help occasionally, but sometime we're not available. while reducing our social life, our computer hours are becoming more important, and are distracting what's mos important. in conclusion, computers hours, you must think about what can be done for nature, for your health, and for your family and friends.
1.0 in a study conducted by @organization, @num out of @num people are spending more that @num hours a day on the computer.  @caps computers became so popular here has been an increase in social problems, health issues and pollution,  says @person. the question is then, do computers really benefit society or do they have a negative affect on people? i strongly believe that these computers are badly affecting us. first, less people are spending time outside enjoying nature. imagine, sitting outside under the brilliant fall sun as leaves of red, yellow, and green dance with the wind. how will anyone see the beautiful sights of the outside world if their eyes are glued to the computer screen? eight out of ten @caps surveyed by the national nature @caps admit to not going outside on sunny days but instead play on the computer.  the more people who see how beautiful is the less likely they will pollute it with smoke. dr @person. how is our country supposed to be clean if people want even turn off the computer the @num hour a day and see the world? in conclusion, computers have a negative affect on person because they seeing beauty. second, computers take up so much time that people are with their families. i used to think that talking with someone. now, i've realized that talking in real life with people is better. i remember meeting the girl. she woulod always talk with email texting of instant messaging. seventy-nine percent of families split up due to social problems. all smart, intelligent people talks about families or just car and around, these sucessful people know the key to happiness is communication and are working to help get rid of computers. lastly, more time on computers means less exercise. teenagers are supposed to get one hour of exercise each day but @num out @num teens surveyed at @organization admit getting that exercise. there has been a @percent increase in a obesity in children from @date when computers weren't big. now almost @num/@number of boys in @num grade at @organization agree to spending too much time on computers. in conclusion computers take away some important things line exercise. come on now-can't we agree that computers have a negative offers ? our poor environment is getting killed because no one sees the beauty of families are seeing occupy their lives most a lot up and sight against computers today! it will be the best choice you ever make.
1.0 dear @organization, @caps has come to @caps attention that certain members of our society believe that computers are not beneficial. this position comes from lack judgement and a closed mind. computers are lifelines to buisness workers who use them to complete all of their work, these tools also enable news of disaster or weather to spread efficiently and effectively. these technological devices also create and sustain communication between family members and friends. in todays society computers are vital and getting rid of them would be like stopping oxygen from making its way to the body, being accompanied by multiple severe consequences. first and foremost, about @percent of all modern companies require their employees to work on computers. these works of art aren't just handy-dandy toys , rather @caps essential to the working class @caps a   @num pencil to a student taking a cut. @person, an owner of a small buisness, agrees.  @caps company designs software and uses computers @num. many of @caps employees work from home and have to own computers.  the growth of computers is not something to be frowned upon, rather an achievement in technology enhancing the lives of others. by ripping our computers from lives of workers chaos would be created with many unappealing consequences. adults aren't the only ones whose jobs consists of computers. nowadays students' homework is mostly online, computers decrease the amout of time needed to write an essay and are glare to students of all ages, @person, an eighth grades at @organization, is an example of this dilema. every night she has at least three hours of homework and usually one hour be @caps requires a computer, however, this isn't a problem because @caps cuts back the time @caps takes for @person to do her homework. she can quickly type up an @caps essay or research a science topic instead of doing @caps painstakingly slow using an old fashion method. moreover, computers are doors into the real world, especially for residents of @location. whether some people like to believe @caps or not, @location is a bit of a sicludded area where people aren't aware of what is going on outside of their closed off town. computers cause news to spread like electricity and open @location residents eyes to national and global problems @person, another student at @organization, states,   @caps the earthquake took place in @location @caps friends and i were all at lunch, @caps we came back to class @caps teacher was projecting the news via her computer onto the white board  @caps computers were taken away a stream of knowledge would be cut off from adults and children. most importantly, computers create communication between friends and family calling up to talk to someone isn't always an option, so computers are the better choice. families can connect with each other no matter @caps they have cell phone reception or what area of the world they are in, @person is a senior at @location @caps @organization who agrees.  @caps i go to college next year i am going all the way to @location and want to be able to talk to @caps family, via email and instant message i can contact them even @caps its inconvenient because they don't have to respond right away.  @person brings up a good point computers serve the luxury of communication, which is vital to keep @percent of healthy relationships, @caps shows a study at @organization. in conclusion, computers are an incredible piece of equipment that should be valued and not taken away. the are vital to workers and students and bring news to residents of any corner of the world. computers also are how friends and family are able to stay connected and communicate. therefore, i urge you, readers of the @organization, to raise your voice about the benefits of computers, so they aren't taken away from our society.
0.5 more and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. i feel that those people that think computers do not benefit society, are right. i feel this way because people need to start exercising it more, and interact with family and friends. also, should enjoy life. please read on to read in detail, as to why i feel this way. firstly, those who are always on the computer need to exercise more, they need to exercise to stay healthy and strong. if they don't, they will most likely eat more and gain a lot of unwanted fat. also, some of them don't even exercise at all. secondly, they don't interact with their family and friends as much. those people tend to probably argue with their family because they had to get off of computer. when you fight with people you want to gey away from it so you go back to the computer. it's not healthy to be on the computer for long periods at a time. lastly, they should enjoy life. see the world through their own eyes. party with friends and family. go to college and do something with their lives. they need to enjoy things how they originally were without any computers, ipods, or even cellphones. in conclusion, the reasons i feel this why are because people need to exercise more, and interact with family and friends. also, they need to enjoy life. i hope you understand as to why i feel this way.
0.7 to @caps @caps @month concern: @caps i have been informed that you had the idea that more and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits the society. i strongly disagree, i think that computers have a positive effect on people. having computers teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about @caps and faraway places and even allow people to talk online with friends or family. don't you want your children to grow up with great hand-eye coordinatio? more than @percent parents voted yes. as shown in many statistics, adults and children that use the computer for an hour or more a day have better hand-eye coordination than a normal adult or child that only uses @caps once a week. by using the computer for more than one hour a day your typing becomes quicker and your reactions increase. not only does typing quicker effect your computer techniques but @caps also helps you outside of your home like in sports. for exsample, if you play the sport baseball, the speed of your pitch will increase over @percent if you use the computer for over a hour a day! if your a batter your racation to the pitch will also increase by over @percent! just by using computer. is time running out for your @caps project to be do? without computers, you wouldn't get the information you need quick enough. dr. @dr from @organization state  you can get the same information on people other countries, and @caps from the computer as you can . by using the computer you get the as a book and easy. in addition, you have to buy books to get their information unlike computers where they dont you look up the you and in expensive, dont settle for less get the best! over @percent of @caps have old friends of family out of the state that they would still like to keep in touch with. by having a computer you can chat with them through your webcam! instead of calling them up or sending them an email you could chat with them and still see them in the flesh! several computer owners say,  @caps like your actually hanging out with them!  @caps takes over @num days at least to recieve a letter back or an email from them if they live faraway with computers @caps instant ! wouldn't you like to talk to friends and family every day instead of waiting around for a call, email, or letter? i think yes. all in all , having computers is a great investment. i would also like to point out that without computers you wouldn't beable to talk with friends/family online, get better hand-eye cordination, or even have the ability to learn about @caps in just a click of a button! isn't this what you want? 
0.5 i disaree with computers are for you becau if one you don't do nothing this you can meee bad people three you can in samething bad. so if you want to know what happen next you will have to keep reading on. reason are you do nothing because people need to now and because evebady have to lost thing son thing. but if you keep doing nothing ever day your bady will all used to doing fun you can't move or walk. reason two you can meet dad on the computer becauce people can not tell you all the thing you want to know and they can be doing thing that not ok and they can be want by they can be filters. reason three you can all in something bad becauce you can be takeing to you and you say something about your self and they are about something hav and you don't know they use you for something you don't know now tell someone can to you and say you all in why but they tell you so being on the computer far a long time can get you in something big. you don't do nothing, you can had really now you can in something bad. now you know why being on the computer far along time can be bad. now what will you why you that side. p.s. thin i you for taking so are time reading this.
0.8 dear @person, computers are necessary and benefit our community. they do a great deal to help make our lives easier. there is not a day that we do not use a computer in some way or another. the benefits of our computers are they connect us, the spread news, and they make every day objects work. computers connect us in so many difffrent ways. where would businesses be without computers? most modern day businesses are run by computers. owners can now have businesses all over the world. with computers a business in @location or somewhere else in @location can be connected with a building in @location. they can have live video chats together. with the help of the computers they are able to contact any branch of their business all over the world. even smaller businesses use the computer to connect to customers. now a days we do a lot of online shopping. this is an example of how stores connect to their customers. stores can show buyers everything they have to offer including store locations. this can help stores get more business by connecting the buyer to the shop. the computer not only connects stores and businesses but also people to people. @percent of kids in my school own a computer. with all these computers many social networking sites are born. the most popular right now is @caps. students can connect to old friends from other places and even other countries. we have a live chat on @caps or even @caps. @caps is instant messging which is, well, instant. with a simple click people are connected no matter how far apart they are. therefore, computers conect people. computers also broadcast news. without the computers most of us would not no about world news. this includes the @location earthquake. if we did not have the computers to let us know about the earthquake in @location they would be in alot more trouble. they would not have all of these donations. also computers even broadcast national news. almost all newspapers are now online along with on paper too. anyday now they will be completly online. this will drastically change how we learn about news. it would just be a click away. what would have taken days to get here now takes minutes or maybe even seconds. science also benefits from computers. phones now can be personal tws, inernet, and messaging devises. phones are just a tiny version of a computer. cars also have computers put into them. the @caps in our cars are computers; we would be lost without them. also, in cars there are computers to run just about everything else. so, there is not a day where we do not incounter computers. in conclusion, computers benefit us in so many ways. they conect us deliver news, and are in almost all of our technology. could you imagine life without computers?
0.6 do you know that square box with a screen on @caps? or that rectangular snaped objected with letters on @caps? or that other rectangular box where you put a disk, a usb, and you turn @caps on at. all that is a computer. yes! @caps is fun, you @caps play games, go on internet, watch videos, and check your mail. if you had a computer everything would be easy but @caps nor. @num reasons why is if you have kids and they go on your computer you have at home @caps @caps cause them addiction, @caps @caps be inaproprite, and @caps could be exspensive. pleases near my reasons and give me a fighting chance. the first reason why computers are bad because @caps @caps cause addition to your child. @caps a problem because your child bother you and say,  @caps or @caps @caps i go on the computer pleace . and you say yes and when you let thom on they will be happy when you say.  @caps time to act off the computers  they will say  @caps i stay on just for a little longer or i dont wanna act off @caps in a middle of a game.  @caps when they finnally act of and thir nexted day they will ask you again  @caps or @caps @caps i go on the computer  and if you say  @caps  they will cry and throw a temper and the more you let them on the they will wanna stay @caps if you say,  @caps  you will get a the second reason why @caps a bad thing to have a computer is because @caps @caps inaproprite, @caps @caps be inaproprite because you child is growing up he or she will go ento the internet and lat a things like nude pictures or videos about a or a that world to lead your child having sexual intercorse. there you will but at the age of @num to @num years old and you they of inaproprate a computer @caps do. @caps last but not least the last reasons why a computer is bad because they are computers cost about @money more a days and you @caps broth your computer and @caps will cost you a lot get @caps fixed or to get a new one and they will be on @caps even more or they @caps press @caps up trust me i know. @caps @caps why a computer isnt always a good thing. now that you hav heard my reasons i hope you take this info consederations and think about @caps you really want a computer or not they are good and easy but they also have some bad side effects. all the facts are true ans i say about @num people in the world go threw computers every year @caps think hard. do you
0.7 dear @caps @organization, computers are an extremely usefull tool in this modern age. they teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to easily learn about faraway places and people, and allow people to talk online with other people. therefore, i believe that computers have a positive effect on people. hand-eye coordination is a very important skill for young children to master. without it they will have sloppy handwriting, absolutely no chance at sports, and much more. computers help teach them because they need their finger to hit the same key that their eye sees. and because they tend to want to type faster, it will help even more because the finger and eye will have to work in mission to type faster. computers also give people the ability to easily learn about far away places, people, etc. people used to have to spend hours searching for a half decent book on a topic, and then find the specific information they need in the hundreds of pages. now that information is only a few clicks away. say you have had problems with your faucet, it keeps drippy but you dont want to pay for a plumber. you could easily step by step instructions on what to do using the computer, the possibilities are endless. finnaly, computers can allow people to stay in contact with friends who @month live far away. it is more convinient than using a plane because you dont have to have something in your hands the whole time. you can walk away and then came back when you hear that you got a message. it is also very usefull for people such as buisnesmen because they can talk to multiple people at once while still being able to get other work done, @person, author of buisnes magazine tells us in an iterview that it is nearly imposible to run a succesfull buisnes without a computer. how people could possibly say that computers have a negative influence on society, i dont know. but i hope that you will publish this in the paper and show them that computers are necesary.
0.7 @organization, in my opinion computers are good for people. i believe this because many people get to see things that on their daily basis wouldnt. i think that computers have a positive effect on people. i think that many people now a days work alot so they might not have time to remember little things such as going to buy newspaper or they might not even have time to watch the news on tv, but because of computers they can read or see the same things but in less time. some people have a job that includes computers so they could also read the newspaper on their computer while also working. this benefits sociaty its own way. i believe computers are very useful to everyone. c omputers can help people get in touch. they can keep in touch by using webcam and etc. it could also let them communicate. computers allow people to see each other from different places in the world. it gives people a chanve to see the people you couldnt see from afar. in my opinion people can also learn from computers. computers have many positive effects that are very important. they give people a chance to learn things. this can benefit sociaty because the more knowledge people have the better it is. it gives people who didnt get a chance to learn what they wanted to actually do so and learn it. computers do benefit sociaty lets take @person for example he says that @percent of kids believe that computers have helped them in their own way. many people can be bored at times but because of computers and the fun things it has such as games, videos... etc.. people get to actually spend some time doing something like @person stated kids believe computers are helpful because by playing those games it can give them hand eye coordination and help them in different ways at the sametime. (takes away boredom and lets them get good hand eye coordination) computers also benefit sociaty by letting people has such technology. many time technology is needed in everyones life. technology has helped many people and still continues to. computers is one of the technology that helps people. technology can teach people things that they do not even know they could do. in conclusion i believe computers have many great positive effects on people, and it also doesnt only benifit people that use this technology it benifits others in a way too. it gives everyone a chance to learn about things, and do them so i believe computers are a great thing to have.
0.9 dear newspaper, i read an article in the paper @date debating whether or not computers have a positive or negative effect on people. even though, i love my computer, i know that computers can have a bad effect on people. computers can cause people to have a lack of exercise, lack of family and friend time, and lack of enjoying nature. although, computers can help people in so many ways, they can also make things worse for people. in @location the obesity rate has reached an all time high of @percent. a computer is a non active activity, so if you do use it you get no exersise. one time i played on the computer for two whole hours and gained two pounds. your health is also very important. when you become overweight you get the risk of diabettes, high colestral, heart failure, liver failure, and more. my uncle is overweight and was just diagnosed with diabettes and now he regrets all the time he gave to his computer. lastly, people @month say that computers create great hand-eye coordination. computers might do that but is the hand-eye coordination ever used? no, because that person is too busy playing on the computer can you see how computers can effect your health? eighty eight percent of @caps voted that the most important thing in their life was their family and friends. the other twelve percent said that their computer or cell phone is their most important thing in life because they cannot live without it. not spending time with your family and friends is an awful thing to do. when my mom lost contact with one of new friends, @caps regretted not spending so much time with them. also, if you do not spend time with people it could lead to socializing problems. if the only thing you do is talk to people on the computer you develope speech problems. my neibor, who i have never talked too never really came out of his house he always seemed to be on his computer, and no one over. one day someone came over and they started talking outside. when i overheard a little of their conversation i could the words he had trouble saying and he did not have a good vocabulary. lastly, you can also develope relationship problems. not being able to see a real relationship. that is why computers can have a negative effect on not only you, but your family and friends too. in our daily lives we observe nature, and it's beauty. spending time on the computer instead of enjoying nature is awful. for example, if i was to not go outside for a whole day, and i got to spend my time on the computer i would be miserable. nature is a gift that should be given to everybody. also the @caps air is good for your body. without @caps air you would be taking in chemically changed air, which is not good for your body. lastly, everyone reads on the internet about @caps warming but why do we not take action! if you spend your time on the computer you would not be able to help nature. i remember when i read about @caps warming on the computer. so i took action and cleaned our lakes. that is why computers have a negative effect on people. computers can be great in so many ways but it is how much time you give to your computer that is bad.that is why computers have a negative effect on our society.
0.8 to begin with, the learning ability people get from it has improved. the @caps source is very helpful to many people. the communication is much easier than talking on the phone. i believe that computers benefit the society in many different ways. first of all, children and people at home and at school use computers for learning purposes. in some grades at school there is a special typing program that helps improve typing skills. there are also hard drive discs that you can play with to help you enhance on your reading skills. it is just a way to make learning fun for young kids. another great way to learn online is going to websites that have sample math problem and print the sheet out to practice. they are great ways to help learning. secondly, the computer has many more ways to benifit someone. they are helpful for getting your local weather. in the winter you can see if your school has cancelled in seconds. often i get projects where it calls for me to do research on a specific topic and it is very easy to look up simple information. the computer also has different links that are helpful for writing a paper, making a power point presentation, and excel spread sheet. all of those resources can either help graphing results for science class or even typing up a paper for @caps. they are useful ways to make life easier. lastly, computers tend to make communication a little easier. for me, when i'm out sick from school i like to tell my teachers by emailing them and even asking if i can make up any work using facebook, aim, myspace, and skype are all fun and fast ways to communicate with friends. all of the websites pretty much do the same thing but different people like diffrent sites that their friends are on you can email friends and family who live far away and even close. it's a way to get back and forth to eachother. in conclusion, you have heard the different ideas and i consider computers as a benifit. it helps learn, communicate, and most of all do the important things that we need.
0.6 dear local newspaper, i have some arguments to tell you how computers aren't all bad. one you can use them to get information for a project, talk to your friends, or learn about something you have never known before. my first argument is that most people use there computer to get information for a project they have to do for class. for example, they could need information for a country like @location, @location, @location. there are many way you can get this information. so if you didn't have a computer where could you get all this information. if you get it from a it might not have what you are looking for your project. had the computer here a bigger range of knowledge then a have. my second example, is you can talk to your friends you haven't seen or talked to in a long time. there are many ways you can do this on @caps, @caps, twitter, yahoo. you could always because it is always better to make new friends. even better to a family member. i know it is alot better to talk to a family because they already know you. finally, it is always better out something you never knew before or something you have been wondering about. but you could always go on google, ask or wikipedia. they can all help you you have been looking for. but that doesn't mean you can't find it in a book either. they are chalk full of answer and ideas that can help you. my conclusion, is that you can always find ways to get the answer you need. but that also doesn't mean that you should be sitting on the computer when you could be going outside, or playing with our friends. and nothing is better then spending your time outside. so use the time on the computer better. then go out side and enjoy the outdoors.
0.7 dear @caps @caps, i have some opinions on technology is going these days and about how many people shun the idea of further advancement for the understandable reasons that it brings people away from family and that it draws people's attention away from the rest of the world i do see their point but i'd like to make a point myself. while statistics show a @percent decline in recreational activities people also find more things to do and now that the world is more concerned for the environment you will probably see people coming outside again because they heard about some new environmental actavist group to join or they watch a movie that makes fun of live action role playing and decide to give it a whirl. my point being that you never know what your going to discover in the media and its better than sitting outside all day with no insperation, waiting for your parents to get home and give you information from outside you tiny world. the other item i will mention is the music industry and how it is revolutionized with more advanced, and different ways of listening to it in fact the only problem in music today are the artist and how they take advantage of recording studies and on occasion another just to gain fame! without doing anything but sit back and lip sync. but the technology of the day give us the ability to listen to music the golden age of music now. so why not advance and invest in the music industry, it will provide entertainment and fun for years to come. advanceing technology is the music industry actually is probably good for the economey as well i mean if we didn'@caps have new @caps to bell to people every year that would be a huge decline in stock market prices not that were not in a crash right now but it wouldn'@caps be any better. that goes for cell phones too and any other piece of hardware that gets frequently upgraded it's just good for buisness. you see i belive that the point of life is joy so whats better than settling down with mabey a date some candlelight and a romance or thriller on the @caps.v most people will enjoy just sitting down and watching the telly it's easy to relate to. the television has evolved in many good ways it's a way to lay down and unwind learn about so many different things mabey watch a show on @location it makes you feel like being there without actually being there. i helps us get updated on current events shows things that we want to do and shows us how to do it. i for example have learned so much from.
0.6 dear local newspaper, @caps you love computers but fear that you or loved ones spend way to much time on them? if so, then maybe we should @caps something. toomany people have issues with their vision due to starring at computers to long. also, people miss out on other outdoor activities as well. finally, if people are working off of computers for their job then there missing out on same of the other important things in life such as, interacting with family and friends, enjoying the outdoors, or just simply spending time with their close ones. now, are you for or against this descison of people getting  hooked  on computers? in my opinion people should be enjoying things and not spend most of their time on computers. since people are so dependent on computers, sometimes working form one can hurt your vision. the bright white computer screen filled with all those e-mails can really affect your vision. i know my dad always gets headaches and his vision isn't the best thing when it comes to him working on a computer all day. being indoors and on a computer all day long makes you really miss the outdoor activites that their are. things such as sports, nature, riding a bike and many other activities are missed out because of being on a computer all day. only fun and energized people get out and get active. last but not least, @caps you enjoy spending time with the ones you love but seem to busy because your on the computer all day? if so then get up and go have fun! take the wife and kids on a hike or go and ride a bike, its awesome excersise for you, family and friends and its actually fun! so, its now or never. @caps you want to be at home on a computer all day or @caps you want to be high energized and spending quality time with family and friends? most impotantly @caps you want to be energized and healthy with no vision problems and stop those awful headaches? well, without a if you get up and get active it will be the best decision you will make! so, get up, grab the kids and get going on your new and energized, pain free life.
0.9 dear @caps, i am writing to express my opinion on computers benefit to society. i believe that computers are very useful tools for learning and communication, but people today over use that power. you know what i mean @num gamers, @caps and @caps addicts. or those who will do anything just to spend time on the computer. people like the @caps do not spend much time with family members, or friends, or even just outside. they do not get enough exercise, and frankly, abusing computers is not good for your life, physically or socially. some people are working all day, leaving early in the morning and getting back late, so that they rarely spend time with those they love. but if you are hooked on the computer, as so many of us are, you @month just not spend enough time with family and friends. using a computer isn't exactly a social thing. one person with a mouse, a keyboard, and a monitor. you @month say  @caps, but there are also online social networks.  @caps, but how often do you even see those people in real life? computers can take precious time away from you that you could be sharing with your family and friends. that certainly does not benefit society. a major fault in computers is that you have to be indoors. so you cannot be online chatting, or playing a game, or checking your email, outside while enjoying the beauty of the outdoors. sure you could use a laptop outside but are you really enjoying the outdoors? computers and outdoors go together like chocolate milk and fillet mignon - not well. that is the reason why pine tree's don't have outlets (although now you never know what they'll do next). another side effect - that goes allong with the aforementioned statement about computers and outdoors - of computers is the lack of exercise. once again, it is rather difficult to use a computer and jump rope at the same time. when you live as a computer vegetable, your not getting enough exercise as you could or would be. another reason computers could lower your quality of life. now, really, if you use the computer sparingly, and only when you needed to, or when it is nessecary you would really have none at these  side effects.  but face it, the ruth is, computers can be addicting. wether it's waiting for a friend to come online or your trying to get to level @num of  @caps @caps , they can get you hooked. the idea of this article is not to prevent you from using computers, but to make sure you use them like you eat double fudge brownies with walnuts and cream cheese frosting-springly. so, now you know, computers when used to much, at obsesive amounts, are similar to drugs in the way that they are so addicting. as long as you use them correctly, they are a very, very valuable tool to be used, but over used, can be problem causing, and even prevent you from spending time with family and friends, getting exercise and even spending time outdoors. i know you certainly will agree.
0.6 i believe computers are a good thing for several reasons. three reasons why computers are good is that you communicate with other people. you can also use them to meet new people. finally you can also use them for planning. my first reason why computers are good is that you communicate with other people. my parents use e-mail all the time. they taly to my grandparents, then friends, and even use it to arrange events with other people. my use it when people are hurt and i know some people use it to learn about magazine subscription and other thing to buy. my favorite thing is that my parents use e-mail to talk with my grandparents about my birthday presents. my second reason why computers are a good thing to have is that you can use them to meet new people. i know there are alot of websites that match you with someone based on what you like and do. you can also use e-mail to talk to friends and they @month want to see you again and you can meet people that way. therea are thousands of ways to meet new people. you can use chat websites or you can use sites like facebook or myspace. my third and final reason why computers are good is that you can use them to plan a vacation or move dining reservations. for example me and my family went on vacation to @location, and my mom made all the reservations from our computer at home. my parents aren't the only ones. many people travel dening vacation, and propbably @num out of every @num people use a computer to reserve hotels. i also wanted to take you to the other side without computers. if we don't have computers we would have do send mail through the post office and by the time that gets to your house someone could have new baby could have been born. plus we would also find up doing bills and taxes without computer software. my parents life and my life would be very hectic if we didn't have computers. once again i believe computers are good and that more than half of america use them. i believe this because you can use them to talk to other family that @month be far away. you can meet new people through online dating services. then theres the always helpful panning part, so you go online and reserve a hotel on dinner at a resturaunt. plus if we didn't have computers we would have to do bills and taxes the old fashioned. my where you add up and subtract and divide. it's alot less words if you use a computer.
0.7 dear @caps, i am writing to you to let you know my opinion on computers and technologies. computers have now become part of our society and culture and is very important by following reasons. one computers let you surf online anytime you want. two, computers allow people talk online. first reason why computers are so critical in our culture is that computers let you surf online anywhere and anytime you want. this is very convenient. what if you live far away from the nearest library? when you have to write a research paper? jane lives @num miles away from her town library. her mother could drive her ther, but what if she wasn't at home or driving someone else to a doctor's appointment? this is when computers come in handy. jane can just simply go online and do the research! not only that but also,  www.internetsocool.gov  states that information you can find in a regular library is about @num of information you can find online. secondly, computers let you talk with people both faraway and nearby online and videochat. this is very useful for me. since i live by myself in @location, i miss my family a lot. although with internet, i can talk to my family whenever i want! also, you can video chat with your lab partner to discuss how you can make the lab report better! @person, the author of  @caps @caps  also states in his book that over @num million people use internet to videochat for educational purposes. in conclusion, ivideochat @month sound like something to do for lark, but it is actually used for many good purposes. on the other hand, some people say that computers are bad. some say that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising and spending time their family. although,  the @date survey of what people do,  states that @percent of people who use computers are healthy both physically and emotionally. just because we use computers to make our life easier, it does not mean that we don't value spending time with family. in conclusion in our culture because are very crucial in our culture because it can let you surf online and help you interact with people who live faraway.
0.6 dear local newspaper from my point of view, computers are good to society and to the people because they help you communicate with people in other places or with your family or friends or meet with people from other country and you can become frinds. they are also good because they help to develop cordination on your hand with your eye, and they are helpful because you can buy things online. first of all i think that people who know how to use a computer can communicate with their family in other county or meet new people who then become friends with you and you can even meet them after you know them very well. you can even talk with your family through the computers and you won't spend that much money on expensive international phone calls. secondly the computers are helpful because they help you cordinate your hand and your eye. this helps you because if you are a kid you have a big project; you will be able to finish it on time. from your point of view you can actually se were i'm going because after you finish the project you can go play with your friends and family on the patio or backyard. the hand cordination can help you develop mentally sight. thirdly using computers is good because it helps you buy things online, the computer can help you buy thing like a clothes, shoes, cars, house and, many others, anything you need you can buy it online. in conclusion i think people should think about using computers more often either to buy things, to meet people or to cordinate body parts don't you agree with me?
0.7 dear local @caps, @caps people have been using computers for years. but @caps it good for there health. were not thinking about what power teens have with the internet. if you need info. we have lots of great books. if we need communication we have phones. we need to go outside and exercise. @caps the computer another reason why america @caps becoming obese? first, teens can do harmful stuff on the internet to themselves or others. people have invented facebook and myspace. almost every teen in america has a facebook. did you know that theres cyberbullying now. people have humiliated others on the internet. how do we know that the person were talking to @caps who he/she say's he/she @caps? teens give away to much info of themselves, some have gone missing from such an action. the internet @caps a powerful weapon, but can teens handle this kind of power? next, although the computer @caps a convient device. @caps it not true that we have something called books. we cant believe everything that @caps said on the computer . we can get all that we need and more off of books. people lived in the middle ages without computers, but with books. why can we. have we grown lazy to do such a thing as to get up and look through a book. finaly, if communication we seek, then why not a simple text or call. we go through all the trouble of turning on and opening pages just to chat online. we have become lazy because of device's that have all we need in our homes. sure its a good thing but dont forget a bad one to. it seems like the computer @caps another reason for america growing obese. we need to get up walk, hang out with friends, do sports. but how can we when were adicted to computers. it's like a powerful drug. to conclude i think computers are not good for us. teens with the power of facebook. fake and dangerous info when we have book. lastly, our own health. at this point i ask you, @caps the computer worth everything we think it @caps? no, it @caps not.
0.7 i agree with the many peole that but benefits society. computers can be used as a learning tool, allows communication with distant family and friends. lastly computers give you something to do in your free time, such as playing games. first of all, i know many people think that others wasted their time on computers. but most computer users us the computer as a tool to learn and get work done. there are many educational websites that people can go to to learn about any subject want. if you want to know more about different cultures such as @caps @caps. there are websites to tell you everything you wih want to know. computers also help yet work done. there are multiple programs designed to make writing papers or presenting information much easier @month people use these programs to yet ahead in their work and present facts easier by using these programs it is very hard to lose and work that you do because it is all saved into the computer. next, computers are agreat way for many people to pass some free time. many websites are designed for this reason. some allow you to play games and other websites let you watch video made by other people, while some people @month spend to much time on this many offers know moderaton and spread their time even other websites hard videos that are used to portray important issues, for example the president has given many through @caps videos because more often people are on their computers and not watching television. lastly, computers are a great way to communate with distant firends and family. there are so many ways to do, such as email, or many of the social networking websites. my family being immigrants from another country my family. thinks this is a vauables tool for talking with our family, and i am sure that htere are many ohters who use the computer this way as well. people also make and keep in touch with great friends through the @caps. i use @caps-mail as a way to keep in touch with many of my friends that i haven't seen in tears, my parents have also found long lost friends that they had before we moved through facebook i also allows people to communate important ideas faster than a letter could. many scientists use the @caps to publish ideas and experiments. finally, i agree with people who sad computers benefits society computers help by being a tool to learn and get work done, pass free time and see important information and lastly computers allow communcation with very far and distant family members.
0.8 dear @location, @caps has come to my attention that more and more people are using computers for excessive amounts of time a recent study confirmed this reporting that  @percent of @location's population uses a computer for more than @num hours a day . that means people have less time to exercise, enjoy nature and socialize. i consider that the benefits of computers are greatly outwayed by the problems that arise from them to up, computers limit a person's health-both physical and social - and do more harm than good to siciety. spending too much time on computers can deteriavate a person's health by preventing them from spending that time exercising take for example @location, who goes on computer at least five times a week, for about four hours. @location has stopped playing soccer and because she prefers to spend time on facebook. instead of recieving six hours of exercise a week. she now recieves an hour this has to @location gaining weight and losing health. the problem is there are millions of children like @location who are not getting enough exercise instead opting. to spend too much time on their computers. another problem is that people spend less time enjoying nature. now, they choose to surf the web instead. this nads to people caring less about our planet and animals. nature is very important and can be extremely fun, so this is a shame. furthermore, those who choose to spend overwhelming amounts of time on computers tend to interact less with family members. no longer do most children help cook, clean, do chones, or spend time with siblings. one mother says  ever since my daughter got her new laptop, she hasn't gone once to play with her baby brother or friends  unfortunatly the same is true for most teens today computers have limited nou, much time families spend together. in conclusion, computers do harm to society they keep people cooped up in their rooms, istead of exercising, enjoying nature, or having fun with their families and friends. in doing so, computers have become a mause to society. therefore, @caps is crucial that people who spend more than an hour a day on computers use that time to exercise or socialize, even to do nothing at all would be better overall, computers are no longer beneficiery to society.

0.5 dear @person, the use of computers is not beneficial to our society. i fear that many kids will suffer from child hood obeasity, this is because of the inactiveness of so many teenagers my age. they @caps could be enjoying life outdoors and staying active, but they choose to sit infront of a screen all day, everyday. researchers have proven inactiveness is at large due to many, facebook, mysape and twitter users. these websites are nothing but trouble, other than being unhealthy, teenagers all over are being cyber bullied, to the verge of suicide. many are not aware of the several pedifiles and creepos these sights carry, which can lead to abduction, rape or worse. by staying active and being outdoors with your friends could save you from these dangers. go outside run a little, you would be amazed how much a little exercise can help you. also i firmly believe time should be spent with your family, doing family activities and eating dinner with your parents. by doing this you become closer as a family, and it could help you make healthier choices keep exercise. i believe by following these simple steps, staying active, staying off the computer and spending time with the family. is much more beneficial than learning how to type, or talking to your friends. using the computer leads to cyber bulling, and dangerous people, living healthy is the way to be.
0.6 dear @caps, more and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. i support advantages in technology and believe that computers have a positive effect on people. computers give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, they allow you to talk to people online, and you can play games games that can help you with your school-work. do you believe that computers give people the ability to learn about faraway people and places? you can use google.com and look up different cultures and find out how the stuff they do is different from us and what kind of food they eat. for example, in @location, they sit on the floor @caps they eat. we get to sit at a table on our dining rooms or kitchens. @percent of people in would floor. surely, computers allow you @caps my cousin on the computer and @caps important to note that, on computers you can play games that can help you with your school-work. you can go on sites that you on your @caps. show you how your body works for @caps, and tell you about the revolutionary war for @caps @caps. these sites are not boring. this a whole lot of fun! whoever thought that learning would be fun? i sure didnt. the time is now! just think that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends because no matter what, people will always have time for that.
1.0 dear computer experts, @caps this: a family of four is sitting in a small dark room, not talking, not laughing, just sitting lazily in their chairs, hunched over & bored. they aren t communicating with any of their friends, and aren t really doing anything at all. they sit there like lumps. this would happen @caps we banned computers! computers defenetly have positive effect on people because they feed you a constant stream of knowlage, they develop good hand eye coordination, and they enable the people who use them to communicate with others. clearly, they are a positive addition to our world. to begin, computers bring you constant a stream of knowlage. my close friend @person told me recently that she is sometimes sitting at home, and doing her homework, and she needs to look up something. she simply grab her computer, and the information is delivered to her with the click of a button. @caps she didn t have a computer sheld never obtain such knowlage. second, in a survey of @caps @caps @organization, @percent of total computer usage is looking up information, and gaining knowlage. this statistic shows that computers defenetly help them when looking for information. also a recent @organization article on computer usage states that @caps people didnt have computers, half of the world s discoveries would not be around today. you can tell that the amount of knowlage that computers give us is very important! next, using computers builds hand eye coordination as well. children s specialist @person says,  @caps need to be able to play video games, even though they are usually discouraged on the computer. they build fantastic hand eye coordination, and help with many things including @organization & sports.  @caps there were no computers, this hand eye coordination could never developed! also, at @organization in @location, they limited computer use, and as a result of it, the sports teams there all got losing records. could this be because of the lack of hand eye coordination of those students? additionally, at @organization, after a recent survey, it was discovered that @num students who play video games on their computers do better in gym class because of the added hand eye coordination. clearly computers greatly build hand eye coordination. lastly, using computer allows people to communicate with each other through email & other social networks. after a poll from www.@caps.com, we have discovered that millions of users use the computer & @caps to communicate everyday. we wouldn t want to deny them of this, would we? secondly, a friend of mine, @person, who goes to @organization, says that the main way that she communicates with her friends & makes plans with them is by computer. @caps she didn t have one, none of this could be done. furthermore, a recent article by @person a teen specialist at @organization says that when people don t have computers & can t communicate or talk to the outside world, they are more prone to diseases & sickness like depression or anorexia. when they don t talk as much with their friends, these sicknesses are more prone to occur. this defenetly shows that communicating with computers is very important. now, @caps this. the same family as before is sitting in bright, sunny room their computer screens flashing merrily. one of the boys calls out,  hey, look at his   and the rest of his family rushes to his side. their faces aglow with this @organization information. you can see that computers have a positive effect on people because they bring @organization information, they build hand eye coordination, and they allow you to communicate with others. so, computer specialists, what are you waiting for? go to your computers right now & learn some @organization things!
0.4 how does the computer effect people? @caps there are way's that computer's can be really bad and really good , they're good. because people who dont like writing usually just have a computer to type on. but people rarely do that, parent's and kid's stay on the computer not caring about nothing else but the screen the kid's stay up all night knowing they have school they dont even do their homework. i have proof my freind's, research show's, my mother also agree's. i suggest that you will agree on my opinion'. @percent of my freind's agree with me because they have been through this, and they would'nt wake up to go to school. dr @person's of @organization researched how parent's hardly spend time with their family. for example father's they basically always on the computer either working or looking up stuff. my mom say's that when she was younger she loved the internent. she never wanted to get off: @caps i hope youv enjoyed my opinion', thank's for even taking this time to read it. thank's again.
0.6 people often say that computers and technology are bad for you, but yet i think they have helped our society out very well. computers help people through there trouble. computers make our lives easier. by, when you buy things now there are computers adding and subtracting your amounts, they help people find out where to go, and last but not least they help friends and family stay in tuch with each other. with out computers we would have to wait in longer lines for what we want to buy. for instince stop & shop they have computers to check out people and the lines are already long enough. if we had no computers the lines would be even longer because then the people would have to add up the money by hand. also with out computers you would not be able to weigh you good as fast as we do now in grosery stores we would have to hand weigh it. with out computer days at the grorsury stores would be very long. without computers you would not have @caps and places online that give you directions. you would have to have use the bid maps driving to places. those mapes could get lost wile you are driving. you can lose yout spot, and some times you @month mark out the wrong spots on you map. with computers you can have @caps, online directions that can tell you the fastest and easest way to get to your place. also with computers it saves papers on maps and we do not wast as much trees. have you ever been in the situation were you want to go visit your family member out of state but you just dont have the money? well many people have and now insted of waisting (the money they dont have). they can video chat, talk, look at peoples pitchers and keep updated with them on the computer. you do not need to spend tons of money on it, it is all free, they are social networking sites. that people use to keep in tuch with family and friends. those sites you have to use on. the computer so with out computers you would have to travel in a car waste money and the air with your car. in conclution i think computers have helped out society out very well!!!
0.9 dear @caps, @caps you know that @num out of @num students in @num grade go on the computer each night to complete homework and to connect with friends and family? i think the effects computers have on people are beneficial for everyone who uses one. a computer can be used for communication, education, and for accessing important information quickly, such as the local news. now, let me tell you why computers are good for communication. when i was in elementary school, i had a friend who i was very close to and a part of his life. unfortunately, he had to move away. but i still wanted to continue to be friends and communicate with him every once in a while. a convenient way to do this was by using a computer. the computer allows you to easily contact an old friend so that you can @caps stay in touch. different types of communication on the computer can be e-mail, instant-messaging, video chat, online chat groups...etc. this helps people stay connected. that's why i think communication is the biggest effect on people due to the use of a computer. but, a computer can also be used for learning. at school or work, both kids and adults need access to the right information about research projects, vacation spots, learning about animals, food, cultures, and sometimes things as complicated as scientific chemicals. for example when my class researched different things about the @caps @caps, our main source of infromation was the internet on our computers. we researched the customs, the foods, the way of dressing, the traditional holidays, and their way of entertainment. also, kids come home from school and upload their essay and continue to type it. this is teaching them hand-eye coordiantion, and how to type. the computer is not @caps used for just communication. it's a good way to educate everyone although the internet can be used to pass along important local and global information.  @caps and adults often check their e-mail and homepage everyday for the latest news on other countries, our country, the government, and the economy,  says expert @person. i think that the internet gives citizens a fast and easy way to access information about what's going on in our town, state, country, and world. for example, it can tell us about the series of shootings goiong on throughout @location or the many house robberies in our town. us, @caps citizens, wnt to know everything... for us to stay safe and notified on the latest. another example is that i logged on the computer three dats ago and it notified me about the earthquake in @location. but there are so many benefits of a computer. the effects computers have on people are beneficial. it allows people to stay in touch, learn about places and people, and to stay up to date with the latest local and global news. i think you should take my ideas into consideration and publish them for everyone.
0.6 dear local newspaper, @caps you think computers have a positive or negative effect on people? in my opinion, i would say that computers have negative effects on us. this is because we would get less exercise, less time to enjoy nature, and interacting with family and friends. if your on the computer most of the time at home, how would you get your exercise? you wouldnt because the whole time you would be stuck sitting down at the desktop. this is also a proble because this is how obeseity can occur from no exercies, and just sitting all day. or people who have heart problems nad need exercise can worsen by being distracted by the computer. being home on the computer does not let you enjoy nature. instead of going outside in the warm wheather, having fun people are staying home. this is not good because they should be out having fun, not on the computer all day. missing time with family and frinds is unexeptable when your on the computer. this is because yar supposed to keep your family and friends company and not daze off on what your doing on the computer. also you miss family gatherings or leave yar friends lonley. thats because yar to busy on the camourar nad not paying attention to anyone arand you. this is why i think computers have a negative effect on people. this is because of less exercise, less time to enjoy nature, and interacting with family and friends.
0.6 dear local newspaper i think that the effects that computers have on people are that some people become very adictive to them, because some people spend lot of time in the computer doing noting because they just spend their money buying things that they don't need. i also think that computers affect people in the way that they don't spend lot of time with their family. the effects that computers have on people is that some people can't stop using them even if they want. people become very adictive to computers because they spend almost all their time in there. people don't exercise no more because they spend all their time on the computer, shoping things that they don't need they just buy them because they like them. the effects that computers have on people are that some people just to be talking to their friend on myspace. his facebook and other websites that are not good for them. i think that the effects that computers have on people are that they take away people's time because some people spend lot of time on the computers, living their family's alone without spending time with them. computers take away peoples time because they don't spend time exercising or playing out side with friends or brothers or go to a park to spend same time with their family or have a contact with family and invite some friends to come over to have some good time instead of being in the computer all day without doing nothing. computer's take away time or love for your family and they make you spend the time that you don't have. the effect's that computers have on people are bad because people can't stop using them even if the wanted to because they are all ready adictive to them. people can't stop using them because in the computers you could do lot's of things like shoping talk to friends and visit websites that have very interesting things from other countries that are very beutiful but some people can't stop using them because they go to play games or because they are down loding music from websites that they don't have to. in conclusion i think that the effects that computers have on people are very bad because some people spend lot of time on them and they even spend the time that they don't have and the time they need. i also think that computers affect people because they don't spend time with their family sharing good things. the effects that computers also have are that people can't step using them because they are adictive to them.
0.6 dear @caps, you sit down at the computer with a glass water and an afterschool snack, possibly an after work snack. you log on to your many accounts, open some chat boxes with your friends & start researching for your project. as more & more people log on to technology, they seem to come out with new things for computers. some people are missing out, & dont see the negatives, like social relationships failing, procrastinatting, lack of learning & more! beep! one new @caps message. on the computer you can talk to your friends & family, but sometimes people are on so much that in real life relationships fail. you cant type a @organization message or hide your feelings behind a screen. also for kids when they get older, many jobs require customer service, and if you only are good at talking to people on the computer, it cant help you. whatever you say on the internet can be read & posted anywhere, any site, any time, whereas in real life its really you talking. school are learning are very important too, but sometimes i know i have homework but procrastinate and say  @caps @caps do it later, i need to check this out!  putting my learning to a stop. some people dont like school, but its very important in a persons life if you like to be successful, you need to balance school, learning, computer time, and dont forget exercise & possibly work! computers can be helpful with research & guides, but facebook or twitter is going to slow you down. so buckle down start that research! chatrooms, @organization, email and other things can be harmful to you. there are many predators out there who are just waiting for anybody to log on. its very dangerous, and someone can pretend to be someone there not. also, computer all day with no exercise can lead to obesity, and sometimes your hands posture can give you carpal tunnel syndrome. there are many bad things that result from computers. many times in your life youll need to find a balance. dont overlook the negative or you could get hurt. computers are nice to have, but be careful not to whittle away all of your time on it!

0.6 dear @person, i am on the side of computers. you @month think i'm only saying that because i'm @num years old and it is basically what i do for fun. computers do benefit society because they are fun, a source of communication, good for schooling and education, and for work. computers are not just the @caps but also @caps procesor and @organization and everything like that. computers provide games for everyone from ages @num to @num. when it is raining outside your parents are at work and you are by yourself and have nothing to do, turn on the computer. play a game. there are many fun websites made for everyone. computers also provide an exellent source of communication. there are all different kinds of @caps-mail. @caps, @organization, @caps, @caps, and many other sites are exellent for talking to friends. not everyone has a cell phone so when you talk to them via @caps or any of the others it is nice to chat. computers provide an exellent source of education. if you are doing a history project and you need more information and pictures, log onto a computer and @organization it. at our school we have edline which tells us all of our homework assignments. it is extremly handy. now they also have schooling tutors online. it is great. computers are great for work. @organization, @caps, @organization, @organization, and other @organization wear or other compnies. you can find your information and make something out of it. it is very, very useful for buisness workers. as you can see, computers have a lot of great uses. i think computers effect people in a positive way by helping them in positive ways. computers allow fun, communication, educational purposes, and work uses. computers are a good thing to have around, @caps't you think?
0.5 dear local @caps @caps, i would wont computors because it benifits our society. it helps on learn about countries around the world and whats going on. for example if you wanted to no about it's sports, you can just type in name. also a computer can help you with your education. if you were working on a homework assingment and you needed some help you can just go on the computor. it is also very benifial because student can have lots of fun playing games on the comput say like it's a cold rainy day and there is nothing to do, a kid can get some entertainment by going on the computer. it is also a good way to communicate with you friends. for example, facebook, @caps, twitter, and email one all good sources of communication. also it is good for if you have a xbox or a @num you need a computer you need to hook up a card to your computer so you can play online with your friend. it's good to have computors in school. is teachers want some students to go on a website to learn something it is a very helpful source. it is also a good in source because in school if your working on this big project a computer can help you do it. i hope these one all good reason to have computer in our society, and it will benifit us in a number a differnt ways
0.8 dear editor, computers are one of the best things that have ever happened to the human race. they benefit society in every way imaginable, and have numerous positive affects on people. computers improve hand eye coordination, allow people to learn about many subjects that books do not give them acess to, and allow millions of people every day to talk and communicate with friends and family. the most important use for computers is learning. using computers, billions of people gain knowledge that they never would have been able to learn before. many people like myself check the weather on the computer daily, making sure we are prepared or dressed appropriatly for the weather. without computers, i would not be able to do this. also, on days when it snows during the night, i always check the school's website when i wake up in order to ensure that school is still on. this is a helpful resource and i don't know what i'd do without it. another thing computers allow us to do is check the news. with the click of your mouse, you can check to see who won the presidency, or what shows are on tonight. another amazing aspect of computers is that they improve eye-hand coordination greatly. this not only benifits my mom who checks her email five times every minute, but my little three year old sister who loves to move the mouse around, and type in random letters on documents. it could entertain her for days, but most importantly, it helps improve her eye-hand coordination every second she sits in that chair. this improved skill will help her enourmously in her future when she soon begins to play sports, and ride bikes. finally, computers allow millions of friends and family to communicate daily at no cost. if classmates forgot to write down homework they can email the teacher instantly, and know exactly what the homework is and even open the sheet that the teacher attached, and print it out. a couple of weeks ago, my dad went to @location for thirteen days, and it was outragously expensive to talk to him on his phone. so, every couple days, he video chatted with me instead so i could talk to him. hear what he was doing, and even see the view of @location from his window. this was very special to me and could not have been done without computers. as it is so plainly clear, computers help us in so many ways that we forget about like educating us, improving our eye hand coordination, and allowing us to communicate with friends and family. these are just a couple of the positive affects and benifits that computers provide us with.
0.6 dear @caps @caps, @caps a computer is a benefit. they help us in so many ways. it is very helpful, it could make someone's life easier to handle. you could keep in touch with old friends or family. it would be easier for work, and when you're bored, you could play some fun games. it's very hard to have family you can't see and keep in touch with! with a computer you could send messages and photo's to interact with them. you wouldn't have to worry about ever losing communication with them. you could also meet new people. get new friends from anywhere in the world! have friends from all different race and culture. computer's are a great way to interact with others, whether its family or friends. it's always had to do work when you have no clue what it's about! if your ever @caps trouble on something you could always look up information about it. you could learn how to do things or learn more information about a certain item. when you have homework and don't know the meaning of a word, you could always look up the definition of it. they also hold your information. for example, instead of @caps a ton of papers you could simple just save it in your computer. then you could print it out whenever you need it. computers make work easier and help you organise better. computer's also amuse you as well. when you have nothing to do, you could play alot of fun game's. you could also watch music video's or funny videos to get you laughing. they have practicly anything you want to play. you would hardly ever get bored! as you see, computer's are a benefit to people. it's always helpful when you could keep in touch with anyone, have help with your work, or simply keep yourself entertained. without computers life would be harder and boring!
0.8 dear @person, to this day, there are many people who use telecommunication devices, like the computer. some think computers have a posotive effect on people. others are concerned that people spend too much time on them. i think that both these opinions are correct. although using a computer can become an addicting and unhealthy habbit, they teach a person everyday about something, are enjoyable, and help save the earth. using computers is something i know millions of people use everyday, and would think @caps would be difficult to live without. for example, my family owns four computers. we each have our own specific reasons for using them. for my mom, @caps's usually working or checking her e-mails. for me and my sister, @caps's researching and typing of homework, and communicating with our friends via facebook or. so say when my mom is working, or me and my sister are researching something we learn. before these were computers, everyone used, but now that we have the internet, theres no really need to get a book. most of the time people wont even have the book their looking either have to go out and buy get one from the library. now this is an inconvenience to people, so why not use the internet thats quick, and. people also use computers to like i mentioned above with maybe facebook, @caps, or e-mail.@caps's quick, easy and fun. @caps also saves paper which helps the planet. we always use to send letters, but now with these sources, you don't need to much! computers are also fun for kids because you can play a lot of games on bring. now even though i mentioned all those good things, there are unfortunately bad ones too. so many people use computers everyday, and @caps's bad for your physical and mental health. people spend so much time on them that they can get easily addicted. this means they will be on them all the time, and never do other things like go outside. they wasn't exercise which could be bad for their physical health. also, staring at a screen all day is bad for your eyes, and brain. so i think, due to these causes, people shouldn't use them constantly. in conclusion, i'd like to say that people should use computers for learning things, go outside or do something active because spending all this time on computers can result in physical and mental health issues. thank you and i hope you agree with my statements.
0.6 my opinion on computers is that i think it's a good idea for people to go on computers. i think this way because if you haven't seen someone for so many years then you got a chance to see that person or talk to that person through the computer. computers are also good because if you have a project to do from school then you could get good information based on what project you have to do. i like to go on the computer to talk to my friends that i haven't seen a while you could also meet new people and make friends. if there wasn't computers then we would have to look through a lot of books for information, or go all the way to the bank to check your account balance, this is why i think computers are good ideas. on the computer you could see workouts to get fit we don't only have to go to the gym. my dad gose on the computer to talk to his sisters, or play games with other people arount the world. another example i could use is my mom she talks to her family in @location and in other places too. if there wasn't computer's we couldn't our tests, we couldn't get information. i think computers are very good ideas, cause it's good when you got to pay your bills too. we could interact with friend and familys online too thats what a lot of tenns and aults do if there was a rainyday or if its snowing and we don't go the chance to see our friends or relitives. for some people they think it's not a good idea because some people get addicted to the computers, but there is so much that you could do that the computer won't get you board. thats why i think that computers are a good idea and that they are very important.
0.8 dear @caps, people use computer all over the world, for one reason or another, but they are very necessary in our world. that is why computers have a good effect on people today. they help us contact distant family members. kids rely on them for studying or homework. adults need them for their jobs, like sending emails or typing a proposal. thats why computers have a good effect on us. like me, many kids have family across the ocean or just across the country, either way, contacting them is tough. calling them @month be expensive in most cases and sending letters certantly take to much time to reach them. with email, the message will be sent quickly and free. you can also have conversations through email with no problem. another very effective way to contact family is through skype or a web cam. this way you can see your family from miles away in the comfort of your own home. computers help kids too. kids like me always have homework on the computer. it could be typing up a final draft of a paper or taking notes on a historical figure, either way they both require a computer. sure, there are books to take notes on people, but do books type up papers? kids and teenagers can also use them for studying. i constantly use the computer to practice spanish buy using a website with worksheets a flash card to help me. computers nbot only help kids, they help adults too. many adults in @location and othe countries are business men and woman. they are constantly sending emails, typing proposals and all those things. and without a computer all that would be very challenging. business men are not the only ones doing that though. my father, an electrition, has to sned out emails and documents about his latest project several times a week. aside from work, we use them in our everyday lives. for example, ordering clothes and toys, but most popular is doing your taxes online. it is quicker easier and that is why @percent of @caps finish their taxes online. computers have a good effect for people of this age. not only i sthat my opinion, it is also more of a fact. they help us stay connected with distant relatives, help our children stay on top in school and help our parents and other adults in their jobs in everyday lives. not only are they helpful, but they are necessary and i hope your agree with me.
0.6 dear local newspaper, @caps people use computers but not every one agress that it benefits society. in my opinion, computers benefit society. there are @caps websites that can help you find information. computers also allow people to work easily. a third reason is @caps companies are able to use them to gain business. if you are doing a project or need to look up information about something, the internet is one of the easiest ways to find that information. google.com has so much information about almost any topic you can think of. if you are a teenager that doesn't have a drivers license and there is no one to take you to the library, computers allow you to be able to hand in the report/project on time. there are also websites that find you direction, to where you need to go. mapquest.com is a quick and easy way to help you figure out which way to go. computers allow people to easily. if your family member lives far away and you don't have enough money for the phone bill, computers help you to not loose touch. there are websites that can help you keep in contact with old friends that you don't see anymore. computers are one of the only ways that people fighting in the wars can talk to their relatives. they are not able to have phones and sending a letter can take a long time. companies use computers for easy access to the public. if you are a new company, you can put a little ad on the sicle of the screen on yahoo.com and millions of people will see it. they of so use computers to make flyers easily and quickly. making a hundred flyers by hand can take hours. but on the computers all you have to do is make one and then you can print out one-hundred. using computers helps society. you can easily find what you are looking for and you are able talk to anyone you want. also, it is easy for companies to attract business. those are only a few of the @caps reasons why computers are good for society.
0.5 dear local newspaper: @caps i'm @person, @caps going to tell you some positeves & negatives: the truth about computers. first @caps going to tell you some positives about computers. the internet is a virtual at your finger tips, it provides the smartest questions to the most questiners. in the internet every thing is more easy, i mean all you have to do to learn how it works is to use a keyboard & mouse. computers have changed over the years, from to have . yes computers have there are popular chatting websites @caps, facebook, twitter, flickr. it seems cool yes but the internet has a very darkside too! second, here are some dark secret of the computer. so far in the news there have been reports of suicide of the teenager life, reports like: girls killing themselves because lack of . boys killing themselves because . yes we do live in a world where everyone is judged by how they . well there you have it computers are good & bad we just have to be .
0.5 dear local newspaper, i think that computers are giving bad effects on peoples lives. instead of using your time wisely and getting active outdoors, your'e inside your house on the computer playing games or chatting with your friends. if you're those people who easily get overweight or in any diabetic medication right now, i't easily recommend you to do workout or go and invite a friend over for a walk at the park. that way you are enjoying nature, talking with your buddy instead of doing it online, and you'd also be getting exercise. if you didn't notice, you are also doing your friend a favor too. not only are you getting good benefits on the outdoors but so is your partner. getting more active @month even bring your friendship or family bond even more closer. you might also improve your self-esteem because you'll look in the mirror and feel great about your new, healthy looking body. also, if you're one of those people always depressed, feeling lonely, or just in a bad mood, this advice could be the key to your solution. the workouts and activities helps you have more energy you never thought you'd have before. if i were you, i'd stop being lazy and actually enjoy your life and not waste time doing lazy then go.
0.9 dear @caps, i remember when i was younger my parents got two laptops for themselves. internet use was always available, interaction of online chat. it was extremly exciting for them. on the other hand, i got to sit home and watch them have fun. i couldn't go outside, or hang out with friends just because i was stranded insided as they enjoyed the computer. i strongly feel as if computers do not benefit society. people spend too much time using the internet than exercising, nobody gets to enjoy the beauty of nature, and there is less interaction with family and friends. there are many holes being dog while computers one still being used and bought. our society is just going downhill from here. people don't need to be sitting at home inside breathing reused air while using the computer. proffessor @person, a health generalist, stated on @organization news that @percent of all people around @location would rather be on the computer at home doing nothing than going outside and/or getting some kind of exercise. could you imagine all of those unhealthy people not worriying about anything except their computer? the only thing computers do for us these days is abandon our free time. @caps waist @percent of there spare time on their computer. if technology decreases there new games people play, and sites people use, it is likey for people to get out of the house and do something healthy for themselves. @person, owner of @organization, said  i have never seen in my entire life, so many people using there computers and internet. its been quite sometimes when over one billion @caps are online on a typical weekend.   @person later mentions   it's kind of depressing of how much time they spend on computers, than outside and enjoying nature.  not only is excersicing time headed down the drain, but our used to be   beautiful  nature is as well. many young kids these days are watching @caps, they see computer game commercials there parents buy them the game, and all of a sudden they are on it @num. since adults aren't doing there part by idolizing these kids to persuade them to run around outside and do something healthy. the kids need to step up for a change! did you know global warming is caused by the minimum density in the air? if we have almost to no children or adults running around outside, our world is not flowing too well. hence our budget is low, and pollution is extremly off the wall; our nature is going from beatifu to less and lesser. @person, a government official has survey @num people from each state asking about how much time they spend weekly of just enjoying nature and roleizing the beaty of it. the survey reads one in every @num people thoughly breathe in the beauty for at least @num minuests, a week. i mean come on; that's pathetic. maybe if we surely excluded computers and technology for a while, global warming won't be nessicary. i remember when i was about @num years old an i never once got to meet my other family besides my siblings. it was pretty sad because i'm always told i have a huge family that is very known to our town but i have no clue who they are ! this is all because technology was invented. never once have i ever been outside and relaxed besides when i got on and off the bus for school. my parents stand me in my house as they use the computer. the other day i just found out what  show  is because my moms computer brake and now i am get introduced to my other family along with the freedom of going outside. ever since my mom's computer brake she has lots of free time to spend with me. technology ruined my childhood as a kid and without it you get to open up the real importance of life. would you want to become obese, like through global warming, and/or to not interact with family or outside nature? its sadi how @percent of these reasonings are caused by the excessvive use of technology and computers. let's just get rid of it all! thank you for your time @caps!
0.6 i belive that computer technology is a positive effect on people. i think this because it can teach you how to type faster, learn about far away places, and talk to people online. here are some reasons why. my first reason is because the computer can teach you how to type faster. for example, for the use of your fast writting you can get a good job/career and can have a future in your life. another example, is because you can type e-mails faster and don't need to type slow. last example, is that you can improve you typeing skills and become a better typer. my second reason is because you can learn about far away places. for example, you can learn about other countries and how it's different from our country and how their alike. another example, is you can use it for projects, get all your information and be prepare for a great project. last example, is you can always learn something everyday from your computer, like news, weather etc. my third reason is because the computer allows you to communicate with other people. for example, you can talk to your friends and family to check in on them and see how their doing. another example, is when your bored you can always talk to someone on the computer and have fun with it. last example, is you can talk to your friends and plan when to hang out and go outside and get fresh air, that way you don't have to be in your house all day. that's why i think that computer technology is a good idea because it can teach you how to type faster, learn about far away places, and allows you to talk to people online. i hope you agree with me also, and should think that computer technology is a good idea for everyday for lots of reasons.
0.8 computers are today a common havar hold item and some people think its bad for socity when in reality its our most useful tool nowadays. it supply's an easy access to information along with preparing skills for future generations. and giving from lifes sometimes to cruel days through gamming. before computers world spend hours in books and find what there looking for. the computer solves this. this non as simple as typing what ou need to know and hiting the enter key. this improves grades for children and life for adult solving a into the without leving your home and allowing news like yourself to spread into at the moment it's known. it also creates an interactive place for anyone in the world with thing like and or question and answers this allows us not only yo ask opinions and compare responses but to get statistics that @month help us make life altering decions. not only it supply info it also prepare our for the world. with things like children around the world and i social and decion making skills. it also them like web and design as well as simplier things like management and tougher things like business. along with all that though it gives love an copy. online video gaming is today a huge maker in which allows people not only for new as they do anything from dance, build, fight, smithe teilor, and so. and this infact @num of games are ages @num. it also improves at the same time hand eye cordination. so when you have a ruff day tents to brings people happyness. so computers all neccity and put your mind to hard work but @month you your dreams with a little well limit!!
0.6 i beleive that computers are helpful, and useful to us. they provide us with a wealth of entertainment, enable us to communicate with one another, and even help us learn. today, if it's raining outside, or its too cold to do anything, you can go on to the computer or the computer, you can watch movies, play games, and webchat. the computer is a grat machine, and health expert @person sais  computer usage is fine so long as it's limited to about an hour or hour and a half a day . some people complain that people arent getting enough exercise because of computers. but its not really the computers fault that they arent excercicing. in todays modern world, you can call some one, text someone, or page them with computers though, you can do even more, with a webcam, you can video chat with people, and send each other videos. you can also connect with your friends on facebook or myspace. sociologist @person sais that more and more people are connecting to @caps websites, and talking with their friends.  @caps websites are great  @caps also said  @caps enable you to talk with your friends when their far away, or you just can't see them. however, nothing beats real connect.  computers also help us learn. they can answer almost any question you have, and have name a lot. today, most people don't . some people still might think that computers are bad for you, and they cause lack of excercise, but i beleive people have the to make friends. they choose to over use the computer, and too much of any thing is a bad thing. computers today are an invaluble of life, and are irreplaceable.
0.6 dear local newspaper, technology is an important part of everyday living even some people's lifestyle without technology, more specifically, computers, mankind would be lost. we wouldn't be able to learn about faraway places and people research things with a wider range of information available or for some people, talk to friends and family. technology i needed in everyone's life they realize this or not. there is an endless amount of things you can do on the computer and as far as advances in technology this is only the beginning. the internet allows people to learn-and more than just what you would get from a book at the library. you can learn about the culture of @location, the food they eat in @location, or even the way people dress in @location. you can find pictures and of faraway places and find out the currency or of a country. the possibilities @caps computer allow you to do is research. when maybe they through them giving a presentation much easier! furthermore the computer enables people to comunicate with others. for some, this is their only way of communication. if you have a penpal in @caps state, or maybe even @caps country, e-mail is a great way to talk to them it's quick, easy, and enjoyable tool others, however, prefer instant messaging - the message you type pops up almost instantly on the others computer. then they type a response and it comes back to you! either method is a great way of communication! so you see, without technology we would not be able to learn everything we'd like to, research for, say on for language arts class. we not even be able to communicate with some others. and this is only the beginning of what our lives would like without the computer.
0.6 dear local newspaper, i think computers have a positive effect on people. some adults and mostly kids are not getting enough exercise, or even spending time with family. some parents are less active with their kids. kids are failing to do their homework because they are always on the computer when they get home. adults and kids are getting less excersize. sitting down reading or what ever they do on the computer is not excersizeing. they are going to get fat because they eat and sit down and than they get hungery again than eat and sit down. some people say that your getting finger and arm exsersize by and moveing the mouse, thats not really true. looking at the computer screen all day can cause masive hand people are also not spending time with family. they are sitting infront or a computer and ignoring everyone and everything around them. kids could be enjoying other things besides computers. parents could be outside. playing catch with their kids or even playing a board game with them. people are not less active. they are not going out and haveing fun jumping around with their friends. instead they aim them on computers or message them on facebook or even myspace. kids are failing in school because they fail to do their home work after school. they would rather go on the computer. this is why i think computers have an positive effect on kids and adults.
0.9 one evening, @caps i got home from school, i didn't know what i had for homework. i decided to call my friends cell phone, but instead i got her voicemail. i left her a voicemail and called her house phone instead, the same thing bad happened. luckily, i had my other friends numbers i could use. the next day, i asked her why she didn't pick her cell and house phone. she told me  i'm sorry, i guess i was to busy on the computer e-mailing other people.  @caps i think of people being on the computer too much, i think they don't get enought exercise, don't enjoy nature, and spend less time with family and friends. first @caps people spend too much time on the computer, they spend less time excersising. about @percent of people do this and it's not healthy. @caps people do this too often, then they will not get enough excercise and without excersise then they won't be healthy @caps they get older. @caps @person said  @caps adults spend too much time on the computer, maybe @num hours a day or more while eating junk food like chips and soda, they are not setting a good example for their kids. @caps adults get into this bad habit, so will their kids and it's to early for kids to be unhealthy.  i also agree with @caps @person, she is right about how people spend too much time on the computer. second, @caps people are on their computer, its like their face is glued to the screen and they don't care about nature, @caps people do this, i can't stand it. its like they don't care about anything else. what i don't get is why can't they go outside and do something for at least a half hour, then go back to the computer and waste their time then? going outside and enjoying nature is peaceful on a nice sunny clay. you could have a picnic, take a hike, or even hang out with friends instead of playing on the computer. i understand @caps its a bad day like @caps its snowing or a thunderstorm and you can't do anything outside, then you go on the computer. i think that at least @percent of people would try this. third, @caps people are too busy on the computer then they won't be able to hung out with friends or family. @caps your friends want to hang out with you and they want to go to the mall. but you can't because your on the computer, she would be furious at you. you picked the computer over your friends to go to the mall. there's probably a @percent chance she won't ever talk to ou again. and i don't blame her. people who spend to much time on the computer, would barely understand whats going on. @caps someone tells you something, it goes in one ear and out the other. @caps people do this, its really dissappointing because you dont hang out as much as with your friends and family. as you can see, people are spending too much time on the computer than excersing, enjoying nature, and spending time with family and friends. @caps you ask me, i don't play on the computer as much which is a good thing.
0.6 dear @caps, @caps glad to see that you have a debate if computers are good or bad for human society. well i would like to state my opinion if that is good with you. in my letter @caps going to tell the bad stuff about computer and why there not good for society. well i dont think computer are good for society because you dont work-out as much as you use to. i can say that a fact because i use to work-out then a computer games came out and i spent @num hours a day playing it i had no time to spend with my family, i had no outside commaction it was like it topic over my life. plus i know a lot people who feel the same way. the computer is like a addiction. i say this because once you hit the power button you cant get off. all the commution website are hard to get off because there starting to put games on so you wont log off as fast. the have different website that play video of things that are funny. like once you find it you click and a of things so when you look you on same thing else. dont get me wrong you can see and talk to family members you dont see but you dont have ime to go to the park and have fun and enjoy nature it like you looked up. i dont think we should get rede of computers but we should spend least tine as we do know. i know people are going to be upset by waht i say but we as a society are addicted to the computer. every were you look theres a computer. i going to leave on one not would you pick computers or life? 
0.5 dear local newspaper, @caps... scroll... @caps.  @caps you know that only the male coqui is the only coqui that sings?  some facts are easily found on the interneat? the computers make researching easier just imagine not having to drag home those gigantic books home or having to constantly find information in them. first, the computer teach as hand-eye coordination. second, we can learn about faraway places. finally, we can make friends from all over the world. when, the ball goes right out of the parts! the plastic object with a screen(computers) teach us hand-eye coordination. it teachs us this by making our eyes stay on the screen, twhile our hand are on the hard, smooth keyboard. children need hand-eye coordination for ball-playing sports like baseball, basketball, soccer and more. when your in high school and play sports well, you @month get scholar-ships to go to college. college is important because it has a big role in our life so we @month earn great jobs. learning about faraway place like @location, @location and so on is very intersting. unless, your learning about it throught looks, which are dull and borring. the interneat has taken over our and it is resentlessly and without hesitation. the internet takes less time than going to the libary and getting back. also, skimming throught paragraph after paragraph on the computer is much simple.
0.8 dear newspaper, have you notice that now a days more and more people are becoming overweight? well its true. people say that it is because of eat a lot of fast food but i think that since we are always on the computer and not excersing helps contribute to it. also as the technology is getting better it is keeping people from going outside and enjoying the beautiful nature. sitting infront of the computer isn't going to help our environment. lastly, kids aren't getting out of their house to interact with friends and family because technology has been able to let us communicate without leaving our house. @caps not saying that we should downgrade our technology, but we need to find a way limit it. to start on with, technology has a role in the increasing rate of obesity. some @month say that people chose not to excerise but if we limit things then they won't have to chose. as a kid myself, i love to be on the computer. my parents are always trying to get the computer and take the dogs for a walk and i always say  @caps busy  @caps its true, i don't really like to go outside because i have a computer to play games or talk to friends and to be honest excersing to me seems important but i don't do it because i'm always on the computer. i think that other people could feel this way so thats why we need to limit the computer. secondly, global warming is occuring right now and people would rather be inside on the computer then go outside and enjoy the nature. @caps, you @month be able to look up ways to stop global warming, but does it mean you are going to really do it? some @month not because they could just stay on the computer and keep  @caps up  ways to help another things is that when we use our computers, we use electricity, which adds to global warming so it we limit the use of computers then people could go enjoy nature and not destroy it. lastly, internet sites like myspace, @caps, @caps, etc have allowed us to communicate with friends and family but we are still not able to get out and interact with them. when we get out and interact with our friends we gain like communication teamwork and respect friend and family can teach you this with them the computer they can't. also interacting with your family and friend @month let you go in new places that you haven't been before and on the computer you can't go there. interacting with friends & family is better than talk thru the computer. in conclusion if we stay on the computer then we won't get excerise enjoy nature or interact with friends. so we need to act now limit compute usage!
0.6 dear local newspaper editor, @caps you love haveing the enternet at your finger tips. recently, it has been bought to my attention that some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers. i firmly believe that this is correct. my three arguments are its not healthy, the friends you meet up there are siber friends and bad @caps @month occur. first of all, being on the computer too much is not healthy. this reminds me of my friend named @caps. @caps used to be humerous, outgoing and play alot of sports. one @caps day, her mother bought her a laptop. this laptop was blue and white-her two faverite colors. she was on it all day and all night. she took it with her everywhere she went. well, it got to the point whare she stopped the sports, gained some weight and the sadness creptped upon her. she was in a depresion mode. she went to the doctors and they told her that she had to give up the computer and play with it for only two days a week for five hours only. she listened to the doctor and it took her about three months to get back to the fun @caps she used to be. being on the computer too much can harm you and the people around you. second of all, the friends you meet on the enternet are called cyber friends. you don't know who they realy are, where they realy live, or their real age. they can tell you any thing they want because they know that that's a little fantasy world. that is mently not healthy. it is very important for human beings to be socialy active. being on the computer too much can harm your brain also. third of all, @caps @month pop up. if you are the type of person who is on the computer every chance you get like becky, it is not good for you or the device. being on the computer can harm even the computer. well, you've read my arguments and ideas. please take them into consideration.
0.9 dear @caps @caps @caps, the effects computers have on people can be hurting our society or it can also be helping society. as a middle schoolers growing up, i believe using computers can be beneficial at same point but it is also damaging our society. first of all, the internet is full of innapproprate content. illegal uses are involved and can draw in anyone with just s single click of a mouse. anyone in the world can use the technology we have today to  hack  or tresspass someone else's computer. anybody can download songs or documents illegally for free, rather than paying for it themselves. in fact, not only can someone download innapropriate content right onto their screen, they can also be inflicted upon with graphic words or view a website that involves videos with drug use. criminal acts, vulgar language and more. a recent study on internet use from the @organization for internet use includes that  @caps @caps  has a history of a result to suicides or depression in teens. @caps @caps is a form of @caps where someone can chat or instant message someone and hurt their feelings. not only is @caps @caps an issue, however, people can now talk to strangers on the internet. think about how awful it would be if your child had given out their private information online and a man who said they were the same age as your child received it and lied about their age, sex, apperance, and age. now that man can track your child down and possibly kidnap or hurt them. secondly, the internet can also be very unhealthy and can create you to become less social. according to @caps @caps at @organization, @percent of children or teenagers that result to internet use can create a weak relationship with friends and family members if they use the computer too much. it can be very unhealthy for someone, and not just teenagers, to use the computer for an extended amount of time than they should. people can gain the effects of laziness, little brain effort, and lose interaction with the outside world. finally, my foremost reason on how computers can be negative is how addicting it can be. from my own experience, i used to stay up late for hours using websites such as @caps because everyone else was using it. sure, it can be entertaining and fun but using the internet won't be so much  fun  when your academic grades are at risk and you stop communicating with the outside world. adiction can draw anyone in against their willpower. my own brother became so addicted to computer games that he played one game straight for @num hours straight. you can get addicted to one subject until you lose everything else you have. the internet can be great in moderation, however it can be innappropriate, unhealthy, and addicting. if technology becomes too powerful in our civilization, how can we learn to interact with our humanity. more and more peole become involved with technology and frankly it can be quite horrendous in my oppinnion.
0.8 dear newspaper @caps, have you ever taken into consideration how much an effect technology has on our society? well, for numerous people, computers are their lives. they help adults stay in contact with their friends. also, it gives users usefull information about anything you can think of. computers are a great tool to help us with our lives, they help us learn skills for later in life. people who use computers do not spend too much time on them, we need them to live a good life. for example, the internet has many websites that keep people in touch. there are countless sites and to name a few, @caps, @caps, @organization, the list goes on and on. many adults begin to realize that childhood friends seem to fade away as time goes on. with computers, you can chat with each other all night. in @caps, it is also a convienient way to contact friends if they live in different places around the @location. moreover, computers are chock full of information. if a family wanted to take a vacation, they could use the computer to find a place they would enjoy and book a flight there. also, if a student needed to do a report and was not able to go to the library, he/she would be able to use the computer to get the info for the report. lastly if someone had an ailment and didn't know it was serious enough for a visit to the doctors office, they could look it up on the internet. they also have many sites for that sole purpose such as @organization. lastly, computer users learn valuable skills that these who don't will never have. just knowing how to work one is an important skill but there are many features computers have that will help when a job or in college. for instance, making a power point for jobs or just slideshows of a party in your back yard. in @caps , typing is a valuable skill that most jobs nowadays require. and using the computer fine tunes hand-eye coordination. although some @month say that staring at a screen all day isn't healthy, @caps of @caps.s.a citizens say using the computer is healthy for their social lives and we should use it in moderation. computers are amazing tools if used properly and in moderation. the time has come to tell the people computers are usefull to society. they help social lives, teach us skills and, give us information on countless topics. people need them to have an enjoyable life. so, write an article regarding the need for the use of computers @date and notify the people they are making the right decision by using them. 
0.7 dear @caps @caps, @caps a world where nobody has any hand-eye coordination @caps they try to cath a ball it slips away. there are no friendships or communication with other countries. is this really what you want? computers do have positive effects on people. for example, they help with hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and even allow people to talk online with other people. computers have a positive effect on people and the society. first, hand eye-coordination is not something that all people have. however, you can make it better by using computers and that is a fact. computers @caps said that computer help @percent of @caps with their hand-eye coordination. for example, my mom used to have horrible hand-eye coordination but now that she uses a computer and it is much better. oprah said,   @caps i was young i couldn t catch a ball but now that i m older and using computers i m the best.  @num out @num people agree that computer help hand-eye coordination. next, computers help other people learn about faraway places. for example, if we didn t have computers people wouldn t travel to @location. @percent of @caps agree that they would never travel if it weren t for computers it is a fact that people use the internet to learn about other countries for educational purposes. www.exploretheworld.org wrote that @percent of the people who use the website are students. computers help other people learn about far away places. finally, computers allow people to talk online. @percent of people on facebook have at least one friend who live out of this country. it is a fact that countries are better allies @caps their people get along.www.internationalfriendships.com wrote that they have over @num users who talk with people from other countries for example, my friend s mother was born in @location and she talks online with many of her friends. dr @person said, @caps friendships are the best kind because you learn about other cultures.  computers are a wonderful way to talk to other people. now @caps a world where every country got along because of online friendships. where adults could play a game of baseball because they got their hand eye-coordination back. where students could learn about distant places they didn t know existed. does't that sound great? computers teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway people and places and allow people to talk online. so @caps @caps computers do benefit the society.
0.6 dear, @organization are a major part in everyday life. they are used by just about everybody. there are so many benefits if you know how to use one propurly. they help you through everyday life whether your trying to find this song that is stuck in your head or trying to file you taxes, computers are a nececity in every house hold. they are also a great way to learn. you can look up a question that has been buging you or you could learn to play a new song on your favorite instrement. either way your learning. so i think that computers deffinetly have more of a positive effect on society then a negative one. computers are also a great way to interact with family and friends. some computers even have built in cameras that lets you hold conversations with peers through the computer while seeing each other. this is great if you have family that lives far away, or your in a long distance relationship. another benefit from the computer is that it is great for organizing things. wheither it been @caps or @caps you can count on your computer to keep it all organized some computers also have a built in callendar that could help you plan out your day. but say you don't know what to do that day. well that brings me to my next point. computer are also great for looking up places. for instance say you fly to @location for the first time on a buisness meeting and you arrive a few days before the meeting. so maybe you diside to go sight seeing to some of @location's most eligant spots, but have a computer you could look up some spots and be on your way to having a great day. overall i think that computers make the world go round. they will never die out, that is why everybody should know how to use one, and if you don't you should hurry and learn as soon as possible.
0.7 dear conneticut @caps, you like to catch up on your favorite television showscar shop for the latest trends? or maybe even planning out a get together with some of your old friends? well with todays great technology you can do that on the computer! i can see that the experts are trying to decide whether or not computers are the healthiest thing that benefits our society but in my opinion i think they are great! as you @month not know i am @num years old and have a @num year old brother; we spend alot of time on the computer not just for homework. i like to shop online for discounts and sales where i know thing are cheaper than in stores. i know my brother likes to go to concerts and buy himself the latest video games. my grandparents are older and don't watch alot of tv and read the newspaper so the computer is great for catching up on your favorite tv shows and or the news. with these great pieces of machinery you can chat up a storm with old friends on facebook, @caps, and @organization. @percent of teens @caps are shopping by brand names, like: @caps, @organization, @organization, @caps. all of these clothes and designer stuff is everything we want, but half of us don't have the money. if you go on the computer you can get all of these names and items for less than @money compared to %@num. computers lower the price of things we want and need. i, @caps a days grandparents try to have a decents conversation with their kids or grandchildren but they go right vack to when they were little. as a grandchild to my @person all she used to talk about was her days going through the great deppresion, but with computers she got to catch up on the news and @caps i can sit down with her and have a great conversation. you can also catch up on the shows you are missing when everyone is talking about them in school. the kids won't be missing out! when i was in @num grade i got my first facebook, i thought i was so could! that @date i went to camp and met all these new kids and found out that they all have facebooks. @caps i keep in touch with them, with out lossing my friendships. you see, i know the scientists or experts are probably smarter than a @num year old girl but i know that most teenaters and parents have facebook and say its great because we connect with people around the world. so i know these experts are going to make the best dicision on whether or not computers benefit our society but please take my ideas into consideration.
0.7 computers are great technology, but they have a terrible impact on peoples lives! computers cause children to fail and lose their exercize. the children also put their self in danger by joining a few different websites. don t waste your time in a boring computer screen! i am almost @percent positive that the students who are doing poorly in school, are the students who go home, throw their back packs in the hallway, and start playing silly games online. my mom use to go on and on about how my dad spents to much time on @caps, when he would only go one @num minutes a day to talk to family members. now, my mom created a @caps, that @caps said @caps was gona only go on to with the family, but @caps plays all the pointless applications, such as,  cafe world.  @caps waste her time on @caps whenever @caps is home, when @caps could be going out and spending quality time with the family or out with friends. something i havent mentioned is, i use to be one of those students who come home, throw their stuff in the hallways, and turn on the computer, the only difference is i didnt go online to play games, i would go on to talk to my friends i just saw! i relized after i got my report card that my gades were horifyingly terrible. my dad then disconected my @caps, and i beleive my grades have gone up. at first i hated my dad for disconecting the @caps, but now i want to thank him for breaking a disapointing hoby of being online whenever @caps home. he also mentioned to my sister how much exersize @caps was loosing all because @caps wanted to play online. in alot of ways, computers are pointless! do you know how dangerous some websites can be? i once watched a television show at my aunts house, and an old creepy guy started a website were the teens had to video tape themselfs choking themselfs and who ever did it the longest won. about a hundred students died from playing the deadly game. there's also a website,  blogtv.com.  were teens go online and go live on a webcam were anyone can watch them. i remember their was a week when my cousin, denise, and her best friend wanted to see who can get more veiwers. the two girls did unaproprient things on the webshows such as, flashing, dirty dancing, and showing body parts. the two girls were then banned from the website, but this was after people had screen shoted them and posted pictures of the girls. this should not be allowd for anyone to do, it's disterbing! stop wasting your life people! go out and have fun, dont let the @caps keep you home. the @caps is unsafe and pointless.
1.0 i think we can all agree that computer usage is a very controversal issue. in my opinion, i believe that computers have a negative effect on people. for instance, it's not safe and children can get into all sorts of things on the internet. also, people spend too much time in front the computer now a days, @caps, its a major distraction and also a negetive effect on kids. school work. it's now or never! do we dicide that computers have a negetive effect? you decide! isn't every parents biggest concern the safety of their children? when on the internet, kids are capable of accessing anything and everything. sometimes kids don't even look for bad things, they just pop up. would you want your child veiwing things that you have no control over? also, websites like @caps.com one one of the greatest concerns when it comes to internet safety. although you are supposed to be at least @num to have a @caps, most kids lie about their age. did you know that @num out of @num @caps users lie about their age? and it's not always a @num year old saying they are @num, it could be a @num year old saying they're @num! not only do people lie about their age, they lie about who they are. is this the kind of internet exposer you want for your children? put a stop to this right now! more than @percent of @caps are overweight and unhealthy. this is another negetive effect computers have on people. it's a gorgeous @date day. bright blue skies, cotton candy cloulds, the sun is shining, and there's a nice warm breece. perfect day to go out and get active, right? wrong! none people would @caps be inside on the computer. instead of going for a walk, people would @caps spend hours on facebook. this is a serious concern to our health. people don't exercise enough as it is, and then when you add computers, people will never get active! instead of playing video games onlin, people need to be reminded that turning off the computer and playing a fun beighborhood game of baseball is just as fun and much more beneficial. this is just one step @caps need to take to get a healthier lifestyle. wouldn't you agree? did you know that kids that spend more time on computer are more likely to do poorly in school? surely, if nothing else will convince you of the negetive effects of a computer this will @caps than coming home and doing homework, more time is spent in front of the computer. as a student, i will admit that the computer is a very tempting distraction and can easily pull a student away from their studies. you can't expect a child to make the right decision and tell their they have to go because they need to study. so you do! take action now, or your child will definately suffer. the time has come to decide. do you believe computers have a negative effect on people? it's clear that the computer is not safe. not to mention, too much time is spent on the computer instead of being active. most importantly, computers will negetively affect children's grades. don't wait another minute! let's agree and do something about this!
0.6 dear @person, the advansing technology is showing a very negative affect on people. because of computers people are spending too much time on computer and less time doing things that are better for them. first, spending too much time on the computer can be bad for your health in many ways. for example, looking at a bright computer screan for more than @num min at a time is extremely bad for your eyes. the brightness damages your eyes and can lead to severe loss of vision. also, if you spend all of your time indoors and on the computer you will not get the exersize you need. @person, were you aware that for every @num min you are on the computer you should spend @num min outside. it is very important to get fresh air, sunlight, and exersize. moreover, another problemwith computers is that you don't get as much interaction with people. with online chatting you can't know what the other person is feeling like, @person, or if you are even talking to other person you think you're talking to. it is much better to interact with people in person, face to face. to have good social health you need to hang out with friends, and laugh, and have a good time, not sit in a dark room and talk with online friends. @person, people need to interact with real people. furthermore, computers can be very distracting to many people. for example, @person, say you needed to type up an article for the paper on the computer, but you decide to play a game for a min, or look something up, or talk with a friend. you say that it will only take a minute and then you with type the article. but when you stop all of a sudden you played for @num hours. then you have to stay up later to finish. computers are extremely distracting. people of all ages have this problem of being distracted by computers and not gettind work done. in conclusion, computers, although an advance in technology, have very negative side affects. @person, i feel that it is our job to tell the people of the negitive side effects of computers. it is our job to help people over come the side affects of computers. please @person, we need to help the people by writing an article in the paper to warn them of the terrible effects computers have.
0.6 man has always been interested in technology. computers are just one part. i think that computers have a positive effect on people. they teach hand eye coordination, saves trees, and allows people to learn about everything. hand-eye coordination is a key part in our every day lives. driving a car or writting all invile hand-eye coordination. i remember a few years ago i didn't have a great hand-eye coordination i had trouble catching a ball. now days i spend up to on hour and a half on the computers. i have noticed my hand get neater and i can catch a balls with ease now. do you want to be the one to crash your car because you have bad hand-eye coordination? computers not only increase your hand-eye coordination they save trees too. using a computer dosn't need any paper. you can read and write with out using a single sheet of paper. since the computer @percent of tree cutting has stopped. saving trees help us stay alive. trees put out the oxegyn that we breath in. some say that computers are causing people to spend less time enjoying nature. i think that if it wasn't for computers we wouldn't have much nature to enjoy anyway. lastly computer help people all around the world learn about almost anything. i scince kid, the head scientist says that  with the computer we are able to toll the world of our discoveries much.  @caps. @person say  @caps many people are laying had their die to the computer, they learn @caps many nutrition facts from the health sites . thanks to the computer we found a doctor to help my dad get fixed. the average people can learn about non average things any day. there are even dictionarys on the internet with many diffent translations that you would normily need about @num books to do. the computer is one of the greatest techlonagicly advances to this day. it has help our world is @caps many different ways too. hand-eye coordination is @caps important and is preserving our environment. if you don't have knowledge you cant get anywhere in life. our whole world senses is. 
0.7 dear editor, i think people are using computers to much and are not benifiting as much as loosing from it people are getting less exercise, not seeing nature, and not spending no much quality time with their family and friends. read on to find ou more. first of all, people are not getting enough exersize. especialy children, they spend to much time on computers and are becomeing over weight. america is in a crisis with child obesety. so computer have chipped into that. many adults are over weight because they sit at computers and work as play games all day. i reason that computers are more unhealthy for us. secondly, people are not going on hikes or trips to see the beauties of nature. earth has many things to offer, new things to explore and discover. people can be discovering many great wonders. finding new species, is something you need to explore nature for: animals, fish, plants, there are many out there waiting to be discovered. reason @num why computers are not benifiting us. thirdly, family and friends are not spending as much quality time together as they should. realitives you talk to over computers, why not talk to them in real life. friends chatting online on facebook, aim, things like that, why not talk to each other in person and have fun memories with each other? more kids are spending time on the computer than sitting down eating a family meal together and expreriensing what a family should talk about. reason @num on why computers are not benifitting us. in conclusion, computers are taking over our minds and were not getting much exersise. seeing the beauty of nature, and spending less more with their families.
0.7 technology, such as computers are very big. i belive computers have a good effect on people. people that use computers mostly use it to connet with family do research, or to be neat and not write it on paper. i belive that people who don t think computer make a good effect on people shouldn't bother wasting their time using one. @percent of people only use computer to connect with family. usually your family either lives far away or in another state and you dont get to see them very often. thats why i think video chating on the computer is a good thing. also is a family come up you could @caps-mail @caps your family members instead of calling them because they would talk to you forever. lastley if you use myspace, facebook or twitter you could connect with old friends and not just family members.  @caps my teachers enjoy it when i use the computer to do my work, they said its alot neater  said @caps romano from strong middle school. teachers perfer it when you use the computers to do your work. when you are writing a book report or you are writing a story, you would want to use,icrosoft word of something to write out your paper so it is easer for teachers to read. also if your in science class and you need to make the chart you would want to use exal to make the chart or graph look more professional. lastly is you wanted to do a presintation on bloody @date or little @caps nine you would want to use a power point instaed of just reading from note cards. if people didn't have google or yahoo they wouldn't know what to do, computers are very good for research. if a student to do a presentation on something they would want to know more about it and look,the topic up. also if your family was having a discusion at dinner and you had no idea what they were talking about you would look it up online, lastly if you just wanted to find lyrics to a song because you and a friend disagreed on something. once again i belive that computers make a good effect on people, good for connecting with friends and family. good for being neat and lastly good for reaserching anything!
0.6 dear @organization, i believe that computers are a good source of technology. the reasons which i am fighting for tell why, kids are in school more than half of the school day. parents should be limiting there childrens use and what they do, and computers are a way of contact and research. to begin, kids are in school more than have of a school day. how could children stay on the computer when there in school learning? they can't. in school you get alot of exercise because your always movign around. after school kids usually do homework or go out with friends. computers don't have effect on people, if anything it makes them smarter. secondly, if children have a computer at home their parents should be limiting the time and what exactly they could do on the computer. the people who support advances in technology are correct, computers open up imagination, and learning. parents of the children that have computers should be more worried than anyone else and if they are , they should just take the computer away. parents sould also take their kids places more often so the schild win not have to go online. lastly, computers are a way of contacting others. if you don't have a phone, you use a computer to go on your email, or personal websites. also poeple need computers for schol work and for their jobs too! another thing numerous peopel use a computer for is research and reports. we need our information! to conclude, my thoughts are very important to consider because, mny other people would be shy to wirte this and get it published in their local newpaper! i would like to say computers are not interacting with family, friends, nature or anything of that sort. we as a whole need computers to do daily life things, without be able to go online, or save files we would be lost! so i will say again to consider my ideas. thank you.
0.5 dear - local newspaper i agree thats computers are good for society. without computers a lot of things couldn t be done. computers are sometimes the easy way out. and thats why i love them. computers almost makes anything possible. now say if your an elderly person and you cant get up and your bodys really bad. well all you need is a computer. you can pay your bills online or you can get a job online or even shop online. all you need is a computer. computers are also good if your lazy. you can just lay in bed all day and go online to work or to the mall and order things all youll have to care about is personal hygenic. sometimes computers take a lot of stress of you. no more ignorant co-workers or no angry boss everythings a-okay. computers are also swel because its the eazy way out. but you have to make sure you get a good computer. not and old one because it can breakdown. dats one reason why computers arent so good. but as i said computers are very good they might be a little pesky but ones you get the hand of them everything gonna be alright and remember you can do almost anything with a computer.

0.6 the idea of the removal of 'offensive' material from libraries is understandable. some believe that this material is not appropriate for anyone to view. however, because we all have different opinions on what is offensive, i believe that books found to be offensive should not be removed from the shelves of the library.      first, i believe that if this policy were to be in effect in libraries, there would not be many books left on the shelf. offensive is a relative word. what @month be offensive to one person @month not be to another. every has a different opinion on different matters based on their beliefs and life experiences. many books have things people disagree with, but expressing this is a part of freedom of speech. therefore, if everyone complained that they found a certain book or movie to be offensive, there would hardly be anything left, as katherine paterson said.      the purpose of a library is to provide the people who go to the library a resource. if the sources were censored in such a way, it would be hard to get information. sometimes, it is beneficial, even, to read an opposing view or side to have more knowledge on a certain topic and see things from a different perspective.      however, some books @month not be entirely appropriate to certain people. for example, some material in the library @month not be best for small children to read or view. in this case, i do not necessarily feel that they should be removed from the shelves rather than placed in an area these children do not have access to.     having books, music, movies, or magazines removed from the shelves if they are found to be offensive is in my opinion, a ridiculous notion. it hinders expression. people have different opinions about what is offensive to them and it would be very boring if everyone thought the same. if someone finds something particularly offensive, i believe they just should not view it
0.4 i think that all the bad books should be taken out of a library. all the bad books, music, magazines and movies no one really wants to read. if a kid picks up the book and reads it, and there are bad content in the books, magazines, music and movies that would be bad to read. if they are young enough and they don't know if the movies or anything else in the library are bad, then it's the library's fault for letting them get the book movies, music or magazines. if the parent doesn't know that their kid read the book their parents will be wondering where they got bad phrases from. there are people that think that any libraries should have any bad books.     there are many things in books that parents don't want their children to read. there are things like books that talk about sex. there can also be language that the kids should not read. i know for sure, that i don't want my kids to read anything bad when they grow older.         there are also music that parents don't want kids to listen to. there is things like sex songs. there are also things that don't say sex directly, but imply it. i never want my kids to listen to bad songs like that, i want them to be responsible and not listen to terrible songs.     there is also movies that i don't want my kids to watch, because of the content of the movie. there are so many things in this world that contain bad things, which all have something to do with sex. latly all the movies that came out are very inapropriate.      their is one more thing that i think is very important, which is magazines. there are many things that can happen in magazines like porn. i hate when kids are tempted or forced to look at porn. i think in general we should get rid of porn, and descusting pictures in magazines.
0.6 libraries are our way of knowing what has happened in the past whether it is all fact or maybe fiction.  no matter what type of book it is, it still tells us a story of another place and another time. libraries should not be censored.     taking away one book because of one sentence that seems vulgar and inapropriate for young readers is wrong.  i understand that reading books with adult material such as drug abuse and sexuality can lead to experimentation but is that not life?  at least once in our exsistance on earth we find ourselves curious about something at we try it, just to see what it is like.  it is all a learning experience.      history would most likely be the touchiest subject in our libraries mainly because we are asshamed of what we acted like thirty plus years ago, discrimination in @location, the @caps, and now the wars in the middle east.  some countries do not even teach their own history to students in school because they are embarrassed of what happened or afraid that it might happen again if the students know @caps, why and what happened.  reading and knowing about what our ancestors did will help us lead a better future not distroy it.      today's media has overflowed with adult material not suitable for kids under @num.  if anything we need to start censoring what we broadcast on television and also what we post on the @caps and leave our libraries alone. most of the books that are in our libraries has been there for like forty years so it is completely pointless to remove it when it has already educated young minds for over forty years.      i truthfully do not know why you would want to remove books or censor them with a sharpie marker.  all that is doing is giving readers less material to read.  in @location, elementary educators are not required to teach their students @caps to spell, at all. i walked into a third grade classroom and watched a girl spell @caps '@caps' thinking that was the correct why to spell @caps.  the @organization's excuse for not having teachers teach @caps to spell is that they should learn that from reading books everyday.  well guess what @location, with the @caps, gaming systems and ipods, little kids are not taking to reading like they did ten years ago and we are going to have a lot of future adults not know @caps to read and this is what it is going to be like.      '@caps @caps do you spell encyclopedia?'     '@caps should i know, i wasn't taught @caps to spell in @location.'     you see what i mean, so if you are going to take away the ability to spell you better not take away our books becuase they are the only things teaching our @organization's future on @caps to spell simple words.        today we have the @caps, gaming systems, ipods and @caps to intertain us on a daily basis.  no one is taking to reading as a way to relieve boredom, they are just sitting on the couch watching television.  and now if you reduce reading material for teens and young readers you are not incouraging us to read.  you are taking away all of the interesting parts of a book.  to be truthfull i will read and reread a book many times over if it is a good story with some extra sizzle.  i do not enjoy books that do not have drugs, alcohol, family stress, war stories or even some sexuality mainly because books without that are boring.  when i read books like that they make me feel better about my life and @caps i interact with others.  i have learned @caps to deal with all of those things from books.  most of my knowledge comes from those types of books and i would hate for my children to not be able to read the same materials as i did at their age and learn from those books
0.4 many @caps have different opinions about what's appropriate and what's not. it's depends on one's beliefs and morals. i personally don't think that there should be any censorship in libraries.     i think that @caps should have the freedom to choose what to read, watch, or listen to. each person should be able to make a decision depending on what they believe. it also depends on a person's age and maturity level. some parents let their kids watch certain movies that maybe other parents wouldn't. the situation is different for each person.     it's hard to judge certain materials because some @caps might find it acceptable while others might not. there would be contraversy over virtually everything because everybody has different standards of what's acceptable what's not, and these standards would clash with each other. it would be impossible to make sure that nothing in libraries would be offensive to @caps. if someone finds something offensive, then they don't have to check it out.     i also think that there are some things that can be done to help appease the argument. for example materials can be catorgorized by maturity level. that's what movie ratings are for. materials should be organized that @caps can easily see if they would be offensive or not. for example all the kids movies and books can be put together so that way parents don't have to worry about their kids seeing or reading something that would be inappropriate. it should be obvious to @caps who would find it offensive and who wouldn't      @caps should have the individual freedom to make decisions for themselves. a library is a public place for anybody to go check out anything they want. just because somebody finds a book offensive, that doesn't mean that nobody should be allowed to read it. that being said, certain things can be done so that @caps would know if something would be offensive or not.
0.4 from my own observations i do not beleive that any materials should be removed from libraries.  all students have the right to read/learn about different subjects.  even if that includes some of them being offensive.     some subjects might be considerderd offensive, like the holocaust for example.  if we didnt learn about what happened during that horrific time it could possibly happen again without us even knowing that it has happened before.  but it is the students choice to read about that subject or to simply ignore it if it is cosidered offensive.     in conclusion i do not beleive that materials in libraries should be censored or removed from shelves.  people need to learn a little about everything that goes on in this world to be a better, more educated, well-rounded individual.
0.6 what do you want your child being exposed to?    in my own opinion i believe that @caps shouldn't be taken off the shelfs, because kids know what books are appropriate and innappropriate for them. this @caps why the library has @caps 'kids' selction away from the 'adult' selction. they know their boundaries, and i don't think a librarian would let a child check out anything innappropriate. the library @caps a place for all sorts of books for anybody to come and have the right to check them out.   also, @caps not just librarys', @caps can be seen or heard from schools, on the radio, t.v. and video games. any where you go they're more likely going to see innapropriate actions that take place. so as a parent @caps your job to keep your child away from the things you don't want them to see or hear as much as possible.       the only way a child can be exposed to this @caps if their parents are unattended and irresponsible. someday your kids will ask questions about that that kind of stuff they hear or see at school from other students. just be open and honest at the right time but in a mature clean matter.      i know alot of young children these days who are being exposed a lot from violent video games, music about drugs, alchol, and sex. @caps really bothers me, because when i was their age i had no idea what @caps even was or meant. @caps's wrong for the parents to let them be around that when they know @caps has a label on @caps saying '@caps@number @caps', '@caps'  or '@num'.      every time i hear a child say something about this aweseome video game or cool new song they heard on the radio about drugs, violence and etc, the children tend to get younger and younger every time. i don't understand why parents let them be exposed to that unecessary stuff
0.4 they were talking about thinking of a book that no one should take off the shelf. but if the author had the right to remove the book from the shelf - that work i abhor, then everyone else should have the same right to remove the book from the shelf. but then, they would have no books left on the book shelf for any of them to read. they think that they should get some books that are not found offensive. this is what they should do about books that are found offensive.     if kids were reading books that the author found offensive, they should get rid of them. the books that were found offensive should not be read at all. books that are found offensive are really bad for you to read. offensive books should not be anywhere you are at. if you are going to read a book, do not get a book that is offensive.     non-offensive books like @caps, those kinds of books are not very offensive. if books were not offensive, people would read them very often. if people were to read books very often, there would not be enough @caps to do anything else. we do not deserve offensive books that have bad things in them. people deserve to have better and not offensive books.     every day we read books, but do we know if they are offensive. if we did not know about the books we are reading were offensive, then we would be saying things right out of the book that we should not be saying. if we say stuff right out of the offensive book, we would get in severe trouble. getting in trouble can mean some serious punishment. when you get punished, it could cause you to lose something for a certain amount of @caps.     in conclusion, you understand what you can and cannot read. you also understand about what to do with offensive books. that non-offensive books can make you learn something. you can also understand about what happens when you say bad things out of the offensive books. and that you can end up losing something for a certain amount of @caps.
0.2 the way that the books, musics ,ect. are made for people basicly for that age group. like if that particular book contains profanity that some find offensive, then they should ignore that book and move on to the other book that is more fitting for that person rather than starting a controversy over that just of one book. some stuff will have lables on them like parental guidence to show that only particular age person can have. from my experience is that it's ok, but if it gets out of hand then i just leave it and go to the next thing. although rmoving the books from most people might not help alot because some people would like to have that book that they won't find anywhere else. the librarians can put that particular book in the older age section of the library and have the kids book in the younger section of the library. so hopefully this might help the problem that you might have for people to enjoy that books, music, magazine, ect.
0.4 i @caps would like @caps if nothing was censored, but i don't matter, right? i am the kid that has no choice in the matter. @caps should i not care about what i am forced not to see? i am sure there are alot of parents that dont follow the censorship rules. like buying a rated '@caps' movie, or game for their kid that is @num, and not @num years old, but @caps does matter that the parents are following the law. i say shrew the law, because when @caps comes down to @caps, its the parents right to tell/show there kid about things, not the goverment.      i think that @caps have never really had a choice in matters that affects them directly, and i think we should. @caps have to follow what ever rules untill there @num years of age: @caps? i wish i knew @caps, but i dont. because there is no logical reason for @caps not to have a vote on what affects them.           for all i know there could be a law out right now that is going to make my generation less powerfull then the last generation. i am not saying that this is true, i am only saying that its possible for some thing like this to happen.     video games, they are my weakness i admit, but i don't see a reason for games to be censored. when people say things like '@caps who play video games with violence will make them murders.' @caps makes me frustrated. there is not one single thing that proves that.      i have known @caps who have been censored all there life, and when they learn about @caps all they cant even handle @caps. its sad really to not beable to watch the news and learn what is going on in the world. just because they have been kept away from all that all there life.     i don't know how or where they get this censorship idea from in the first place. did their parents tell them @caps was bad, and never watch/read @caps? where did they hear @caps from? i beleive @caps came from the media @caps self. i can see the headlines now, '@caps watching @caps movie cause them to be murders.' then they would have some made up percentage on how manny @caps turn in to a murder that watch @caps movie compare to @caps that don't.     what i am really saying is that i try not to let other peoples beleifs get in my head and change my own beleifs. even by me writing this @month have cause someone to change there beleifs, and i really @caps hope i haven't.
0.6 have you ever been offended by a movie, book, song, or magazine? did you have a choice on whether or not you watched and/or read the item? the question that seems to be of intrest to people is should these items that are offensive be taken off the shelves. i don't think they should.     i am sure that you could ask anyone if they have ever been offended by a movie, book, or magazine and all of them could give an example. i doubt they ever watched the movie again and if they did it obviously wasn't that bad. if something offends you, don't read or watch it. if you don't want your kids watching something, don't let them. you can make that desicion. no one is making you watch or read any of that.     i know i have watched a movie or two that i probably shouldn't have. i've even read some books that are not the best, but i choose to read them. no one forced the act on me.     some of you @month ask, '@caps about at school?' if a teacher assigns a book to read and your child does not feel comfortable with it, then take it up with the teacher. they will be more than understanding and possibly give your child a different book. they might even explain why he or she is having the class read the book and why the children need to be exposed to this type of literature.     there are always going to be offensive books and movies out there. if you take out all the books in a library that has offended someone at one point in time, you probably wouldn't have much of a library left. the shelves would be bare.     you have a choice to read or watch something. if it is offensive don't watch it. everyone has different views on that book or movie. it @month be offensive to you, but to the next person it might be a really good show. i don't think offensive books, magazines, music, or movies should be taken off the shelves.
0.4 you know when you find a @location book on the shelf and discover that the content in the book are not word that are oppropity for children to read. or when you go to copy something and you notice a magazine on the table and find out that the cover of the magazine has an image not for the young mind see. or a movie or music that you see and the content from them shocks you and makes you that they bleep those word. i see it more better to have offensive items such as: books, music, movies, magazines, and etc. removed from the shelves, because those words and pictures will poison the minds of children and children learn from the world around them stuff like will make the child think that's how your suppose to act and talk. here two example of why they should be remove from the shelves music and magazines.     first, in deal with music children word immate act they see and the words the say. one good example is rap music: their song have cuss words in them and believe me when i tell you this that i have to constantly to kids at my school saying cuss words like the n- and f-word and many more and seeing some boy's underwear, because they think they are being thugs just because they have their pants sagging low. it drives me crazy and make me think why are their parents letting their children do this. in the next paragraph i will talk about magazines.     second, with magazine some of the images they use on their covers and pages are something that are ment to be seen where children read. an example for this is when i went into my school library's copying room to copy an article from magazine i found a magazine on the table and it show three of the cast members from @location in their birthday suits. i thought what in the world is this doing at my school they should have something like that in a place where kids are in a learning environment. why on earth did they send this to a school for crying out loud. what do they think it want bother any kids' parent about it that i sure would be furious about it if i found out that my child had a something that at there school.     in conclusion, this is why they should be removed from the shelves so the children don't see them.
0.4 dear @organization,     i think that it is wrong to remove offensive and other non offensive books from the shelves in the library just because one or two students do not like them or do not want to see others reading them.           somethings are ok for reading and learning although they are indeed offensive it is ok for these matrerials to be left on the shelves, if it will be used for a good purpose such as learning and not just for fun. it is important for readers to be exposed to a broad spectrum of reading materials. not only should they be exposed to some materials that are not so clean and normal but they should be introduced to things such as foreign writing. if we took everyting off the shelves that was a slight bit offensive or was not completely suited for readers would there be many books that would keep peoples atention?       in conclusion i strongly believe that these materials should be left on the shelf. these materials are important for learning in some cases and keep the readers attention. keep these items on the shelves!
0.4 the censorship in libraries should be as gog as it is for that age group. children of the age @num to @num should be able to read books with any profanity. they should be mature enough to get through a book that has name calling and uses the profanity without laughing or taking it offensive.     children that are @num should not have books in their libraries with much of this pro-found languge. they are young and should not be expecting the fact that there people that use these words to express feeling or name calling. they should be able to hear very little or see very little but when they get older they are suppose to be use to this. if they dont hear it as much then yes i would agree but they should have a point of censorship in the libraries they are in.      with children that are younger than @num years of age they should not read or seee things that have profanity or bad scenes unless their parents let them. we cannot controll what parents lets their children do but we can in the schools and in the public libraries
0.6 if something is to be found offensive, than it should certainly be removed from the shelves. when parents send or take their children to a library, they do not expect their child to be able to pick up something that is not appropriate. some items @month offend someone's beliefs and be rude. public libraries are just that, public. everything there will be seen by the public and large masses of people. no one should have to worry about being offended when they walk into a place of learning and knowledge.     parents do not want their child going to the library and picking up rude materials. even if the child does not check the book or magazine out, who is to stop that young, impressionable mind from flipping through the pages. perhaps he or she reads something that his or her parents did not intend on teaching them for some time. books now have a lot of crude text and humor. if there is a topic that a younger individual is not mature enough to understand, he or she @month get the wrong impression or ideas about the subject.      if a kid is rumaging through the more adult section of the library, they might be expossed to some information they are not ready for. offensive language @month be present in the books and now the young person will see them and try to use the words or phrases. if a child read something about sex, he or she might be curious or confused, and ask their parents about it. the parents on the other hand, might not have wanted their child to know about the topic at such a young age. at that point there would be no turning back. parents would have to explain things that are too mature for some young minds.     parents have every right to deny minors and children certain materials, but if the books are out in open, who will censor what is looked at by whom. libraries need to put serious thought into what is on the shelves, no matter what form the information is in. people @month think just because the story was in a book, than of course it can't be real. some reckless senarios are played out in movies. those movies are watched by people of all ages. if an impressionable teenager watches a movies that has offensive language or violent scenes, that teen might act upon what they've seen.     since the public library is indeed public, the materials it offers to people should not be offensive. all sorts of individuals walk into a library and look around. no one should ever walk out a library with the feeling of being offended. no parent should have to worry about what their child might pick up. libraries should not cause worry or harm in any way.
0.6 every author has an intended audience when they are writing a book, and they write about what they think is appropriate for that certain audience.  unfortunately, sometimes other people that are not intended to read the book actually do read it even though it @month not be something that they are supposed to be reading.  when an author writes a childrens book, it is meant for a child to read, not an adult.  also when an author writes a romance novel, it is meant for people who can comprehend what the authr is talking about and can act maturely while reading it.  although some novels @month not be appropriate for certain people, censorship in libraries is not they way to fix that, and it is a big mistake.     as humans we are given certain freedoms, and one of those freedoms is the freedom of press.  authors should be able to write about whatever they choose to write about.  if they choose to write about subject's that are not appropriate for all age groups they still have the right to have their books in libraries.  even though everyone isn't supposed to read them, certain people are. if you take those books away because your scared that a child might get ahold of one, then your taking away what certain people enjoy reading.     due to the fact that different books are intended for different age groups, libraries have different sections filled with a variety of authors.  they have a children's section made primarily for children,an adult section with books that only adults are supposed to read and a teen section for everyone in between.  by having sections within them, libraries are trying to keep people reading what they were intended to read without censoring or taking away people's favorite books.  having sections in libraries is a happy medium between letting anyone read whatever book they would like no matter how inappropriate it @month be, and cutting out certain books all together.     if a person is an adult, they should be allowed to go to the library and get whatever type of book, magazine, music, or movie that they want.  if a kid's parent is okay with them checking out or looking at certain things then it shouldn't matter to anyone else if they think that the material is offensive.  instead of censoring what movies, books, magazines, or music that libraries have, there should be a certain age when someone can come in without a parent and check out whatever they would like.  if a person is under that age then their parents should be present while they check out so they can approve of what their child is checking out.     censorship in libraries is ultimately pointless and shouldn't even be considered.  whether some people find certain material offensive or not, there are other ways to get that material so there really is no point to censoring anything in libraries
0.6 when have you ever went into a library and found a book that is so offensive that you complain or try to get that certain book off the shelf? have you ever read a book half way through and questioned why you are reading it? why would you read a book that you know you're not going to like?     if someone has the right and the authority to take books off the shelf that bothers them, then i have the exact same right as them. i thought everyone was treated by equal rights. when i ever do read i always read the back of the book or whats called the summary of the story so i can see if i'm going to like it or not. if i know a book is going to offend me or a magazine or even a movie, most likely i'm not going to even bother giving my attention to them.     obviously the author doesnt like censorship or she wouldnt be arguing about it. it's obviously something that bothers her and everyone is intitiled to their own beliefs and disbeliefs. i respect people that stand up for themselves and find the hardest ways out of hard prediciments. i can say i always go to libraries and read books because i'm not a reader. but i can tell you if i ever did go to a library and i found a book on the shelf that offends me its probably going to offend someone else. so why would they even try to bother getting away with being offensive to people. everyone is intitled to their own opinion. but i think if it's going to offend someone in praticular it's probably going to bother someone else. i'm not saying everyone is alike but most people believe in things that other people believe in. people can hav the same agreements and disagreements.     i do have to agree with @person because she is right. you would be amazed on the amount and different things people can get offended by. i have tons of experiences of movies, books, music, and magazines that have offended me. but i didnt let it pull me down or anything. for example i stopped watching the movie, and i stopped reading the book that bothered me. you can't wear your emotions on your shoulders but you can stand up for your rights and tell people what you believe. @caps't ever tell anyone that you can't believe in your opinions. if certain things offend you, @caps't let them bother you just stop doing what your doing and move on to something else.     like i said i have had alot of experiences of offensive things i have read and watched. like awhile back i watched a movie that had a black man in it and he was locked in prison and killed in prison for being accused of something he didn't do. it was just because the time era and it was also because he was black. thats the kind of stuff that really upsets me. because we are all the same. we @month look different and see things different. but our bodies function the same and we all breathe the same air. i have always gone by the saying, '@caps't ever judge a book by it's cover until you read it.'     so whatever people @month think i believe in one thing and it's to let people believe in things they want to believe in. @caps't ever tell someone how to think, act, or feel. i agree with katherine paterson.
0.4 should certain books, movies, magazines, music, etc., should be removed from shelves if they are found to be offensive. books, movies, magazines, music are made to relay a message, express a point of veiw, or to perhaps state an oppionion, of which everyone has a different point of veiw.     no, books, movies, magazines, music, etc., should not be simply taken off of the shelves or out of stores. all of the previously listed things are rated. movies are rated @caps through @caps, books are rated child through adult, and music if explicit has a parental advisery sticker, so just follow the ratings. if a four-year old tried to buy two tickets to see a rated @caps movie the theater would not sell him the tickets because he is not yet off age. people @month bring the point of maybe a child picks up a adult book or magazine in a store and begins to look at it and read it. the solution to that problem is simple create a seperate room in stores that sell these items and label the room adult section. have cameras near by so if a yongster feels brave enough to tempt fate they will be caught or just put a desk out front of the adult section and require an i.d. for entrance. these are still books which are expressions of a persons dreams, hope, desires, fantasies, and heart, they should not be denied there dream because a person deems it unfit. and most apparent if it offends you dont read it.     simply follow the rating rules. take necesary precations. if all of these rules are followed then buisnesses and libraries should have no probles keeping everybody safe and happy.
0.6 censorship in the world we live in today is a very interesting concept. with the advent of social media, we now have thriving communities of people that want their voice to be heard, and people are listening. we now are able to tap into the huge ammount of knowledge from people all around the world, allowing us to see what is really happening in the countries like @location, where media is considered treason. what do we do now that governments are starting to censor the internet? lets start by looking an arguement that has been long talked about: library censorship.     today, it is almost a requirement for cities to have public libraries to be considered as real cities. public libaries, and the funding they require, are not anywhere within the @organization. even so, they have taken a place in our neighborhoods that has made them indefinate sources of knowledge and culture. one public library @month be a source of; historical town records, children's books, novels, research papers, non-fiction books, fiction books, magazines, and many other types of entertainment and knowledge. public libraries are, even with the widespread usage of the internet, important places for us, as residents of a city, to socialize and learn.     libraries today @month carry books that were in the past on the 'banned books' list, but that does not mean books are not being banned from libraries. libaries are generally family institutions, and as being funded by the public, required to adhear by the moral and ethical standards of those who live in the area. this means that there is not one, 'national banned books list', but there many discrepencies througout @location in banning books. as culture moves more and more into more and more questionable materials, libaries are faced with a tough decision; keep up with the times and have more questionable and controversial reading material, or get lost in the past and try to kling onto the senior generation to stay alive.     bringing new literary materials into the library that is fresh and new means that more people will return to the library again, be it young-adults or older adults trying to get in touch with the current world. one major controversy of books in public libaries are the inclusion of sexual intimacy. as a new generation sprouts, fed with music lyrics by such names as; '@organization', or '@organization', we enter a new age where younger and younger kids are learning about sex. the authors of today have recognised this and have started to include references to sexual intimacy, but not detailed encoutners. i believe this is fine, because as we move on in generations we are going to find out that education about sex; safe sex, birth control, @caps prevention and testing, is much more important than trying to keep children ignorant. keeping these young adults involved in books and trying to continue their learning outside of school is a much larger issue we should be trying to tackle instead of trying to create silly arguments against new reading material in a public libary.     public libaries are the centerpiece for learning outside of school in many communities, small and large. knowing this, how could anyone truly believe that it would be smart to stop including new books that would entice new patrons? even as a commercial buisness, this would make no sense, simply turning people away because you have a single view of what the future is and you refuse to listen to anyone else's opinion of the future. so why is there a question on including new knowledge? isn't it obivous that we, as a nation, should show the world that we aren't living in the past. that we are indeed the future of the world, and that our young-adults will recieve the best education in the world by not only learning in schools, but by being the most active readers, and by extension, learners in the world.
0.4 do i think materials, such as books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from the book shelve if they found offensive? yes i do beause why keep it on ther if it's offensive to young kids and other people.     if it dosen't have nothing do with learning then it shouldn't be on ther. its sertin things kids should read so if they want to put materials that are made for adults then they should put it in a sepreat section from the kids section.     they shouldn't have any music or movies that have some type of violents in it because the kids now days have to much violents as it is.the only way they should put music or movies on there is if they have learning materials in it.     so i think you should put books, music, movies, and magazines on the shelve only if they contain learning maertails and things that would persuad them to do some in they life.
0.4 censorship in libraries in my view isn't a good idea. library now days have alot of offensive language in there books so if someone were to take all of the book like that out of the library then library wouldn't even have that many books in it. music is the same way all music now days might have some offensve words in them thats just something people now days have to get over.          i think library censorship is not a good idea. some parent might not like the idea of there librarys haveing offensive language in the books, music, movies, and magazines. if the parent don't want there children to not read those book then they need to chose there childrens book, but i think takeing all the offensive book of the shelves isn't very smart. some people enjoy reading and listening to that kind of music.           some of the best books, and music now days have bad stuff in then like drugs, language, sex, gangs and much more but sometimes books like that can teach you a lesson on how to avoid that going down the road. so if you take those books off the shelves and werent able to listen to that music maybe your child could do some of those things. they really wouldnt know the side effects and bad thing that could come out of those things. some of the top music and books have offensive materials in then and why would you not let your kid read them because of a couple choice word in them.i know some of this material could be bad for people but sometimes it can teach you a huge lesson in your life.     if there are book you dont want youself to read then don't read them. i think it would be unfair to take everthing that have some bad language or maybe some racism away from us just because you don't think its good for your child to read. its not fair to people who @month enjoy those books to not have the luxary to read those book anymore cause a few parent got mad about a book. some of the old books have alot of racism in them, and you actually @month read some of them in a school for a class. those book @month also have bad language in them to. take thing those books away from us @month take away are education, and we won't be able to learn from those books like we should.          so i think that censorshipn in library is just a horrible idea. it can take away from lesson we could learn and are education that we need to be successful in life
0.6 why censorship @caps @caps?     in our everyday lives, we come across many things that can be taken to offense.  some of these things we might not even realize, but they're out there.  everybody doesn't want there children getting into the wrong things early on, but we know it will eventually happen.  we just have to teach our kids what @caps good and what @caps @caps.  this goes for literary items too.  we need to have faith in our kids that they will do what @caps right.  i think that when old enough, they should be able to read books and listen to music that might be offensive.  i think we shouldn't get rid of all the offensive material at the libraries.     now days, there @caps a lot of hard work that goes into music, movies, and books.  if we start getting rid of all the offensive material, many people will be offended that in itself.  the people that worked on the movie or wrote that book put a lot of time and effort into the piece.  they spent countless of hours working with others just to get the piece into publication, or trying to get somone to film their movie idea.  i think that it would be wrong to outrule peices of great literature because behind every one of them, there @caps a person that put a lot of effort into that material.     in every book you pick up today, you could look through it and find a offensive language or offensive gestures in it.  the @caps @caps @caps @caps a very detailed book and has many great facts in it, but many people find it offensive because it says @person had a wife and had children.  this book isn't telling you what to believe or what actually happened, it @caps just a story full of conspiracy theories.  you can still believe what you want and read this book.  a movie that could be considered offensive just by the title @caps @caps @caps can't @caps.  many people hear this title and @month not want to watch it, thinking that it will discriminant against @caps people, but instead it @caps a very good movie about a group of people that play basketball.  many things have offensive language but that doesn't mean we can't act like adults, read these books, and realize that they are just stories.  they are not telling you what to believe and what not to believe.     in our country today, we have many different ethnic groups, and many people think differently about things.  in our society we are given the right to have our own opinion about things, and we are able to like what ever we want.  even though literary might be offensive, some people like reading books like this.  if i look in the library, i could find a book with offensive material, but the book could still be a very good book.  even though it @caps disrcimanting against me, i could still love the book.  there @caps always controversy in our society, and almost everyone loves it.  why get rid of these books when people are still enjoying them everyday.     like katherine paterson said, if she has the right to take a book off of the shelf, then so does everyone else.  if we let everybody take books off the shelves, then there will be none left.  we cannot control everything that people do.  taking offensive books out of the library will not stop people from reading them, but this will decline the library usage, and people will slowly stop reading.  if they don't like the books at the library, then they won't have problem with not reading at all.  i think that censorship in our libraries would be a @caps idea, and i think we should definitely not take out all the offensive material in the libraries
0.0 yes i thinck they should take efence books off the shelf because little likd read the books then they will probley be tought rong from right. and if the books had vilance then they will thinck tkat is right to.
0.2 i think as long as the book ain't offensive or bad then people should keep reading it. if its offensive i think they shouln't read it at all cause it would not be right to read such a thing. also i think if there is bad music it should be taken off the shelves. parents or teachers wouldn't want there kids finding out bad words to say
0.6 typically when you walk in to a library there are books, magazines, movies, and cds everywhere. most of the items in the library are appropriate for children, but some are for adults and teenagers. many people struggle with the fact that there are items in the library that are offensive to religion, have offensive language in them, or contain adult materials. in this country we have a freedom of speech and a freedom of religion which allows us to choose things that we feel are correct in certain situations such as this one.     true, there are books out there that are very offensive to certain types and religions of different people. have you ever seen or heard of a movie that was educational yet offensive? in my opinon people should have the right to censor what the library provides for their student or child, to a certain extent. if a book or magazine or whatever it @month be is offensive to someone, i believe that they should be able to choose if their student or child gets to look at that certain item. people should not take this censorship ability out of hand.     i believe that our generation is much different from ones in the past because most of the things we have to deal with are things that are most likely offensive to a certain religion and or type of person. which in a sense is hurting the censorship of all the people who choose to take part in it. i believe that a person or authority figure at the moment should be able to take a book off the shelf if and only if they request it to the library and they approve of it.      people have the right to do what they choose, but taking away other peoples chances to read a book, or check out a movie is going a little far with that censorship privalige. i think that when a person feels that an item in the library is offensive they should have to sign a piece of paper stating why they think it should be taken out of the library and the people you believe it is offensive towards. in doing so i believe that only that certain item should be taken away from that certain group of people.      all in all i believe that the censorship in libraries is a spectacular idea because of all the bad things in the world that come out in books, movies, and cds. people have the right to change things if they believe they are wrong. they should jump at the chance if it comes to a point where they can change things for the better! do you believe that censorship in libraries is a good idea? i do, because it gives people to oportunity to change and make things better for themselves if they believe something is offensive.
0.6 there are thousands of libraries throughout the world. all of which are filled with numberous books, magazines, music, movies, ect. for people of all ages to obtain. some people think that materials in a library should be censored while others think everything should be allowed to be there. i do not think materials at a library should be removed, or censored, because the materials would decrease, people would choose what to look at, and the material would help with research.     materials at libraries should not be censored because the materials allowed at the libraries would decrease. everyone has different opinions on what they think is appropiate or not. if one person were to decide a book was unappropiate and take it off the shelf, another person would have the right to take another book that they thought was unappropiate off the shelf as well. however, since everyone has different beliefs on what is appropiate and what is not, the books would rapidly decrease.the same would apply to the other items at the libraries such as magazines, movies, ect.     another reason is because everyone has their own choice about what they want to look at in a library. a fifty year old man would not have the same intrests as a thirteen year old girl, so if some materials were removed, there would not be as much of a variety to chose from. if there is a little variety to chose from due to materials being censored, the amount of people using the library would decrease causing the library to eventually get shut down from the lack of people using it.      lastly, materials at a library should not be censored because each and every item there could help with some kind of research. a child from high school could go to the library to look for a book to help research things for a report in one of their classes, or an elder women could go to the library in search of a cookbook to research something new to make for her next home cooked meal. both people would need a material from the library to help them with their reasearch, but if some materials at the library were removed, they might not be able to find something to help them.     materials at a library should not be censored because the materials would decrease, people would choose what to look at, and the material would help with research. some people believe removing items at a library should be allowed, but i strongly disagree. there are many different materials in the libraries around the world today for people of all ages to come in contact with, and that is the way it should stay
0.4 have you ever got or check out a book or something that has been racial to you or you think it should have been censored? i haven't but i checked out a book before that had a lot of racism in it and sex. im not racist but some people are very racist. some of the book in libraries aren't sutible for some viewers but yet again the can check it out, some books, movies, magazings, and others should be taking in consideration on being removed so some viewers can't read them.     in libraries there are book that have alot of racism in them. some racism gets to be very bad in the book and it could intrest and provoke the young viewer to go down that road in a later life. which could be very bad if you think about it. he could talk his friends into becoming what he is. talk them into becoming racist towards others. no mother or father wants their kids to be racist, but there are familys that are racist. which i don't get because we are all the same to me.      in some books in the library there is sex talk that accores in it. sometimes the sex talk gets into great detail which isn't sutible for young viewers, because they could get the idea that they want to try that with someone of a different genger. which is okay if ur older but if ur really young and reading a book with sex talk in it. well that's wrong because young kids shouldn't be introduced to that kind of life stile till later in life. some parents wouldn't like their kids to read that kind of book. i know i won't let me kid read a book like that.      music is something that everyone listens to, no matter is its rap, country, or the blues. certain people like certain kind of music. some people think that rap music is offensive and should be removed off the shelves. well rap music is based on their past and how their life is. it does have some racism in it like certian rappers say bad words that aren't really sutible for young viewers.      although some of the racism and cencorship that should be cencored are on shelves, i think it should be in a separete room so only older people can check it out or buy it, instead of the young kids getting a hold of it. i believe that books should have racism in it because it shows how much we have changed from the past
0.6 there is a certain amount of responsibility when it comes to censoring all the different types of media and literature. deciding whose responsibility that is can be a difficult task. children can be strongly influenced by all media out there and making that material has been made easily accessible. when someone comes of age to make decisions that affect their life then they should be able to. shop owners should be able to sell whatever they want in order to make a living.     when children go to a library usually they will not do so alone. parents can decide what their child is allowed to take home or not. when a child comes to their parent with a book, movie, or magazine that is offensive or inappropriate it comes to the parent to decide whether or not they want their child to be exposed to that material. if the parent allowed for their child to have access to offensive media then that can give the child the idea that what they are looking at or reading is alright.      if someone has come of age and has all the other freedoms that everyone else has they should be allowed to buy, read, and watch what they want. to prove to someone that you are of age to have access to offensive material you should have to show some sort of identification proving it.      a shop owner or businessman/woman should be able to sell whatever he or she wants to in order to make a living as long as it stays within the boundaries of the law. having someone who does not work in the law or a person who is not a legal guardian or parent of someone who is not of age should not tell someone not to buy, read, or watch something just because it might be offensive or offend that one person.     i conclude that in order for a someone to tell another person not to buy or rent material that person would either have to be law enforcement or their legal guardian as long as they are not of age. there is no reason why people should not be able to access material that is not against the law. if someone is offended by some literature then they should try to make it against the law.
0.4 dear @caps @person,           should certain books be removed because some people @month think they are inappropriate for their children to see or read? no, i do not think they should be removed. i honestly think all they all should be put in different sections of the library by age.      like all the children books and magizenes should be in one section. the younge adult and or teen books and magizenes should be in a section by its self. then the adult books and magizenes should be in their own section. even the autobiographys and documentories should be in their own section too.      it would make things easier to find the book you are wanting to read. for example, if your a teenage girl looking for a book about a high school girl with a crush on a boy, it'd most likely be in the section for the younge adults.      so yes, the parents that are concerned about their children's viewing of certain books should be able to say something about it. but what if one teenager is looking for a book about a famous person's autobiography for a school project. even though it includes how they used to be into drugs as a teenager. that person shouldn't have to fail if they can't find it in a library because some concerned parent didn't think it was appropriate.     like i said the best thing to do is put all the books in subcatagories by age. it would make things was easier and faster to find the book of your selection
0.6 censorship in the world is getting worse everyday. many people believe that some material is unsuitable. i believe that if it is unsuitable for others does not make it unsuitable for some. i believe people have the right to read,watch, or listen to what they want as long as it is not breaking any laws. i am torn on this topic because i am against censorship, but i am also for it when laws are being broken.     i believe that people should have the right to read whatever they want. granted, some people read very incriminating books that could get them in a lot of trouble, but not everyone should be punished for another persons mistake. sometimes you hear about terrorist groups and other illegal groups, but usually they do not market to everyday people. i think that when it becomes a threat to the @location they should remove material.     another simple fact is that the constitution @location that we have the freedom of @caps, which basically means we @month print and read whatever we want. many people depend on the constitution to make their lives seem safer and sometimes there is a book,article, movie, or a song that goes beyond our limits. i believe that some people use materials wrongly sometimes to get ahead and to make a name for themselves. i just think that people should write for the pure joy of it, not to persuade people to do something bad,or give bad thoughts or ideas.     the government has the right to control what we partake in, but does that seem fair? i understand thier logic behind this matter, but just because it has offensive matter does not mean they should remove it from society. i believe that if people want to experience it they should be able to without wondering if it will gone the next day. if people do not agree with this 'offensive' matter, then they should not take part in it. this is a true enough statement that it just makes you wonder about their logic.     so, does the government have the right to say what we can and cannot read? i don't believe so, but that is my opinion. i believe that people should read whatever they so choose to and should not think they are breaking laws for some 'offensive' material. freedom of the @caps is what people have to look up to for the government, but how are people supposed to feel secure when they are reading a book, watching a movie, or listening to music that @month be assumed 'offensive'.
0.2 yes because children should not be reading anything thats is like that. children snhould be reading a book that haves good information in there and information the children should be learning while they are in class. well if the books, music and other stuff to read and look have bad stuff in it should be removed from the shelf because children should not be looking at it. some music has bad language in it and children should not be listening to music like that. also movies that have inapproriate scenes in it should be watched by children becaus eits not good for the children to see all that and parents should do something about if their children is watching movies with inapprroiate scenes in it and magazines that have inapproiate pictures because children are too young to see that.
0.2 my thoughts on censorship in libraries is yes some books, music, movies, magazines, and etc., should be taken off of the shelves if they are offensive. if they are left on the shelves some very small child or teens could come up and reach for a book and find that it has bad things in it that are ment for adults. the child will ask the caregiver that they are with '@caps does this picture mean?', and they will most likely not know @caps to say at that moment. parents and caregivers are not always up to explaining or want to explain as soon as they have to about things sometimes. everyone goes through life with different things they have to learn at different rates. somethings should be taught when we young like how to brush our teeth, but somethings should be left until we are older like having babies or drinking.           when parents going through the explaination of something like making babies you do not want it to be when they are only five years old. with books in a library with pictures of men and women questions like that do get asked to young. libraries are public places and should be safe for any age no matter whether they are young babies or adults. public schools have libraries in them also, and i would not want a child reading a @caps or @caps book with bad or offensive things in it. it does not just have to be a book with bad things in it, but it could also be something to do with religions. everyone has their thoughts and comments on at least one religion. if you have grown up a @caps your whole life, and a kid picks up a book dealing with jews they will ask someone about it.      young kids and teens can always find things that they should notat certain ages, but why not make it less by not letting a library be censorshiped? when you were younger your parent did not want to take you to the library and be asked an offensive question because of a book, music, movie, or magazine. it has worked for so many years, so we should not have to change it now.
0.4 people see libraries as a good place for knowlodge and just an information place, many people like them and some dread of the fact of hearing the word, '@caps'. to be honust i only know a handful of people who use libraries in my life as a source for information now days but; can some information from libraries be offencive to others? the answer is based by your own opinion to be quite honust, but yes i think some iformation that can be picked up from your local @caps can be rather, disturbing 'per say'.  theres books and information that you wish you would have never picked up in your whole life, then again thats everywhere.     now music and movies etc. is sort of the same way, some @month not agree with what he/she picks out and you know they might be interested in. can it be offencive to people? the answer is of coarse it can, but because people will be people. you @month not agree on something, but your friend might think entirely different from what you are thinking, everyone is titled to their opinion on anything, well normally. now if they have graphic movies or explicit music on the shelf where your little son/daughter can just grab, i could see that as a major issue.     some parents do not want their children listening to that music at such a young age, even though the way things are in america your child will hear or see those things, it's life. if that is the case where a five year old can pull a graphic movie or a cd that a parent doesn't want them to see or hear, then i do'nt nessasarily think it should be banned from the @caps. i believe it should be handled well mannered and it should be moved, to a not so easy reach to a five year old. these are common arguements people have, about many places and about simular disagreements.      yes, i agree some things found in a @caps can be found offencive to some but my answer stays as, 'no' it shouldn't be removed unless it really is that offencive. if there is something that offencive in the @caps and mutiple people find it offencive in the community, i would take it to the people in charge of the local @caps
0.6 libraies should not be able to remove books, movies, and  magizines off the shelves just because some kids might be offended. if the town libraries and school libraries took out the cool movies, magizines, and books that most kids love to read and watch then the kids that like those books , movies, and magizines would not return to the library any more.           for example, i like to listen to hard rock, heavy metal, and rap. but, the people that go to church just like to listen to church music. if your with your friend one night because he invited you to come to church with him and you pull in the parking lot listening to your rap music some people @month not like it. this doesn't mean that they should take the things people don't like off the shelves in order to satisfy them.          libraries should have a policy stating that if a child should check out a book or magizine or rent a movie, that they should have the childs parents sign and return a permission slip stating that their child has their permission to rent this book, magizine, or movie. libraries should have an age limint to check out books and magizines. if kids would want to rent a movie then they would have to have a permission slip signed by their parents and returned. this permission slip will and can be used for all movies.           libraries should not remove their books, magizines, or movies. they should make a policy to allow older kids to check them out. so, library material should be a choice
0.6 censorship is important. especially pertaining to what books, magazines, movies, and music almost all people are reading, watching, and listening to. some of the media such as books and magazines and such in libraries everywhere can be highly offensive to certain people or can send off the wrong message to children and teens. so, should we take them off the shelves?     i personally think no, most media aspects that are on the shelves in libraries can be very offensive to people, but alot of it has to do with people's opinions. the readers are the ones that are claiming that the books and other media aspects in libraries are offensive. the authors and directors and singers just do what they do, and the judgement and opinions all come from the people, fans, and critics. we shouldn't be taking it all off library shelves just because it is offensive to some people.     this leads back to the quote from katherine paterson when she states: 'and then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' we can't take everything off the shelves because everyone's opinions are different so if we censor everything, there won't be anything left. right now, they are doing a good job with censoring everything such as putting a rating on video games, and movies. rated @caps movies are known to be for adult watchers and same goes for video games. music they play on the radio is censored of all the foul language, so they make an effort. that leaves people the choice to watch, listen, or read the things they want, and they have to know beforehand that it might offend them. although sometimes people think censoring those media aspects is not enough censorship, that's about all that can be done to not offend others. by taking everything off the shelves because of people's opinions, it could potentially make someone else angry or them being lacked of the things they want to read or watch. censorship can be wholesome without removing all media off the shelves and in the world
0.6 isn't  it shocking that some books, music, movies and magazines you find on your library shelf today aren't appropriate for the little ones. i believe that if you have to question whether a child should be listening or viewing this item then it shouldn't be in or around a child section at all. some content could be offensive to not just children but also to teenagers and adults.      some music @month contain words that are children shouldn't be exposed to. music such as hip/hop and rap @month contain degrading comments to men and/or women. i wouldn't want my child listening to this type of music, or reading any book that talks about it. music @month also be offensive to cultures, religion, sexual orientation and race. books or music with comments such as that should have notes written on them stating what they contain. i was reading a book called '@caps of @caps', that i had picked up in the child section. after the first chapter i had wondered who who call this a children book. the character was using profanity and talking about sex the whole time. my child shouldn't be looking for a book on pie then find out its not about pie.     i once was watching a movie with my two year old that we got from the library. the movie was full of inappropriate words, therefore i had to shut it off. movies like that should not be on the shelf at the library for my child to view. i now have to worry about what we check out. i also have had a few bad reading experiences. magazines is a big one. some magazines @month contain content such as innappropriate pictures and words. magazines should stay at the grocery store rather then a library that i take my child to.     books, music, movies and magazines should stay out of the childrens section if they are only meant for adult viewing keep them in the adult section. any parent would tell you that they don't agree with some of the stuff on your local library shelf today. offendsive content shouldn't be found in the library at all. i know now to keep a better eye on what my child is reading.
0.4 first of all, do you believe that certain materials, such as books, music, magazined, etc, should be remove from the shelves if they are found offensive, thats question should not be ask ever in life.      why beacuse there are many people out there that read read stuff and listen to stuff that you might not like at all. when i first saw this question i answer to my self that, ''that if all people think the same way this world would be boring, and i answer the question by saying that there should not be any books remove or music remove, from any shelves' why beacause we all don tlike the same thing or do the same thing.     in first place, i know that there are many different kind of thing that people beacause they love doing it and some dont do those kind of things beacause they really dont like or dont care about it. this is answering the question about removing books, music, or magazines from shelves even if the article the book, music, etc, say's or if its offensive to other people, that is not a reason to remove stuff. there are thing that you enjoy doing and things that you emjoy reading, listening, and looking, etc that other people dont like or hate about it.     in second place, not only beacause you dont like something people should stop doing those things or stop buying those thing, no!!, that is not the case here @caps. or @caps. you should not care just for you or do what ever is right for you. if you are a good person that wants to be someone in the future dont just care about you care about the other too, beacause you'll need those person or those book in the future when ever your falling down.     in my conclusion, about this article. i think that people should not remove any thing from any library even if its found offensive to other people, those thing help other in life to do what they really want to do, while other are getting hurt for those offensive this that are writting on a little peace of paper. hope this latter help you all think about and change your decision about this case, hope you all make the right decision that would not affect anyone in general.     thank you for taking your time to ready what i really think about removing articles from libraries
0.4 i think that there are some books out there that really do need to be taken on the library shelves and just be put in book stores for ones own useage. then there are other books that people just need to be more mature about like history books talking about wars, slavrey and books with curse words in them.      school libraries such as the elementry and high school should have books according to their age groups. if the libririan knows the book is not something a young kid should read then they shouldnt let them check it out. the music,magazines and movies should also be age appropiate for the age groups too little children do not need to hear cuss words every five seconds in a song.      movies should be age appropiate too. thats why libraries have sections for babys,toddlers,pre teens, teens and adults so if your really concerned that your child or even just your self are gonna find a offensive book or one thats not good for the age group then stay ing your own section. lets say your a teen and theres a book that is not right for you too read and is for more older people then you should be able to tell a librarian that is there and maybe she can just move it out of that section.          every person feels differently about whats offensive and not  offensive though so libraries shouldnt have to take out every book that offends one person cause it's not fair to the rest of the people. besides no ones making you check out that book
0.6 sometimes i think its always good to have an anappropiate material on the shelves of stores or a library. i feel this way because of when you see stuff that is offensive, most people are willing to buy. or maybe when you been through rough times in your life, people like to read books that can be offensive be cause it was a reflection of the way they've been brought up.         my views on censorhip contain to keep the offensive materials because its what people like best. music, magazines, books, and movies. all of these materials can entertain adults, and teenagers because of the anappropiate sayings. it seems to give people to boost up their style and ways to act, such as music as the number one offensive material. music comes from everywhere around the world, where young teens adapt to that kind of music and starts to feel that anapprpiate vibe.          another reason my views on censorship contain to keep the offensive materials is because of what we see and watch. movies and television. when we watch a movie thats is offensive and that can be very anappropiate, you learn from whats in the movie. most people make movies that can teach lessons if your willing to follow behind, or some movies contain advice for people that are going for the wrong things in life. thats one of my main reasons i think the newspaper should keep offensive movies in stores. television is basically the same for movies. you can learn a lot from a offensive @caps show, you can learn what and what not to do.          also my views on censorship contain to keep the offensive materials of what we read, books; books are entertainment and what most of us like to do when we have free time off our hands. people seem to read books because of the catorgories that most likely are to fit the way they are, such as reflections of peoples lifes, rough, lovely, funny and drama. we attend to read these offensive books because of what some of us been through as a kid or just would like to read it because they wanna maybe feel the same sympothy that some one else @month have had. also books can be adviceful of ehat people want to do in life, careers that you @month be intersted in.     last but not least on my views on censorship contain to keep the offensive materials like magazines. magazines are the least offensive object that is placed on a shelf. i go against the reason of magazines to be on the shelf because its alot of gossip. i believe gossip is one of the main reasons why most people buy magazines. also because of the false information. the false information that that give, is what we wanna buy. but for the most part of my oppinion, i believe that this material should not be in the store unless they change it up.     i believe the offensive materials music, movies, books, and some what of magazines should be on the shelves of stores because lots of people are willing to buy. they all catch eyes for gossip, provokinding adds
0.0 i think that we should censor things our children read and look at in the libraries.they are young eyes and they are to young to be looking at that stuff.they would be taught the wrong thing at a very young age.they would grow up the wrong way.we need to take a stand on what are kids look at.fr the future we need censorship.please everyone take a stand
0.2 dear @caps @caps,          i think that if a book is on a shelf the book should be taken off if found offensive. people at libraries fight over a book. they need to have more than one copy of a book if they fight over one book. if the library dosen't have more than one copy of a book it will create a lot of prolums for everyone.          people in library fight over a sigle book. i think who ever gets there first should get the book, but that just me. if two people fight over a book they should be kicked out of the library and never come back to the library. and that is why we have fights over a book. the next time you are in a library think frist before you act. ask yourself '@caps they get ther before me?'.          the library should have more that one copy of a book. lets say '@organization @organization' book sreies is in the library and thay have one of each book. now the lat move of '@organization' is coming out this @date (@date) and people what the last book to read. the kids what it, but there is one book. so what do you do? get more copies of the book. this is why libraries should have more than one copy.          if the libraries don't have more than one copy of a book it will create a lot of prolums. if they have one copy of a book it will begin fights. you don't what to fight in a library (look @caps @num). now if it was me, i will let someone have it that whan it. so, libraries need more than one copy.     in conclusion i think that if a book is on a shelf, the book should be taken off if found offensive. there fighting for a book and you don't whant that. the libraries needs more than one copy of a book, so they will not fight over it. if the libraries don't have copies of a book it will create prolums. so, think before yo act. it can be found offensive at time.                                                                           sincesly,                                                                         @person
0.4 i think that most books, magazines or any kind of reading material that has offensive stuff to people are ok. many people needs to read them and see what they are about. i think people take little things such as, curse words, or if the book or magizine is talking about drugs people take offensve.          i don't think there is one book out there that doesn't have a curse word in it. many people complain about small things like that when the reading material could be a lot worse than it is. i have read many books that have inappropriate words in them.     i had a situation once when the title of the book sounded great and when i started reading it it had a lot of curse words in it. i guess thats just how it is now a days. you honestly cannot find a book without atleast one bad word in it. people just need to learn to get over the fact that many offensive things are found in many different reading materials.     i do not think that the books, music, movie, magizines etc. should be removed from the shelves. it could be interesting to someone else but not you. many people have different oppinions about different kinds of things and i think it should just be left up to that person weather or not they read, listen or even look at certain kind of reading material.
0.6 throughout the world, there are thousands of people with various opinions. if one person thinks an art piece looks unique, another @month not see any true beauty. but when people hardly underdstand the concept of other people, they should not be exposed to books or movies that could be defined as offensive. some people don't know @caps it is like to be truely offended.       when i was in middle school, i was a shy, fragile, young girl. i had just moved to a new school and was petrified of my new surroundings. for the first couple of weeks, i felt like an outcast; like an outsider looking in. i didn't fit in with anyones' group. everyone seemed to of already have friends for years and here i was, a new student with no friends to communicate with. i was isolated and was desperately trying to find someone to be my friend. i wondered if something was wrong with me; if i has a bad odor or was dressed in an out of style fashion. i tried buying new clothes and changing my hair color. it seemed as if i wasn't even noticed. before i new it, school was half way over. i was still a nobody. then @person came along and made me a somebody.     @person, who had just moved to my school, looked bold and confident. at first, people waved a friendly hello but nothing more. as i sat at my empty lunch table, @person approached me and asked to sit down. i couldn't refuse the offer so i nodded a sincere yes. the entire lunch period, we sat talking. we had a lot in common and i was glad to have made a friendship with @person. months went by before i realized @person and i were great friends. i knew i could trust him with all of my secrets. even though @person and i were close, i felt as though @caps was always hiding something. occasionally i would have enough courage to ask if there was anything @caps needed to tell me, but as the same as every answer before, it was a no.      @person and i had always walked to my house after school. but on one afternoon, something felt wrong. the air seemed to lingere for miles. we didn't talk until we got inside my house. suddenly @person spoke and said, '@caps are people so cruel?' i was shocked by this question for i didn't know how to respond. @person sensed that i had no clue @caps @caps was talking about so @caps continued. 'i'm gay.' i was appalled. not because @caps was gay, but because @caps had never told me. i asked, '@caps happened?' @caps sat on the couch then and told me about how @caps was in the library overhearing some of our classmates reading a book about people making fun of gays'. i felt awful for @person. it wasn't his fault @caps was gay.     i believe that certain books, movies, or music that are offensive to people should not be aloud on shelves. some have never been offended. some, always offend people for many reasons. everyone has feelings and it hurts when they are offended. we, as a community, should love one another and respect them. not read or listen to things that can hurt someones' inner feelings
0.0 i believe that in libraries certain materials should not be removed from the shelves even if it is offensive because if someone does not like that particular item they could always go and get another item. i have been to a library and nothing at all was offensive to me or anyone else. if you dont like that the library displays all the 'offensive' items then you dont have to go it is an personal choice. everyone has their own choice on what they listion to or read it doesnt matter as long as that particular person likes that sort of thing. that is what i believe in
0.4 with new things coming out these days, i, @person, believe that all things out in libraries should have a certain organization for certian subjects. i am not asking for any removal or destorying of books, magazines, or anything that is in the libraries but i am asking for a fair hearing of my opinion.     i would like more organization for certian things, i do know people have their own ideas about things that should be in a book. these books found in a library could bring enjoyment to people, but sometimes can offence other people.  so, with this way i would really like if there was a scale, or organization of books.      so with that, people who dont like certain subjects could easily stay away from the books that they do not like. if there is a scale factor of these books, music, magazines, or movies, you can just have a number or a letter symbolizing the certain catagories. even though, i, personally think it is alittle worse than a different organization, it would atleast worn people of these things.     if you were to deside that either way would be better so then less complaining people would be wanting all books destroyed. i think that organizing the books in a different way would be better. this would be a lot of work but, thinking of a mother of a child could easily keep them away from books the mother would not even touch herself.     i would not like any books removed from libraries. this is because if you start taking one out of the library, that my offence someone, i believe you will start taking out more than one. with this thought i think it will come down to either everyone complaining about a certain book in the library to no library at all. so please, please think about organizing the books, magazes, movies, music, and more so then this will not happen in the future. thank you for your time to read this, i hope you can find a way of going in to this subject more. also, maybe publish some too, into the newspaper.
0.6 the material that someone people believe shouln't be viewed by childern, i don't believe should be removed from the library shelves just for that reason.     the library is not just for the children but also for the adults. children are exposed to many things everyday that are not suited for them, whether it be in their home, at school, or even while their out in public. so why alter the library just for the children, when we don't even alter the public for them? i think if having certain material that isn't suitable for certain ages, then the children should be monitored closely on what they are pulling from shelves. by pulling something from a shelf just because a parent doesn't want their child to see, hear, or watch it, isn't right to the older people that come to the library.     another reason i don't agree with removing things is because, by removing items that are not suited for a child is like saying we should move the childrens things off of shelves, because the adults have no use for them. their are always many ways to suit both the needs of a child and the needs of an adult in a library, and still keep the children from what they shouldn't read. most children are so amused by their own materials in the library they are not worried about the adult things. if everything a parent didn't want their child to see ws pulled from the selves, then there would be no use for the older people to come to the library. their only custmors left would be the children, and that wouldn't be much business, because the parent's wouldn't want to stay because they wouldn't have anything to entertain them for the toe being.     there are always ways to make both side of the situatation fair. i just don't believe removing material not suited for children is the right thing to do.
0.2 do you think books, magazines, or movies that are offensive  should be removed from the shelves stores and libraries?    in my opion, i think that the boss or manager of the stores should removed the books, magazines, or movies from the shelves stores and libraries that are offensive to adults and kids.      today i will inform you @num reasons why boss or managers should removed books, magazines, or movies from the shelves of stores and libraries that are offensive to some people and kids.     one reason, why the boss and managers should removed books, magazines, or movies from the shelves stores and libraries is that some times kids go the stores and when the parents are about to pay what they are going to buy kids always get a magazine or a book and start reading it and probaly the magazine or the book have something nasty or inappropriate for kids and they  should not be looking at and the parents do not but attention to what their kids are looking.     another reason, why the boss and managers should removed the books, magazines, or movies from the shelves of the stores and labraries is that for some people when they look at the magazines or books front cover and they see a picture from their culture or traditions and the people who did the magazine or the book wrote someting about thier culture or tradition that the person thinks that was not right or might not be true what they wrote about their culture or tradition and the person might get mad or insulted about what they read about their culture or tradition.my last reason why boss or managers should removed the books, magazines or movies from the shelves stores and libraries is that when i go to labraries and i see this little kids waching at the books or magazines and the magazines look nasty or inappropriate i get questinable and in my mind i said 'why the boss or mangers don't removed the books or magazines from the shelves if they look nasty or  inappropriate and that might be something  bad to show them. if the libraries should be good for kids/teenagers and adults for study  in the libraries they should not have offensive books or magazines.in conclusion, i think that the boss or manager of stores or libraries should removed the books, magazines, or movies from the shelves stores and libraries  because they might be offensive to some people and more for their kids. i all ready explind my reason why the boss and manager should removed the books or magazines from the shelves stores and libraries
0.6 i think they should remeove it if the publick thinks its offensive. i think it should be that way about every thing. if something is offending you then you should say something about it. im not saying that it will be takin care of all the time but you might get lucky and someone might fix it so your not offened all the time.      growing up at home dad would always tell me if i didn't like something then don't do it, unless it was somethin that had to be done then i would have to do it. so when something happens that i don't like, i either change my ways or i aviode whatever it is. i rairly change my ways though. some times that is a bad thing though, but who hasn't mad a mistake or two?      this is really hard for me to right about beacuse i don't care what other people think. so i really don't get offened. i do know some people the get offened easy though. i try to stay away from them beacuse you have to watch what you say all the time. to me thats no fun, i mean come on dude you have to be able to take a joke. if more people were easy going then i wouldn't be writing this essa. i bet there would be a lot less droma to but i dont know.     if you know of a book, movie, anything that will or might offened you, just dont read it again. it might not offened the next reader. they might really like the book or whatever it is. all you have to do is stay away from what ever it is that is bothering you. after a wile you will forget about it. i guess if it really really bothered you, and there was a lot more people that felt the same way about the same thing then yes remove it. if there is only a hand full of people saying they are offened then i would just tell them sorry but more people like it better so it will stay.
0.6 there are many materials in libraries that are offcensive to certain people. i don't think they should be taken off the shelves but i do believe they should be put into a different section in the library.      almost every thing in life offends someone in one way or another. it @month be as little as 'blonde jokes' or as major as saying something about someone's sexuallity. i know little kids wouldnt understand those types of things but parents can't keep their kids hidden away forever.     if someone says something about someone else, then i do believe it's wrong. i mean think about how many 'blonde jokes' there are. a lot of blondes i know, don't take those jokes seriously. one of my good friends is a natural blonde and she is probably the smartest blonde i have ever met. whenever she hears a blonde joke she laughs and say something funny to go with it.    probably one of the most major things that people get offended by is politics or someones sexuallity. politics create huge problems for people who don't think something should be one way and then if the governer turns around and says something and someone else will take it way to serious. many people who have are different because they dont like who they are 'suppose' to like are always offended by someone in some shape or form. it's not like parents can keep us away from it forever. little kids become teenagers, teenagers because young adults who eventually become adults. people should learn how to deal with different struggles in life.      so in conclusion, if a parent doesn't want to expose their child to things they thing is offensive then good for them but other people like to learn about the things that people find offensive and that create problems in the @location. i believe that by leaving the books, movies and magazines on the shelves in a seperate area of the library isn't a bad idea. think about it, if you take books away from people who want to learn about the different things and want to know why people get offended, wouldn't they feel offended too because you took that away from them
0.6 who is to label a book offensive? what one might find appauling, others @month find a novel or passage to be rather interesting. all books and other arts were created to be read and enjoyed by people. libraries banning books, music, movies, or magazines seems unreasonable since there is such a wide variety of people and their interests.          books such as the @caps, the @caps's @caps, and @caps @caps have been removed from many library shelves. though people @month check these books out, many others find them either offensive or think they should not mix with every day books. i have read a decent amount of each of the above readings, and have found the books to be full of remarkable things which have taught me a lot. if books are banned from libraries, it almost seems as if they're limiting our education.      why would a book be published, or written for that matter, if we were not intended to read it? any book could be offensive to any one person. any article, song, or film could be offensive. but, there will always be a crowd it appeals to. and that crowd deserves to enjoy every last word. censorship in libraries has gone on too long, it is time for the world to freely take part in the literature that interests them.               the solution to library censorship is the division of books into categories and sub-categories. first by subject, down to the author. therefore, books that @month be offensive are listed as such, but are still available to those who want to read them.      censorship in libraries takes away from individual freedom every day. people should be able to read what they enjoy and not be ridiculed for it. all books are written to be read, and with the division of such books, everyone can agree upon this: books help us grow. growth is not meant to be limited, nor is freedom.
0.6 do you think having inappropriate or offensive books, magazines, movies or music should be found in a public library? some books could be very offensive to people and when they take their children or younger siblings to the library, they don't want them looking at that. others prefer looking at it which would anger them if they were taken away. not all parents find some of the things in libraries offensive, even if they @month be. having music, magazines, movies or books that aren't appropriate for children should just be put into a different section, not taken away from those who enjoy it.      even though having children look at something they shouldn't could be bad, it's also bad and unfair to those who only come to the library to view those things. it shouldn't be taken away from them.  if parents don't want their children seeing those things, the shouldn't take them to that section. some adults don't enjoy seeing it, which can be understandable. no matter what, someone wouldn't be very happy about the decision.      in libraries, there is usually an adult section and kids section. if an adult doesn't want their child seeing something, they could simply take them to children's section where it won't be seen. in the children's section it's hard to find things that would be considered 'offensive' to adults. for the adults or teenagers who enjoy viewing these things, they could be in a section far away from the children. taking things that people like away from someone is wrong and it would be mean to take that away from those who enjoy it.      recently, the world has been turning into something it shouldn't. some of the most disgusting and cruel things happen every day and you could probably find this news in a library. it's understandable if you wouldn't want your child around that, but i it's wrong to take away those things from the people that love that stuff. for example, scary movies could be very disturbing and too violent for a young child but they could be an adults favorite thing to watch. thats why, if you put the more offensive things in a different section, the kids wouldn't notice it was even there.      if children were put into a different section, they wouldn't even notice the offensive things adults find. taking away the things some adults @month find offensive is like taking away the children's section, unfair. it wouldn't be fair to take away something that some adults or teenagers only come to the library for. not all adults would understand both sides but i can see where both sides are coming from. if i had children i wouldn't want them seeinig things that are offensive, but i would keep them away from it instead of promoting against it. having music, magazines movies or books that aren't appropriate for children should just be put into a different section, not taken away from those who enjoy it
0.4 censorship is a law and it is commonly broken. you cannot censor any books, movies, music, or magazines. the law of censorship is usually broken in libraries. i feel that censorship affects the writers and school system.     in the us people have the right to expressed their beliefs and feelings on any type of topic that is brought up. many libraries are taking away the right of that by not allowing certain books to not be read in classes or not allowing the students to watch certain types of movies. i think that this would offend the person whom wrote the book or the writter of the script for a movie. if they librarian doesn't want a certain type of book in her library then she shouldn't have that job or she shouldn't have books at all. just because she doesn't like the genre of books doesn't mean that somebody else who comes in won't want to read it. if a teacher doesn't want her class to see a movie because it's something that she doesn't like then she shouldn't even show movies at all in her class.      in school we aren't allowed to read about certain topics in the library, because the school system feels that it is bad for us to know about. if we want to learn about something we should be able to. maybe we don't want to learn about something the teacher is teaching us about. do we take away everything the teacher used to learn about that topic? do we take the teacher out of the classroom? no. we show respect and we read what they want us to read about and we listen to what they have to say about the topic. it's respect, we learnt that in kindergarden. i think that they should show us respect to and let us read and watch movies about the genres of books and movies they take away from us.      censorship is illegal where we live. but why isn't it taken seriously by the government? i think that they need to realize that what they are allowing is discrimonation to the writer. we get in trouble if we virbally discrimonate somebody. so why are they not doing anything about the physical discrimonation? we should be able to have higher knowledge on a topic we feel the need to learn about. i think this law should actually be enforced instead of ignored. it isn't fair to us or the writter.
0.4 in katherine paterson's writing she tells us that she does not want her child to pick up a book off the shelf that could be found offensive. but i think that there should be sections of the library that are cut off away from the public eye, but are still there for those certin people.     if my child were to pick up a book that was not for his/or her age group i would not get made, because i know that some of the book groups are close to others them some, but they are for everyone to see, which could be offensive to some. i would tell my son/ or daughter that that book is not for you, and we would go and pick out a new book to read.     over all i think that there should be sections of the library that are made for a certin age group, and should not be seen by kids. because once i was that little kid, and went wondering through the miles of shelfs to find a really wonderful book to read, but long behold that didn't happen, i had wondered along to find a book that was not in my age group.     so i think that there needs to be more careful eyes in the library staff to make sure that those kind of things will never happen again.
0.4 libraries have always had interesting materials, such as, books, music, movies, and magazines, and there always will be. libraries are one of the best places to find those materials.          i do not believe that libraries should have to remove those materials from their shelves because maybe some people find them interesting? thats all that libraries like are people interested in reading their books. if some people find different books offensive then they shouldn't go near those books. if they have a complaint then they should just keep it to themselves and not ruin the chance for others to check them out.     libraries shouldn't have to take certain material out of there shelves because some people don't like them, its your choice to read that book, nobody is making you read something that makes you feel uncomfortable. now say if there were a numerous amount of people that take offense to the materials in the library, then the library could decide whether they want to or not, but they still dont need to be told what to do. its their business and they decide what materials stay and which ones go.     if i was one of those who took offense to a book in the library then i would just keep it to myself. i wouldn't like to go through all of that trouble of arguing and complaining just becouse of one book. think of others before you think of yourself sometimes and what their interests are. thats less trouble you will have to go through later on in life.
0.4 do you think books, music, movies or anything else that could have something offensive be removed from the shelves from our libraries? well this is what im going to talk about in my essay.     i do not think that certain materials should be removed from the shelves. the reason is, is because just because you don't like something that one book might have in it dosen't mean that another person won't. also, some book that have offensive things in them can help you realize the consequenses that could happen of it could reinform you about those kind of things. also if you think the reading material is going to be something you wouldn't read or you think is not appropriate then just don't read it, it saves it so when someone else that actually wants to read something like that then let them.      sometimes i will go to the library to find a book that i saw somewhere in a different store and they wouldn't have it, so i would ask about it and they said that if they didn't have it there then it must something in it that could be offensive to others. but i know that alot of people like those nasty gross books and some don't. people have different opinons about things, so just because the person that is aloud to take the books of the shelve or put them on don't like the book or thinks its not appropriate dosn't mean that someone else will not like it either.      well, here is what i think of certain books or anything else that contains reading that are being taking off the shelves. i hope it makes people realize that they do like other things than you so leave the offensive readings out so people can learn that if they don't like it then don't read it
0.4 according to katherine paterson, who wrote an article about censorship in the library. should we beable to have the right to take a book, magazine, movie etc. off the shelf freely? whether if we're offend by it or not.      i believe we should not have that right to pull thing off of shelves freely. if we had that right it would cause problems from many stand points if you think about it.         one problem it could cause is people thoughts towards a book, movie, cd and so forth. if one person looks at and is like 'i don't like this and this about it.' and then just pulls it of the shelf, then thats one less things for somebody who does like it. now since that person doesn't like what the material offers to the public, doesn't mean somebody else dosen't. nobody in this entire world is exactly the same. every body in this world has their likes and dislikes. if they had the freedom to take things, then there would be nothing for anybody to read, listen too, watch, eat etc.          you also have to think how would that affect the business of stores, libraries, and other businesses. if everybody is pulling everything off shelves, what would there be to sell or read. if a business is not making any money, then they're going to have to be closed down. ecspecially in today economy no business wants to run low on money.        in katherine's article at the end she said 'and then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' that is basicly reiterating what i said earlier about peoples likes and dislikes about everything. if you don't want your kids or anybody else kids looking at something you believe is offensive. you should take it up with one of the workers so they can move it to a different section. like a section for older kids and people.     mainly it falls on parents on what content you want your kids looking at. you're the ones to raise them the way you want to raise. if you think they are to young for something then thats when you tell them no or whatever. we should not have the right to take anything off of a shelf. books, movies, music and etc. are for entertainment. if it doesn't entertain you does not mean it does not for anybody else
0.6 in our society today there is always going to be something that someone disagrees with or dislikes.  items should not be removed from the shelves just because someone takes offense to it.  everyone has a book or movie out there that they disagree with, but if it is removed just for that reason then there would be a very limited selection left.  students would take advantage of this and they would have educational books removed.     removing items from shelves removes history.  our history books tell us stories of slavery and descrimination.  if someone takes offense to this and has it removed then we are losing a part of our history that needs to be heard and taught so that it does not occur again.  items in the library are items that you can choose to check out or choose to not check out.  if you take offense to an item in the library then you do not have to read it.  something that you @month take as offensive @month be something that inspires and encourages someone else.  wether you like an item or dislike it is a matter of your own personal opinion and decisions should not be made based on someones opinion alone.    think about it.  if you have a favorite book, movie, or song then would you want it to be gotten rid of based on someones opinion?  you have the right to be able to read,watch, or listen to whatever you want.  it should not be limited based on someone elses opinion.  it would cause much argument among people.  some have different opinions then others on a certain item in the library which will lead to argument and possible violence.     there are so many wonderful and inspiring books and movies out there and there is always going to be someone who does not like at least one of them.  if items are removed based on someones opinion then there will be a very limited selection left.  people read for enjoyment and knowledge.  they deserve to have a wide selction to choose from.     in our society today there is always going to be something that someone disagrees with or dislikes.  our opinions should not be based on a person's dislike of something.  if they take offense to it then they have the right to ignore it.  there are so many books and movies out there that teach us of life before our generation.  we need these books and movies so that there are not repeat events of all of the rough times our ancestors had to go through.  we need these books for future generations so that we are able to teach and guide them.  items should not be removed from the shelves based on the fact that someone takes offense to it.
0.6 practice @caps you @caps     the @location is considered one of the greatest countries in the world because it is a free country. in the @date's people migrated here to escape the control that their government had in their homeland. in @location we practice freedom of speech. if we censor materials like books, music, movies, etc. it would defeat the entire purpose of @location and it's @organization.     everyone has their own personality with likes and dislikes. not everyone likes the same music or is interested in reading the same subject, thats why its wonderful that their is a variety of everything. if you start banning or censoring certain things then how will people learn? there is nothing wrong with learning about negative things because that teaches people lessons so they know @caps or @caps not to do if in that situation. when you censor 'bad things' it creates naive thinkers, which only leads to discrimination.      i agree that for children there should warnings for material that parents @month find offensive. for example, movies have ratings for different age groups, and books could do the same. of course its up to the parents if they want to follow the recommendations but banning something all together is not neccessary.     i personally learned a lot of things from @caps i've seen on television. whats on television @month be considered 'street smart' education but that is good. today we live in a scary and violent society, so being 'street smart' is an advantage. if television was censored then people would not know @caps to do in a bad situation because they have never experienced or seen of it before.     if books, movies, magazines, music, etc. are removed from shelves then @location is not practicing @caps it preaches to the many of people who come here in search of freedom.
0.4 yes i believe that books should be removed if they have derogatory terms in there such as racial slurs disrespecting the race of any human etc. but the music part is up in the air because like kids hearing songs with cussing talking about drugs and all that other bad stuff shouldnt because like the way i see it everybodys gonna learn about it somehow and when you hear songs for multiple songs you tend to begin to know the wordsd and if you repeat the words in front of a parent thats when they can step into the aprent roll and tell them that the drugs and words are nto good. really though if kids pick the book up and are able to read what it says then i feel like they should know right from wrong by then and clearly if someone is using bad language such as the @caps word they would know that its wrong and if they continue to listen to it thats on them.
0.4 as said before there would be no books for anyone to read if everybody removed what they felt was offensive. the libraries would have a very watered down material base and there would be no reason to use this place anymore. some material is not suitable for young ages there is much from advanced material that can be learned; thus the libraries should sperate their books only as they do already.     some material does seem to advanced for others but these materials are needed to advance academic gwroth. some people should think that school should not read @person due to racism in the south. this was true history so there should be no restrictions to that sort of book. if there were those soprt of restrictions then schools would lack much of histories best literature.     just as the movies do for the gerneal population, @caps is for @num and up while @num is for @num and up. these are good standard that keep the youth from seeing what they are not yet ready for. this concept should be used the same way in these libraries where there seems to be a problem.yet this is already done in libraries. there would be no reason to break these sectiopns up more then they already are broken. there is the young adult section, adult, and youth. those are the main catagories that most perople want sperate due to offensivce material such as drugs, sex, and alchohol.     much of the media that is public today is censered and that benefits much of the youth, but there is a point where the public needs to realize that sheltering the outh can stunt them academically
0.2 some people think that offensive books should be off the selves, but some other people think that this should not be allowed.     i do not believe that certain materials (books, movies, and magazines.  if we take evey book off the self then we would not have any book to read.  if we start taking offensive books off the self then every body coming in would be taking @num books off the self.  then with in two days there would be not books left.     if we do not have any books then are eyes would be bad. we should not take books off the selves because of some people like to read.  if people do not like the books in the library then they should not go to the library to get books.     this is why people should not take offensice books off the selves. this will make peoples eyes so bad that they would not see good at all.
0.6 should the librari be censord on the books it has on the shelvs? i think it should be. there are many offensive books and thangs on the shelvs. i wouldnt want my kid or anybody els kid reading offensive books. so lets get rid of all the bad stuff or atleast filtyer it all.     i beleve any book, movie and magazines that have alot of profanity or bad pictures in them should be removed or not be able to be cheked out to a certion age. if they wana keep teh books on the shelves they should make it where you have to be in high school and have a permsion slip to get the books. removing teh  books and thangs complitly @month cause to much troubl so we should defntly make sure the kid is a certian age and has permsion.     i would not want my @num year old kid read a book with bad language in it. kids cach on to that stuff and they will start talking like that and it would not be a good thing. there is alot going on in socaty now a days that badly influnce children. they do not need to read about how guys rob places and are crimanals. i think thats why we have so much of a probly to day becouse evry one sees it at a young age and they want to be lyk that wehn tehy get older but that is a very bad thing. they do not need books and movies that make it worse on them and make them think bad things are good. if we do not filter wat they do at a young age they will end up being hellins and outa of countral becouse they will think just becouse someone in a book or movie did it that its ok for them to do it but its not.     i would not wnat a young kid to read bad things. i say lets put a ge limit on them and mack our socity beeter and are kids to become beter adoults later on in ther life. we need to filter out the bad and put new in for our younger kids. if we don't who knows how theyl grow up to be the world could go to hell if we dont stop the kids from learning bad things. so lets get the fi,ltering satrted and save the world and our kids future.
0.6 people from all over the world have many different opinions. if someone doesnt like something they do have the choice of not looking at it. therefore, i believe that when you find something in a library that comes offencive to you you should not be able to remove it.     one main reason why i feel that the offensive things shouldent be taken out of the libraries is because, not everyone @month feel the book, movie, magizine, or music is offencive. people have their own opinions on everything, and if someone takes out a book or any thing in the library because they feel its bad, the other person is going to miss out on something they like to read.     another reason i feel the bad things shouldent be taken out of the library is because, some people could get mad at another person for taking all the offencive things out of the library. many people like the offencive things in books, movies and soforth. i think from my own prospective that i like having a little bad in my life and if reading a book, watching a movie, listening to music, or even reading a magizine is what it takes i want to be able to go to a library and pick out something good with out haveing to worry if its there or not.     in my own opinion, i believe that with out offencive remarks or words there wouldnt be any humor in books and stuff today. just because the offencive things seem rude and unapproite doesn't mean that they are. it's just something said to make a book or anything interesting and funny.     although some offincive things in libraries can seem too unapproiate, i believe that if they're there then obviously there not too bad, and they shouldnt be taken out because one person feels that its not something that belongs in a library. everyone has there own opinions in life and sometimes keeping them to yourself is the best thing to do.
0.8 imagine walking out of your home and you see right down the street a giant bonfire, right in the open.  you see men walking into a library empty handed and walk out carrying armfuls of books, magazines, movies, and other media.  the men then toss them into the raging inferno and you seem them become incinerated, lost forever.  this is what will happen if we let censorship of our libraries take place. we should not let censorship of our libraries take place since it violates a constitutional right, will gradually make our society more and more ignorant, and will let this nation slide from a democratic nation to one where the beliefs and ideals of the people are controlled by a small group of people.     letting censorship of our libraries take place will violate a basic constitutional right, plain and simple.  in the @organization it clearly says that there will be freedom of the press.  by tossing out certain literary works this right will be thrown to the side and by violating one constitutional right, what will come next? will our freedom of speech be negated, or our freedom to assemble?  as citizens of the @location we can not let this happen to our great nation.     by allowing certain books and essays to be thrown out of our libraries, the people's knowledge base will eventually shrink down drastically.  for example take @person's theory of evolution, a very sensitive subject among people of the @caps faith.  if all of his works regarding that were to be thrown out, much information that was very valuable to biologists would be lost and those biologists would not be able to improve upon the existing pool of information.  if this was to take place our civilization would experience a lessening intellect and a expanding ignorance regarding many fields of knowledge.     picture @caps in the @date.  hitler's @organization has taken power and our systematically destroying all materials they find to be subversive to the @organization cause, only allowing materials that contained beliefs and ideals that they thought were correct to exist in libraries.  this is exactly what we would be doing if we allowed censorship of our libraries to take place.  the censoring of the libraries would be controlled by a relatively small group of people which means that the censoring would be controlled by that same people's beliefs and ideals, and those same beliefs and ideals would thus  be forced upon the people, shaping the beliefs and ideals of the masses to those select few.       in conclusion, letting censorship take place in our public libraries will dismantle the basic structure of our society by violating a constitutional right, making our society gradually become more and more ignorant, and letting the beliefs and ideals of our people rest in the hands of a select few.  this is not what our @caps @caps envisioned @location to become and they were right.  letting censorship exist in our public libraries is simply wrong
0.6 the censorship in a library should be kept the same as it is already.  a few reason explain why the censorship is alright as it is.  those reason are that the parents should be in charge of the books their children read, that not all people agree on censorship, and that the libraries have books of different subjects that people like to read.     the first reason is that parents shoud be in charge of what their children read.  if the parents would just tell their children no to a certain book, then the child will not read it.  if the parent does not want their child to go into a section then, the parents can just say keep away from that area.  although, sometimes the child @month stray away from its parents it is not very likely that the parent will not notice.  that is why the parents should be in charge of what their children read.     the second reason is that not all people agree on censorship.  certain people think that religion is important no matter what the book shows, but others would think parts of religious book (nudity, swears, etc...) is extremely innapropriate.  some people would say that books like @caps mythology books are innapropriate and need to be censored, although others think these books are past culture and that they should remain in the libraries forever.  most children will look at these books and think that the books are to big to read, so they would not even look at them.  few people would agree on censorships, and a lot of people would disagree.     the third reason is that libraries have different subjects than the innapropriate books.  the people can look at a different book and completely ignore the others.  it is not like a child will go up to the dirtiest book they can find and say '@caps i want to read that one.' the child will probably want something that relates to a television show or a movie of some sort.  the point being that a person can read other books than just innapropriate books.     library books should be kept the same because the parents should be in charge of what their children read, not all people agree on censorship, and libraries have different subjects that people want to read. the censorship should be fine according to some people other would disagree.  the children probably would not look at the innapropriate book anyways, because they would not interest the child.
0.6 in my opinion i believe all types of material should be allowed in libraries. if someone takes offense to a particular topic or section they dont have to read it. not just certain types of genre and themes or magazines. everyones different meaning they have differents personalities and views on what they like. i think libraries such actually expand thier variety of books.          libraries that don't cater to a persons desires or interests , what would make them want to stay?  libraries should be filled with all sorts of subjects appealing to everyone. just like how they have an adult and children section. everyone has a place were that feel like they belong. even if some people get offended. a person can get offended anywhere not just by a certain magazine or some music style.      i do believe if there is a certain line of respect of course. nothing should get to out of line were it's an issue with a numerous amount of consumers complaining about the same topic. you can tell if a certain section or material is crossing the line. each section should be written to speak the truth but also in a respectful manner.      in the times that i've been to the library there @month be some things that i don't agree with how certain things are certain ways. but then i see a person really enjoying their time at the library. i know when i go i always find  my style of music that appeals to me. not just the same thing everywhere i go. theres always a choices, different options and more things i can learn about.     keeping all the materials like books, music, movies, etc is a way to appeal for everyone. i person should have their opinion and the choice to be able to read what they like. there will always be a certain movie or book you don't care for ,but others might. if everyone told what they like and don't like about a  certain book. where's the variety? what books will be left? everyone has their on thoughts on what they like, if theres a topic you don't like you probably know least about it. and the library is a good way to search and find information about anything
0.2 i think we should not take it off the shelf beacus what @month be offensive to you @month not be offensive to me. or some thing that fun or i think or beneficial to me. and what @month be offensive to me @month not be offensive to you. and i think if some thing are offensive to some one thay should just walk off, or just dont mind i
0.6 i do not think books should be censored from the shelves of library's. katherine is correct in many ways. we would not have any books if everyone removed the ones the disliked. the world would lose alot of information on important things in their worlds. i'm writing this to explain why i don't think books should be censored.     i don't think book's should be removed if they are offensive to some people because they, sometimes, help people see the errors in their ways like a book about gloryfiying the way white men and women treated @caps @caps men and women. now a days people would read that book and if they were racist they wouldn't be after that book,because they see how wrong @caps is. music is freedom of speech, some artist's see themselves as 'liberaters', 'idol's',and even 'love spreading',yes their are some songs that could be 'seem' offensive but you'll never know how high a @caps will grow if u cut @caps down in example the song titled '@caps' by @caps @caps,@caps has catholic churches furious because they automaticly assume she's disrespecting @caps when in reality she's speaking a whole different tone.     people learn special, powerful  life leasons from things or situations that are shunned by our society and @caps will probably always remane that way,we don't know.but one thing we do know is we can change what we do in the present and better what were going to do in the future.
0.0 libraries are plase that you can get a book you shute be          oergat to be lick soem ales you are won porsn you have eve           rhit to got in book you wat. i bleva that ther shou not be a         what to sop pelpar of reede. so i belev that the suet stop bloe       us bie tack the book of the shaf
0.6 the content of a library should be full of various material even if one @month find certain materials offensive.  just because someone @month think a material is offensive does that mean we just ignore the subject, forgeting it altogether?  some subjects @month be awkward to talk about, read about, or even think about, but that doesn't mean we should ingnore them.     one subject that @month be awkward to read about is sexually transmitted diseases.  you often see people walking through the library skimming through the aisles, once in a while opening a book to see what it's about, but when they come to the section on sexually transmitted diseases they just walk on by, to uncomfortable to be seen in the area.  it's not a subject that people normally read for fun, but everyone should be aware of it. there are many subjects like this that everyone should be aware even if you think it doesn't effect you.     another reason to keep all books in the library is to be informed of history.  some history @month be gruesome and completely crazy, but we should be aware of those things and not forgot about them.  the @caps for example.  that was a very dark period in history.  over six million people died becasuse just one person didn't like what they believed in.  it's sometimes hard to read about, but you should be aware of what happened in the past no matter how depressing it is.  we should be aware to prevent another event like that from happening.     people's likes in music vary.  there are so many different types and styles of music.  some music @month be offensive to other people, but does that mean you should get rid of it at the library?  the library should always have a large variety of different music.  often people would like to widen there music intellect and the library is the perfect place to do that.      everyone is different. we never all like the same thing.  taking materials from the library to avoid the subject doesn't stop someone from finding that information.  if people wanted information and they couldn't find it at the library they would most likely find another way to get that information.  having a vary in books, music, movies, and magazines make what the library is, a place to learn new things, no matter the subject.
0.4 have you ever watched a movie that had some scenes you didnt't want your kids to watch with you? what are you suppose to do when this problem happens time and time agian? do you just tell your kids to close there eyes and cover there ears? well i honestly think that shouldn't ever have to happen to you.     i think that you as a parent or adult should be warned about certain behaviors during a moive. that you do not approve your child of watching even if it is with you ,it's just flat out wrong i would say. so i say that we should get some kind of extra warning that these innapporiate behaviors are showing up in movies. parents should be able to know what there kinds are bout to watch is ok for there age and what not.      so to wrap this all up nice and sweet. just make some kind of label that says that there might be things in the movies or whatever item such as books and magazines also. that there might be things that a parent will find innapporiate for a child to watch or read. if the people that make these products do this it will be much more easier for parents to do the right thing for there children
0.6 books, movies, magazines, music, and most of all, life. we all know whats wrong, and what's right.     every school is different. some schools have limits on their books, such as if you're two years old, and reading something like @person, then that's gonna be inappropriate. if you're sixteen and reading a @person book, then that's too inappropriate for their age limit. every age is different, so your not going to find some forty-three year old hobo on the streets reading, '@caps @caps @caps' by @person. most likely, he'll be reading a mystery book, or something appropriate for his age not for someone that's five. books shouldn't be banned because some elementary mother doesn't want her seven year old reading '@caps'. just because some mothers want it banned, doesn't mean it should be. be smarter and watch what your kids are reading, it shouldn't have to be banned from other children just because you don't want your kid reading it.     don't we all agree that music is life? not everyone has to listen to rap, nor do they have to listen to opera. don't you see that we have musical artist in the world that depend on music? so why should rap be banned just because it talks about killing, drugs, and drinking. i say who cares? don't listen to it if you don't like it, it doesn't mean you have to ruin it for everyone else. i love all kinds of music, so nothing should be banned. in my opinion i hate christian songs, i think they're too slow, and constantly talking about @caps, but that doesn't mean i should ruin it for everyone else, just because i hate it. everyone is different, no one is the same. music helps me gets through life, and i know it helps you get through yours too, it shouldn't be banned.     movies, movies, movies! video games, video games, video games! we all love cuddling and watching movies together, but not all movies are right for us. movies have ratings like video games do. ratings show what's appropriate for a twelve year old verses a twenty-five year old. adults would most likely be playing a rated @caps game, and watching rated @caps movies. little kids about the age of six would be playing rated @caps games, and watching rated @caps movies. as you can see everyone is different especially when it comes to these things. rated @caps movies usually have gore, sexual themes, strong language, and things little kids should never watch. it doesn't mean it should be banned, maybe blocked in your home, but not banned.     in my opinion, i think all movies, books, music, video games, etc., shouldn't be banned. it just should all be carefully watched to see who's hands it lands into, and who's eyes are viewing it. we should be responsible enough to pick out the material for ourselves. no one should tell me what not to read or watch: unless i am a youth. then material should be suppervised by my parents.
0.4 when you go to a library you think its going to be a place that is a good influence. your not thinking when you send your kids their that there's going to be bad things. most people go the the library to study or use the computers... but what about the other people?     i went to the library and saw racest books most adults would find that offensive especially if its an afracan american. the thing is that people would also go there and check the books out to sutdy about the old times it's not there to offend people. some books are very infromational and people need to study and learn about the past so that it doesnt happen again.     another peroblem most people have is with the adult books parents defantly dont want their children looking or checking thoughs books out. but when noone stops them from checking the books out there really is not anything you can do about it. i believe that libraries should have an age limit for checking out certen books.     the last thing is the music it has bad language in it and kid can just check them out with out even trying hard. most parants the to sheild their kids so they will be good and not use dirty language but when the and go to a comunity plase and just listen to anything that causes a peopblem. personially i think that it gives the library a bad name and therefore that get little business.     you know that if you were a parent you really wouldn't want your kids grabbing racest, adult books, and music and you would like for the government to take some the books and music out of the library. i believe that their should be a vote to see if we could have thoughs books amd music removed or atleast put in an adult section in the back.      my main point of this essay is that they either need to have voting for what goes into the library or they need to start censioring the books and @caps's they put in the library and make accessalble to the comunity. the up side to doing that is the library would get mor customers and that means the government would make more money
0.2 does the book @caps @caps?                                                               @caps's alot of books out @caps that i would love to take off the shelve's but the one book i would to take off the shelve's would be 'to @caps a @caps'. while i read that book it had alot of offensive language and alot of graphic not only in the book but in the movie to. on top of all that both the movie and the book weren't good at all. the only thing good about the movie is @caps was a few dramatic and thats it. another thing that caught my eye was when the author repeatedly kept on saying the same offensive language over and over again. it's like the liked to keep on saying the same old thing using repitions. but some how it got an award and is one of the must for high school student's. i think the story overall was alright beside the fact @caps was offensive in it though. books like that shouldn't be put on shelves and if they are the need to take the offensive language out but obviously people liked the book or it wouldn't have awards.                                   so obviously 'to @caps a @caps' was a good story but when it comes down to it could offend alot of people i hear people talking about the book still and i read it last year. so in @caps, i think @caps should be censorship in libraries.
0.6 'all of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf..' said by katherine paterson. books are used to entertain and even teach readers in certain aspects of life. not exactly all books are offensive but some are. those who are, should be taken off the shelfs, especially if it is in a school library. children could take that offensive or violent book into action. other children could show the book to other peers. and also, children can get very offended. now should offensive books be taken off the shelfs?         children nowadays are being motivated alot. whether it's through television shows, video games, or even music. on the news, there has been reports about children being influenced to have a gun and hang themselves, etc. books are meant to entertain readers in a good way and not teach them to become a violent person. some readers who read such things can turn those words into action. then the student could be in trouble. and people really wouldn't want that.          children have a tendency of showing off to friends. if a student sees something offensive or violent on a book, there is a big chance that they will show it to their peers. just because children think it's cool. having one person read this could be a problem, now imagine having more than just one, a whole clique seeing this. it could end up in a huge problem, not only for the children and their parents, but also for the school. the children learning these new things from the book can cause the children to use everyday and make it popular. the school can have a bad image from the students. passing on the information can become a conflict, and people certainly do no want that.           school is not only a teaching building, but also a social place. there are cliques in every school. within the each person there is a different color, religion, style, and personalities. children can be easily hurt. if books are being offensive, it can just easily hurt anyone reading that book. once again, books are meant to entertain readers and not to hurt them. so why even have authors write something offensive in their books? maybe authors feel the need to add interest in the book and suspense, but not all readers would take it easily. hurting people isn't a fun thing to do, and people certainly do not want to do that.               so why have offensive books in shelfs? these books can cause children to use it in action, to show it off to other peers, and to hurt them as well. children nowadays have it hard on themselves, why make it harder. books are meant to entertain readers, why not just do that. so yes, take the offensive books off and there will be no problems.
0.6 the belief of certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from shelves if they are offensive, depends on the situation the material is relating to. if one wants to see these type of resources, then he/she must be mature enough to withstand it. it all depends on where the material is at in the library and what situation it's in. if it is in the children's area, i highly suggest that it should be removed from there, since it's clear that a child should not process this type of information. if it's in the teen section, then the person must be mature enough to take this sort of inappropriate matter or just leave it be. in the adult section however, there should be no argument of any sort because it is obvious that the person must be fully mature to take in this sort of material.      one example on why this sort of aspect on whether or not inappropriate material should be removed are the comic books called '@caps tales' or '@caps the @organization'. these type of materials have some from inappropriate to disturbing events in the books, but have been distributed to the teen section. now from ages @num years of age usually spend their time there and would likely read this type of information. some teens would be horrified of looking through these books and others would be fascinated by it. it varies through the people and what type of material they would like to read. it all depends on the situation where this material is distributed in.      another example on whether or not inappropraite material should be taken out of the shelves is how movies are put in situations. there was once a time, a young lady around her early teens who wanted to check out a type of movie in which she have never saw before. so once she checked it out, she watched it with her parents and saw some uneasy sections during this movie. the person should have thought this through before jumping into the situation. if the person was mature enough to go through this matter, it would have been fine; but she was young still and so it made the matter worse.     whether or not inappropriate material should be removed from shelves depends on how and where the material is distributed and so it shows that one person can change the difference in the situation.therefore whether this type of material should be taken off the shelves depends, once again, on the situation it is at
0.4 dear newspaper;     in libraries i do not feel it is neccasry to take stuff away that poeple could find offensive, because honestly if it offends you than don't look at it. you are your own person and can make your own decisions, if this so called offensive material is not veiwed offensive by someone. then why should that person be  punished by someone who has to make a big deal out of something. just because you don't like it doesn't mean i don't like it.          if someone finds a book offensive then don't read it, if there is a magazine that you find offensive, don't read it. it is as simple as that, people are wise enough to know what is good and what is bad for them. there is no reason why someone can't choose what they want to get, where they want it. from observations of my own i have seen numerous times when someone has found someones music offensive, but they don't say anything. they just ignore it, the world needs more people like that. more people who will stand up for what they believe in and won't judge others for what they belief in.     it seems as if the world is becoming filled with a bunch of people who care way to much about what other people are doing. that is not a bad thing nessaccarily but everyone will be offended by something but it is your choice to whether or not let it bug you for the rest of your life. listen to what ever music, read what ever books or magazines that you want. if someone finds them offensive, so be it. you are your own person and that won't ever change. do what makes you happy and nothing else.
0.4 there are many kinds of books, music, movies, and magazines in one library. people all over the world have different interests in differtent subjects. some people take offence to certain books, songs, movies, magazines, etc. another person @month not and think its offencive at all. for example, a religous book that talks about @caps being one guy when some people beleive differently. the book should not be put away, for there are also books that will be all about your beliefs.          the variety of subjects in a library such as songs, magazines and everything else in the library is huge. there should never be a book, movie, or item removed when one person takes offence to it because in katherine paterson quote, its makin the point if someone decides they want to remove a book from the shelf anyone could. which eventually would leave people with no variety in books which would start a huge problem. people would not be able to read as much as they'd like because they would not have the ability to pick between many options. the library provides information for teachers, students, researchers, writers and for readers who do it as a hobby. if that was takin away from people, the people would become less informed about many things in the world.         in @caps freedom is important and we expect it, freedom of speech and the freedom to have your own opinions and interests. therefor if items were being removed from a public place that gives that, @caps would not let this happen. people have the right to like whatever they want, if someone takes offence to an item in the library they should walk away from it and not stress about removing it
0.4 if i had the right to remove books, music, magazines or other things that were offensive from a library i wouldn't do it. i wouldn't do it because everybody as a right to read, lisen and see whatever they want. if people really didn't want to see offensive books or anything else why would they be seeing it in the first place. some parents think that they shouldn't have offensive books beacuse it would affect their children.their would be a change in kids education.     everybody has the right to read whatever they want. their are different kinds of people that like to read different kinds of things. if books would have to be remove from the library then everybody would start taking all the books out. one way or another evrybody ends up reading all those offensive books at a certain point of their lifes anyways.     the parents that are so worried about what their kids would see at a library should inform themselves of what their kids are reading and prohibid them from doing it. in my opinion i think that if parents took the time to explains their kids the good and bad things about life it wouldn't be that offensive for their children.     another reason of why i wouldn't remove books from a library is because it would affect the education of many kids. removing books means taking away history from them. there are many painters in our history that painted naked womans many people find that offensive. i think they should never take that history from them beacuse they are just learning things about their history.     books, music, magazines, ect should not be remove from libraries. because those things are important for everybody whether you read or not. removing this items would just be a total chaos. they should leave the libraries just the way they are. everybody has the right to read, lisen and see whatever they want.
0.4 i belive that beople have the right to know and learn about stuff even if it is found offensive, the reasone why i say this is because if one person finds it offensive doesn't mean that another person might think it is. if people think that a film from back in the late @num's about the @organization that is used for educational perposes is racist, then they need to just grow up and to go back to school for this stuff. just because some people think that a book with vulger language is offencive then they need to know that more than half of the worlds book have profanitey in them and just because it does, doesn't mean that they need to be removed form the shelfs in the library.     i have had my own incounters with books that i thought were offencive, there was a book that i was reading in my fresh year of high school and there were people in it that were part of the @person and they were having meetings and one guy said that he hated negros and they he had picked one for tonigh and were going to lynch them with the nuse they had made the night before and that really hurt me because i have some one in my famliy that is black and to think about someone doing that to him, that would just break my heart and i would probaly go out and find the people that did it and kill them.       in the quote that was writen by katherine paterson, she talked about how if she has the right to remove a book then we do to and if we do so then there will be no more books left for us on the shelf is a great way to say that almost everybook we have has something volger in them and if we were to take them all away then there would be none left. if there was the posibility of all the books being taken away from us then there would be a huge uprising and everything would be going down hill form there, because there are people that can't go a day with out reading a part of there book and some people have devoted three hours to reading ounce a day.     what im trying to say is that there is no way to get rid of our books today that have volger langage or something offencive in them because if we tryed to do that then we would be taking every book away in the world and then no one would be learning anything
0.4 the question is, should we censor materials in libraries if it is offensive?  in my opinion i dont think they should censor the material.  some things that we read, see, and hear are just going to be offensive, and we cant control everything that offends us.     i do agree that people have freedom of speech, but not over everything.  people need to stop over reacting to something that might have been said @date.  some things just need to be left in the past and kept there.  for example, some @caps @caps are still upset over slavery, and that happened over a @num @date @date.   censoring certain things means that people are not going to learn from the mistakes of our pass.      we need to stop all this over protection in our libraries of all places.  children need to know what has happened in our past to see what they can change in our future.  why? why is my only question to why the people want to censor material in the libraries.  are they trying to keep their children from seeing it or just for their own selfish reasons?       my conclusion is that they should not censor material because it offends someone.  i have been offended by lots of things that i have read but i dont try to get them censored or removed from the place i read it.  sometimes you just have to deal with things that you dont like or dont agree with sometimes.
0.4 certain books, magazines or even music contains mature or graphic nature. the music will always have ratings, just like movies. they dont need to be deleted from a library unless it is an elementary school. most language arts are sorted through out the library in an orderly fashion, so the younger children will only purchase there age level books, or art of choice.      music always contains warnings for the rating of the book. a child should never murchase a mature level book. books, movies, and music are all the same. they are made for certain types of audiance. if a movie is rated @caps, then it is made for eighteen or older audiance. they are situated throughout the library for children, adults, and teens. the children just need to stay in there own age levels.      if there is a mature or graphic book in a childrens library then that should cause conflict. any parent would agree with that statement. the only way these mature arts can be shared without conflict is through public libraries. public libraries that are divided to connect with all age groups
0.6 removing literature from a shelf should not be permitted just because you think something about it. everyone has different ideas and opinions about what is appropriate and what is not appropriate. if you don't like a certain book or you do not want your children reading that book then don't take them to the library in the first place.     in a public library you have to be old enough to buy a library card to check out a book, so if you are old enough to have a library card then obviously you arent going to find a book that is innapropriate for your own age. you @month find a book that is immature to you, but you do not have to read it. men and women go to public libraries to learn. if you want to learn about something that is offensive, then you won't beable to if one person comes along and doesn't approve of the book. is that fair? you tell me.     in a school library yes there should be a limit to what children can and cannot read. in a junior high school the standards should be different compared to an elementary or a senior high school. in an elementary children are required to read as part of their academics, but they are not old enough to want to learn about something offensive, therefore they will not need those types of books in their library. in a junior high school there should be a limit on the offensiveness but the students still have a right to know what is going on arond them. in a senior high school students should have a right to read whatever type of book they please.     magazines are a different subject. alot of times in magazines there are advertisements for smoking products or alchoholic beverages. those types of magazines should not beable to be read in a school library. in a public library a person should have the right to read whatever he or she pleases.      in the end im saying adults and teens have a right to learn about whatever they like, but children should be young and innocent while they can. you cannot keep them shielded from commercials and people advertising these things themselves, but what you can prevent you should. nobody wants their children growing up too fast, but do not limit their growth.
0.4 i believe that if something is found offense to someone then it dosent mean its offense to someone else. in libraries there are books, music, movies, magazines, etc, some of these different type of things @month come across as offesnse to some but others @month enjoy it. therefore it shouldnt be taken away from those who enjoy reading or listening to these things.          some things such as adult novels and explict music are things people consider to be offensive. but what they dont understand is that some people actually enjoy listening or reading this material so taking it away from them is not right. everyone should be able to have different likes in these areas. everyone is not the same.     if you attend a library you should be able to find something that fits your style or sparks your intrest. if the things that people like are being taken away then its not giving them a wide variety of things they enjoy doing. its more likely closing them out on things they like because other people dont like it or find it offensive.     lastly, those that think that these things are offensive are entitled to there opinion. but so are those that believe that these things are good. there should remain a variety of different books, music, and other things that appeal to all types of personalities.     everyone has a right to say weither they dont like something. but what you dont like someone else does. so to take away things that other people enjoy is unjust.
0.4 a lot of people believe that books are useless and should not even be on a shelf. well i believe that no book is useless nor should it be removed from shelves from any library. all books are worth something toward anything like careers, and being able to learn new things.          magazines @month not be any help towards alot of things like books are, but they are something to entertain you. music is not just something you listen to, but its something to help keep you nice and relaxed while you are reading a book. movies can have a certain impact on someone; alot of people think movies are just entertainment for them to watch, but it could have some encouragement, or it can really show how a person acts if you really pay attention and look into what the movie is saying.      no book, magazine, music, or movies should be taken off shelves because they are not there for you to read or listen to or watch, but those things are all there to tell people something about things people do not even know. people should take a second look at how all of these things can really affect a persons life. more books, magazines, music, and movies should be put in the libraries of school, or even the public libraries.the more people read, watch, or listen to these things the better they @month  understand life. i have noticed from experience that people just go to the library and read a book just to relax, but yet at the same time those people really do not understand what they are reading. its really a shame that people do not look into what they are reading, thats why it would be important for more books to be put on the shelves. just like katherine paterson said: 'if i have the right to remove that book from the shelf , the work i abhor, then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. and then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' if people really understood what that quote really means then they would have a better understanding of what books actually mean in life. we should be thankful to have authors like katherine paterson in our life because these authors are there to help us understand the meaning of these amazing books in this world.
0.8 libraries are a place for everyone; from young children, to the eldery, therefore there is material to suite all ages. when you go to a library you assume that no matter what kind of book you are wanting to read, they will have it. from personal prefrences, to school research projects, libraries should have it all right? well some libraries want to take that concept away.      a library has books on nearly all subjects. that is because of the individual differences of the people that go to the library. someone of an extremist religion group could be going there to read on something of their religion. if a strict @caps would happen to find a book on the extreme religion they could be offended. that situation could go both ways though. because of the individuality of people and different beliefs and customs we are all going to appreciate and depreciate all different kinds of literature.      most of the libraries are big enough to be sorted into sections. there are sections for young adults, mature adults, children, non fiction, fiction, science fiction, and so on. if a child ventures off to the mature adult section and flips through the pages of a book that is above their maturity level, then that is the childs fault. the mature people who can handle the content of more adult-orientated books shouldn't be punished by the library removing all books of that content because a child didn't stay in their designated area.          with different cultural beliefs comes different beliefs and views of everyday things. some readers could strongly disagree with a book and others could recommend it to all of their friends and family. one book to one person could mean something totally different to another. it could be understandable if there were books about sex, for example, right next to the childrens' books, but that isn't the case in most libraries. libraries could even have a restricted section that warns readers about the content of material in the books in that specific area.      books in libraries are wrote for multiple kinds of people. age, gender, religion, maturity, race, political beliefs, and so on will all effect the way you take to a book. whether or not a book appeals to you is about your beliefs, values, or customs. with that being said, why would a library take away books that only a certain percentage of people will disagree with? taking away books of a certain subject could upset people that like that type of book or it could even pertain to their everyday lives.      a library is a place of knowlegde. it is filled with facts, beliefs, theories, and opinions of people. wouldn't removing someones opportunity to read into a subject be revoking the author and their freedom of speech? just because of a controversial subject or mature topic shouldn't mean that people shouldn't be allowed to read it. if people could only read certain literature that someone else is deciding whether or not it is okay to read, then where is their freedom?       a library is a place for everyone. it has all different kinds of books for all different kinds of people. a libraries interior could be arranged to that the young children aren't going to find a book about sex near their kid books. taking away certain books pertaining to controversial subjects isn't fair to those who don't disagree with that topic. a library should be a place of balance. a place where someone could read on anything they want to, not what certain people think they should or shouldn't read
0.4 i believe everyone has the right to voice there own oppinion on life. if we censor ones books, music, or movies because they are inapropriate, it would be like silencing an oppinion that stands out among the others. if we silence the author and there story or song how will we be able to view life in another persons view?     in the @organization we have the freedom of speech and press. these amendments make it so that otheres can voice an oppinion with out being shot down. although we have the amendments there are still restrictions on what we are aloud to publish. say we found a diary writen by @person? are we aloud to view his deepest darkest thoughts? or are we going to say that it is too dark and depressing for the average person's eyes. his ideas are different, does that mean we shouldn't show them? no we should show them, we need to educate people that there are indeed different ways of viewing life.     i believe that no matter whos ideas it is, if aloud by the author, should be aloud to be read and comprehend in our own way.     if one wishes to learn about how to murder in a @caps then i think they should be aloud to do so. the reason why; the @caps is becoming absolete, the technology era is officially here. there is not a thing we can't find in @caps that can't be found online.      although the @caps is a government run facility, many people will go elsewhere to find the materials wanted to view the censored media. it is true that if we allowed 'censored' material into a @caps a child could find it. but like the internet you can block things from those kids.     all voices need to be heard, even if it is racist, sexist, biest, or just insane. these are ways to view the persepective or the reason behind hate and war. if we can learn from other mind sets through books, music, movies and movies, then i think we should be aloud to.     nothing should be blocked from the public. every one has the right to voice there own oppinion through there own way.
0.6 whose to say what is appropriate for whom? whose to judge right and wrong for anyone? it depends on a point of view like most things. the sheltered must learn one day, and if kids learn now about the truth, such as, not to stick forks in outlets, then they won't be as curious when they are older. being sheltered is not always a good thing and censor ship of what we read, watch, or listen to is ridculous, and disrespectful to authors.          in matters of censorship, i find it to be pointless. censorship doesn't prevent your kids from learning about anything, except mother won't let me watch that. it just keeps your kids more curious and more obligated to hide things from you and like they cannot ask you questions or be open and honest with you. causes children to go behind your back more and when they're in trouble they'll as if your they're last place where they can ask for help, where you should be they're first resort.         no, i do not believe that libraries should censor anything. its altering a authors work. how would it feel if you had written something and it had been published and was in the library and didn't like something about it so they decided to just bleep it out or not allow certain people to read it? i believe censorship should be illegal not required.          sheltering things from kids prevents them from maturing, and discovering the real world. the idea that the world has no evil, or hiding the evil from your children will in most cases cause them to rebel and in other cases leave them unprepared for the future and the real world. wouldn't you rather be able to help your kids and teach them about things instead of tell them that everything is perfect and only bad people use that kind of language. or make them feel like a bad person for do something your grandparents did when they were young?      i conclude that censorship is injust, unfair, and is the real wrong. not the profanity or the violence that will one day be apart of their life in some way. you don't go through everyday in the 'real world' with a mindset of there's nothing wrong in this world. or everything is censored and everything is controlled  i believe censorship is just another way of controlling the mind through nuture
0.4 newpaper company,@caps am writing to this company on why i think the certain books, music, movies and magazine should be removed form the shelves if they are found offensive. @caps wirting to tell you from my own experience and readings that will convince a argument. @caps reflecting my view on censorship in libraries. @caps writing so you can hear me out on what i have to say and persuasive you on this essay.     first, i think know book should be taking off on any shelf of any library. rather if it was to do with people thoughts on religious, race or any other thing that has been offensive to anyone in the past. for example, gay and lesbian marriage peoples thoughts and opinion on this topic. i beileve that know one should disrespect anyone opinion on what they have to say. it depends on what kind of language your using for this type of subject if its has harsh words and its suppose to be harmful, then yes it should be remove. another thing is children taken books off shelves. maybe you should ascort your child in the child section and telling him or her what they should not do like taking stuff down that they are not suppose to. what i'm saying is if suppose to hurt other and is offensive using negatively words to harm others feelings, it should be remove.      my letter to you was to show you on my opinion on what i think should be in a library or not. i have use some examples and common sense to show you my point of view on what i think is right or wrong in this situation. i hope my topics and argurment has convince you on if you should remove a book from a shelf.                                             @organization
0.6 censorship has become a major topic when it comes to books, music, and movies.  these are being censored because people don't want young kids to read, listen, or watch these materials.  what about the adults?  books, music, and movies being taken off of the shelfs in libraries because of censorship, is not fair to the adults.     books now are being rewriten so they won't have offevsive language in them.  to @caps a @caps is a classic example of this.  changing the offensive language in this book would totally ruin it.  this book is mainly about the racism that whites had towards the african americans, and if that was altered the readers wouldn't get a sense of that racism.  if libraries have books that are censored they should put them on a shelf just for censored books so adults could still be able to read them.     music is another peice of material that censorship has gotten a hold of.  offensive language is being taken out  of songs and uncensored cd's are not being sold in some stores because of censorship.  some adults like the original songs with the original words.  libraries should carry both the explicit and the clean verions of cd's to they some them that are suitable for kids and the ones that adults can listen to.     movies are another peice of material that censorship has taken over.  they are being rated @caps, suitable for all ages, @num, suitable for children @num and older, and rated @caps, suitable for people @num and older.  these rating are good guidelines, but parents should be the ones to make the final decision on whether or not their child should be able to watch a certain movie.  libraries should have all kind of movies on their shelfs.  if a twelve year old kid wants to watch a @num or rated @caps movie, he or she should be able to with the consint of a parent or guardian.     censoship is a good thing but it doesn't need to be taken to the extreme.  if an adult wants to read a censored book, he or she should still be able to read it at their local libary and if a young kid wants to watch a rated @caps movie, he or she should be able to with the consint of a parent or guardian.
0.4 you are not elgible to check out this book', says the libranian. you are just too young for this book.      to me censorship laws in libraries are not needed. the common people should have the liberty to check out what ever they please. the people who make the censorship laws should be pleased that young people actually want to read.     books, music, movies, magazines, etc., are all under censorship. everyonee takes things in differently, being said some are mature than others. if they want to play that game, or read that book they should be allowed. the person who picks up the product should know how they are and should know if they can handle the material. therefore they are held accountable for their actions. isnt that how legal laws are carried out?     if any sort of content is found offensive it still shouldnt be removed from the shelves. something @month seem offensive to one person but someone else @month find that interesting. for example, when the newspaper talks about a specific athlete they @month say things tha offends his?her fans. they people who are not fans of him/her @month find it ammusing; so they should remove the post because some people dont like it. someone @month like that book, music, movie, or magazine dont inconvience them because of a few people.           interest @month vary, but a teen @month like the same type of books as an adult. censorship laws wont  let the teen read the book they likes because of his/her age, and to me that is unfair. it is a new day and age; things have changed from what they once were. cencorship laws should be wiped out completly. if you @month find a book offensive in any way, shape, or form just dont read it. nobody is forcing to read that specific book; libraries are filled up with a numerous amount of books. there is a book out there that you will enjoy.     in conclusion, certain material shouldnt be removed from shelves if found offensive. some other peoople @month like that same aterial. there shouldnt be censorship laws in libraries at all. that is just unfair, and unjust to some people. its a new time and age and things are different. people of any age should be able to check out any book they please
0.4 human beings, like snowflakes, are very much alike in a unique way. just as there are no two identical snowflakes, no two humans are exactly the same. as everyone has their differences, there are always those who have a greater sense of curiousity, and prefer to think outside the box. however, it is difficult for these curious people to extend their strive for knowledge, if they have restrictions as to what they can read or study. therefore, if a person is mature enough, and desires to study or read upon a certain topic at a library, they should be allowed to extend their knowledge on any topic of their choosing, with permission of a gaurdian of course.     unfortunately, it is often times a group of minorities that ruin something for the greater minority. libraries often times take in account a child's age as a factor towards what a they can, and can not read, but age seems completely unfair to a child who is mature enough to read, and handle the more adult rated intell in a fashionable manner. if one is legally eligable, and they have permission from their gaurdian, then he or she should have no restrictions to the materials provided at any library what-so-ever. who is one to say a ten-year-old is too young to learn about @person and his horrible plans for the @caps? a person is never too young, or too old to learn something new, if the curiousity and the proper level of maturity is present!     it is curiousity that has led mankind to discover something new each and every day. as well, it is curiousity that has brought mankind to the extraordinary level of technology, and inventions that it is at today. the youth of the present will one day be the engineers, doctors, scientists, and moving leaders of the future. if these young people are curious, and desire to achieve greater knowledge on a certain topic for positive reasons, then let them be!
0.4 books, music, movies and magazines are all offensive in different ways. they all are some how offensive to people if they have inappropreiate launguage or actions or stories in them. should thease materials be taken off the shelf just because some people think they are to offensive to be on there and they don't want their children getting ahold of them?      when i go to the library i see different sections, fiction, nonfiction, ect. what i don't see is a section marked 'offensive'. librarys don't do that. if parents or anyone don't want their children or any other children reading offensive books they should go with them and make sure they don't pick up offensive books, or have them wait in the childrens area.      librarys usually don't carry offensive music. they have @caps's for books to listen to. that might have offensive lauguage in it.  before renting or buying the @caps you should ask someone who works at the library to tell you if they conscider it offensive or not. if they don't know then don't get the @caps. most of the time you know what your looking for before you go to the library anyways.      if movies are offensice they are marked rated @caps. @num movies are the better ones. if parents or anyone do not want their children watching rated @caps movies before renting or buying one they should check the back where it always tells you. when i was young my mom would always check the back of movies because she didn't want me watching rated @caps movies. she herself thought most of them were too offensive for me to see.     most of the time magazines don't have offensive lauguage in it but they sometimes have inappropreiate pictures of men and women. they also have a bunch of gossip stories you might not want your children to read. but if your letting your children read this then you should read it before they do to make sure for yourself there is nothing you wouldn't want them reading.      i don't think there is any reason to remove books, music, movies, magazines, ect., from the shelves if they are offensive to some. if a parent or anyone else doesn't want their children or anyone else's children to read something they think is offensive they should make sure they read something before they let them read it. also walk around with the child in the library to make sure they don't pick up anything they wouldn't like, or have their child pick things from the childrens section. some people like reading books, magazines some might think are offensive. everyone shouldn't be punished for those who just don't want their children finding offensive things in the library
0.4 we all find things offensive, wether it be in a book, magazine, movie, cd, tv show, or a newspaper article. libraries hold all of those items and somepeople @month or @month not want to remove the items that they think are offensive, but would that be right? if everyone went to the library and took everything that they thought was offensive off the shelves, we would have nothing left.      maybe writers should just cut down on things that are innapropriate, racist, or things that include foul language. then not as many people would be offended and they would not have any problems with letting their children pick out books on their own. although, it @month not be the writers at fault here. it @month be the readers. some people should just stop taking everything so seriously, then they would not have to worry about things like what their children are reading.     yes most adult things now are innapropriate for children, but that's why it is for adults. children have their own selection of books and movies. and parents need to realize that maybe they should take their kids to the childrens section. all types of entertainment are categorized by age and people should start paying more attention to that. if parents started watching what their kids do, then they would not be worrying about the reading or watching something they should not be. that is what parents are for, taking care of their children and some people do not do a very good job of that.     if there is a book you read and it is something you do not want your child to read, it is probably something you read when you were older, so do not worry about it until they get to that age. and maybe then it would be ok of they read it, because they are old enough to realize right from wrong. parents can not always control what their children do. and if they do by chance pick up the book their parents never wanted them to read, they @month see it in a different way than their mother of father did and they @month learn a very valuable lesson from it.
0.4 know you ask me to write an essay to a newspaper reflecting my views on censorship in libraries.  well ok then i will you my not like what i have to say but i really dont care @caps if it was up to your dam goverment to decide what we could say or what we can read or even do. theyd have us all in our house with our hands tied so we couldent learn more then how to eat, clean, and dress our selfs.      now the way i see it is that we have every rite to read any book we please when we whant to read it. now if we dont want to read a book then we dont have to read it. but we as a people and they as a goverment do not have the rite to take your books out of the libraries. now we as a people can press any thing we want @caps no matter what they as in the goverment thinks it is the people who run the stat not the dam goverment.     my point is, is that the books are there to teach us about our lives, our histoy. books teach us about what wrong and what is rite. books are here to give sceary story by a camp fire they are here to give kids a bed time story.  if we take thos books off our shelves you think the kids of your generation are bad just wait @caps the next one will be worse than this one i promise you that.      now it is our rite to save our books, @caps if we do not then us as @caps will be lost. for without book our passed is lost, our fock tales are forgoten, our kids will not be able to sleep at night without there storys.      now come guy as a all pull it together. if you see a book on the shevles and you think its offences then by @caps put the dam thing down and walk away from it dont complane about it. no one told you that you had to read it. so don't ruine it for everyone just @caps eather you dont belive in @caps and you think that the bibles not rite then dont touch. its the same way around if you do bleave in @caps and you think that all book that tell about a witch or vampires or that my even have a hore house in just leave it alone. its just a dam book let us read them. see you guy blame us kids that the vido games roten our minds but realy its the parent that dose @caps see there is nothing more a teenanger like myself loves to do more than to do something there mom or dad says not. so gut just back off and let us read and play and do what in the hell we want to do.
0.6 i do not believe there should be censorship in our libraries. by censoring our libraries, they're censoring us. this is supposed to be a democracy, not a dictatorship.     a good example of censorship that has recently happened is rewriting all the @person books just because they use the 'n word' and some people find this offensive. the thing is, this is how they talked back then, this is just the way things were. people can't just rewrite books because they don't like the history behind them. they can change all they want, but in the end it still happened. we recite history so we don't make the same mistakes again, and this is a good example of it.     music shouldn't be censored. music is a form of expression, and by censoring the music, you're censoring the artist. they say the things they do for a reason and they work hard to create the things they do. we're supposed to have freedom of speech, so now why are we getting these freedoms taken away from us just because a select few deem it inappropriate. we don't make anyone listen to anything they don't want to. each generation has it's own style and music, has it's own problems and ways to deal with them; our generation is music, so let us express ourselves.     movies are censored due to language and content, which i get, but actually removing them from our libraries should not happen. if the audience is mature enough to handle it, they should be able to watch it. we don't need to take out curse words or remove inappropriate scenes just so childern can watch them. if they are really that bad, they don't need to watch them period until they are mature enough to handle it.     magazines should be censored in the same way as movies, by maturity level and age. i agree there are some movies that are inappropriate, but taking out articles just because someone in charge doesn't like what's being said is wrong. we can't just block out all the bad things that are happening in the world and just pretend nothing's wrong because the stories aren't being told. people deserve to know what's going on. people deserve to read, watch, or listen to anything that they want. by censoring things, they're only going to make us search to find them, therefor making it kind of like a reward to get to see the things others find so inappropriate that they're willing to go out of their way to get rid of them.     you can't please everyone, so just elt us make our own decisions. censoring our libraries is like censoring us. we have our constitution, we know our rights, now why are people nowadays thinking they can change them? they can't keep us dumb by hiding things. we're still going to find them, they're just going to make it like a game of tag; so let the game begin
0.6 remain on the shelf?     certain materials such as books, music, magazines and more can often contian offensive information that many would want censored. the people writing the items are not making them so that they are just plain offensive, the way people take in information is the main factor. people choose whether or not to believe certain things for themselves, and with those come their personal opinions. books and magazines should not be removed from shelves if they are found offensive, this could create more problems with the public and those who disagree on what has been taken out, that dont consider them to be offensive.     what is offensive to one person, @month not be offensive to the next. items being removed because of a complaint made by one person should not even be considered. whether it be a book, magazine, or music the author had a purpose for it and it was not intended on hurting someone's feelings. for example, a book about slavery could be offensive to a white man, but a black man would consider it to be about his history. people can find many things offensive by just reading titles, or listening to one lyric from as song, but that does not mean they have to read the book or keep listening to the song. someone else is enjoying the book and the song could be what another person looks forward to everyday.     these magazines and books could also be seen as informing. the material in a certian magazine @month not be acceptable by some, but a lot of new information can come from them. if everything found offensive was removed from the shelves there would most likley be nothing left. removing them could cause choas to someone who is trying to learn more about a disease, when another person who is suffering from it does not want their story told. certian materials being offensive can only offend so many, and chances are what doesnt offend them offends the next person. informing articles and books should not be removed from shelves in libraries because they are there just to provide a source of knowledge.     censoring in libraries would also take away from those who are just interested. a lot of people like to read and rent movies just for fun, but chances are if the book or movie does not sound interesting, it is not going to make any profit. what is considered offensive to a person could be the interest of another. from my experience teenagers are interested in alot of action and romantic films and books. they often times contain alot of physical and sexual content along with a decnt amount of foul language. a older person would not be interested in the foul language and content, they would consider them to be offensive to either the girl or boy in the story and would wonder why it is even being read. most would even say that the books and movies can be degrading to some, but it is what interests teens and makes them want to read more becasue they can't wait to see what is going to happen next. removing items such as these would push teens away from reading and viewing alot of movies because nothing then would spark their interest.     scenes and facts in materials that could be offensive to a person are usually not intended to be. people are not being made to read and watch what offends them. everybody is different and what offends my neighbor @month not offend me. chances are that there will alwasy be something that is going to offend at least one person. the more we all get used to it , the less many people will actually run into items that offend them. they @month still be offended on the insided but it won't matter because they will have realized that not everybody is offended by the same thing
0.6 should materials such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., be removed from shelves if found offensive? censorship can be a huge deal depending on who you ask or where you go some find it necessary so kids do not get into these things found in librarys or some @month not think it's so important.      books are important parts of peoples lives, learning, etc, they are also read for many different reasons but some of the topics books are written about @month not be right or could be innapropriate or possibly against all of someones beliefs or religion. i personally do not think that censorship is necessary to keep some things out of librarys just some thngs shouldnt be available for anyone to just walk in and pick up off of a shelf in a library maybe materials that are innapropriate for children or people @month find offensive should be kept away in a different secluded section of a library and be clearly labeled of what the purpose of this room is so people will clearly know and won't really risk the chance of just stumbling upon those materials.     another reason why censorship @month not be necessary is that things that anyone could find in the library that @month be offensive or innapropriate can be found just as easy if not easier on @caps or on the internet by anyone anytime of the day. @caps has some censorship but not enough to remove the effect that @caps show or movie or internet site could have on the minds of todays young people and children such as violence, drugs, language, and racism that is found in almost everything today. todays children and young people should be taught of whats wrong even if they do think it's dumb or unecassary at the time when they mature they hopefuloly will see whay they were taught those things and why they should always try to stay away from things that are seen in movies, magazines, books, and mostly on @caps and not get involved with these activities.      censorship i still believe is not necessary even though i know of all the innapropriate and harmful things in todays culture. even though i know how harmful it can be if they see the effect it could have on their future and what it has done to other people that saw things in movies, books or even heard it in music if they could see and hear from people who have been affected by these things they would know to stay away from bad things and go along with whats right.     in conclusion censorship is not necessary, it could be in the future but if everyone is lead to what is right they will hopefully make the right decision and stay away from harmful books, movies, music, magazines, and other things alike.
0.4 books now an days have action, romases, and, etc. so that's why the books that are not moving off the shelf is because they don't have what other books have. so they just sit there well most of the other books that are getting off the shelf are the happy @caps, the @caps side, the @caps,and all of the vampor books. it's because they have action, love, and etc.     the books that are on and off the shelf. are maybe really good books. some books don't ever leave the shelf it's probably because they are not. really that great the reason for it is because the books that are on the shelf is. because the book is  boring, or a old school book, they really don't have what the raeder is looking for. however the books that are really getting readers happy are the books that are from the movies like the @caps side. that book has gotten sold faster than the movies.     the reason why readers like the books more than the movies is because. the books from the movies like the @caps side. is bacuse the author gives more informotion on the movie. i heard that, that book is nothing like the movie the book is so much better than the movie because the book gives more informotion on the movie. so their for poeple really like books that from a movie.     they are more reasons why poeple like books now and days. you don't have to go to a book store anymore the books are now on your iphone, ipod, itouch,ipad and a nook,etc. so now you dont have to go to a book store anymore. you can get it on you iphone and other stuff poeple are raelly happy that they dont have too get up in the morning or when ever they get they books. they can however now just get them on the go.     so that is why books are now on the shelfs for good. because you can get it on the go. but i believe that poeple whom ever like the feel of book. should try and  just go out and get a iphone or nook something thaat saves you time while you are on your way to work or school
0.4 dear @caps,     @caps the world there are people who censor what their people read and write, these works are oftenly produced by communist and socialist governments. here in @location we have the right to say,read, and write what we want,about anybody or anything. censoship does exist in the @location, and it is in the form of opoion that it exists.     i have read artricles in the paper about how text books have covered up the truth,due to what is politicaly correct. i have heard of libaries taking down books that have a very strong political opoion, often these are books written by conservitives.i have read about books coming out with the only intention of slamming,proabable presidential nomanees. being a conservitive myself,i do not believe that these books should not be in book stores,libaries, or other public venues.     i believe this because in @location we have freedom of press and,for these books not to reach the public is against that right and,the free-flow of ideas.you @month ask way i believe this? i believe this because i too want others to hear and read about my ideas, on how to obtain life,liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.      now that @person, is why all books should be in our libaries.i agree with a restricted section where certain books should be stored,so little children will not get a hold of @num i would like this paper to put an article out about these thoughts. we the @organization are a republic,and we for over @num years have encouraged the free-flow of ideas.why stop now?thank you @person
0.6 as a fellow person of the community and a person who often vists the libray, i think that books,magazines,movies,etc., should not be taken off the shelf. the reason for this thought is because, although it @month be offensive to one person does not mean it's offensive to another. taking various books and items away from our libraries takes away from many peoples' knowledge of our world. this in turn makes the world illiterate.     libraries provide multiple things that are not family disscreation but, to the right age group offers alot of knowledge. movies are a large portion of this problem but, they are there do to entertainment  reasons. i feel that all items that are equipped in a library should be looked at as a way of knowledge and not as weither it is offensive to a certain quanity of people. the removal of these things @month become harmful to a new generation in the long run.     i personally think as a person who attends the library often, that things being taken away cause uproar in different ways.  i have read multiple books that have been aquired from all different sections of the library. some even pertainig to racism of my own ethinticity that uses words that are not to my liking. i tolerate with the words do to the fact that i would like to know what my ancestory had to do in order for me to get where i am today.             magazines are also a small portion of this conflict. as like movies though they are there to provide entertainment. most people like to use the library for a time of relaxtion. the library is not just there for people to take books and other things it also there so that people can have a comfortable place to learn something.      in conclusion, as a fellow person of the community and a frequent library attende, i think that things should not be taking off of shelves. libraries provides various things that are not at a family disccreation level but, @month provide help to other people. some books pertain to racism of ethnitcity. it's not meant to be harmful but to show what your ancestor had to endure to get your where you are. things like magazines are there for your entertainment and if you think it's inappropriate then you should'nt read or watch it.
0.8 as @caps, we are entitled to both freedom of speech and freedom of the press.  however, these rights are somewhat suppressed in the censorship of media at libraries.     i can understand why libraries feel that they need to ban certain works; there are many children that frequent libraries, and having explicit content could deter parents from allowing them to visit.  surely, though, the media in question could be placed in a seperate area, off-limits to anyone under a certain age.  even if someone gets their hands on one of these works, safeguards could be used at the front desk to keep them from borrowing the material.  their library card would show their age, and the worker would not allow them to check out the work if they were too young.     furthermore, i trust in people's common sense.  if they believe that a book or movie will be too adult for them, they will avoid checking it out of the library.  parents, as well, will surely not allow their children to borrow risque material.  information is open to those that search for it, and the knowledge it brings prevents unwanted results.     there are those that want this content banned because it does not conform to their morals, but this is really just setting restrictions on other's freedoms.  they @month think it is too explicit, but another @month not.  that other person might want to use the material, but because of restrictions set by the first person, the borrowing of the work becomes prohibited.  it seems that if the first doesn't agree with the material, they could just let it be, and not bring others into the dispute.  people know their limits and generally make sure they don't cross them.     i think this conflict represents the @caps way of life in itself.  when a disagreement arises, no matter what the topic, one group of people wants to basically control what everyone else can or cannot do.  they organize protests, sign petitions, etc. true, people do protest laws, and with good reason.  however, there really is no need to argue over petty issues that could easily be avoided if people were to just use common sense to reach a consensus.  i think this censorship issue is a prime example of that.     when it comes to these kinds of debates, we need to learn that we can't be too quick to place restrictions; that we should leave others to do what they think is best for themselves.  the best course of action is to leave others alone concerning simple things such as this, and to avoid placing any restrictions on anyone's works, rights, and freedom.  to paraphrase @organization, i @month not agree with what you say, but i will fight to the death your right to say it.
0.4 i believe certain materails such like books, music, movies, and magazines are offensive and are inappropiate.      why i believe @caps is because there are things that are in these items that hurt people in many ways. but when the people make and read these items they dont know how effective it is to the people that are buying these items from the maker. i also had experience a offensive book and a inappropiate book.      when i went to a public libary i picked up @caps book and said too my self ' @caps might be a good book i can do for my book report' so as i picked up the book and flip threw the pages i saw words and images that offened me.there was words that where calling color people out by there names and pictures of the color women getting rape or abuse.      so i did not get that book i just put it back and was mad at the people that treated my culture wrong. so @caps white lady 'the libraryan' came up to me and asked me did i need help finding anything, but i did not answer her i just looked at her and shook my head.     as i walked threw the library i saw inappropiate books such as '@caps books' that these kids was looking at i could not believe what i was seeing. becasue i think they should have these books some where else so that the younger kids will not get to these adult books including the music that always talk about @caps, drugs, and gangs. because i think these things are bad for the younger kids to be looking at or listing to because it can effect there futrure in life and also can cause violence, abuse, harrasment stuff that will get our younger childern in trouble as they get older.     i think all public libraries should have @caps type of stuff kept in a section for adults only and have to show some type of i.d to prove you are @num and older.
0.4 offensive much? thats what multiple people feel towards curtain books. for instence if @caps was the bible and you were an athiest, or a person who doesn't believe in god, then the bible @month be offensive and hurtfull to you. i feel as a student that there are so many people in the world that by the time everyone inserts their own feelings by taking away books then we would have nothing left to read. you see, everyone is different in their own way, so books, magazines and music wouldn't be around because everyone feels differently about different subjects. i feel that they are a resourse that is very helpfull, and multiple times knowledgeable on many grasping subjects.      first, besides books, we have magazines. if we would get rid of all of the magazines in the world then there would be a cut down on all those horrible advertisements that men long for. second there would be less gossip. most magazines are about @percent gossip about the recent break-ups, and make-ups, of todays modern celebritys. i feel that the magazines are a waste of time because they hurt peoples feelings, also its offensive the way that some famous people act. i strongly believe we should take magazines off the shelves.     lastly there is music. some of the greatest inspiration comes from music. don't you remember the song, 'we @caps't @caps the @caps?' @caps if you don't then i'll tell you a little about @caps. @caps's about america, things that have happened in the past and were a big deal. in the chorus @caps says, '-we @caps't @caps the @caps,- but we tried to fight @caps. @caps's always been burning since the worlds been turning.' @caps's a song that is about americans saying that they @caps't cause panic and such things, but that since the begining of time @caps already was. the song inspired many of the famous singers you @caps know. elvis @caps is one of the many that you should know. we should keep music out so people, like me, who have been inspired, can inspire others. music helps the blind, heals those who are sick, and give hope to americans. without mucis there would be chaos.     last and furthermore is movies, where would we be without movies? we need movies, not just for our intertainment, but some of the best movies are historical events. events that help us get a better grasp and keen look at what has happened in the past. for instince the movie @caps, and @location, even the movie the @caps @caps, they all help us picture events that have happened and are very enjoyable but also very educational. we should keep movies, there is no doubt in my mind.     in conclusion i hope i have created a clear message that you will take into consideration highly. we need books and music to inspire and electrify the world, and magazines we need not. we all need a little inspiration in our down spiraling lives, and we need education. not the kind that we wish to see but the kind we need to see. i hope i have made a positive inpact on your thoughts, and feelings.
0.4 books have been around for hundreds and hundreds of years. they have significent value in culture, lives, and everything else. we all see kids laughing and enjoying books about pretty ponies and little puppies. what we don't see is how books and magazines are really effecting people of different race, religion, or age. we should take a stand and get rid of these bad books. negitive books, movies, and magazines should be taken off the shelf to prevent hurt feelings and ideas.      we have learned to accept everybody no matter what color they are. i remember in @num grade when a girl named @person got very upset because she thought a book was making fun of her skin color. everyone in the book was white and excluded a african american girl from playing with them because she wasn't pretty enough. she went to tell the teacher and the teacher threw the book away and said that we should all learn to treat everyone with respect no matter what they look like. we need to have more books like what the teacher was trying to teach us. to boost everyones spirits and make them feel better about themselves. the world has changed and books should too.      many things influence people of different ages, race, or religion. books that talk bad about other religions or make you second guess your faith are considered negitive and should be taken off the shelf. how would you like it if someone was putting down your religion? that is how many people feel when reading that kind of material. these books, magazines, and movies are not good for anybody and should not be anywhere near libraries.      have you been watching what your kids are reading about or what movies they are watching? most of childrens books and movies have pretty princesses and little mermaids but not all of them. behind some movies or books there is are violence and bad scenes. when fight scenes occur and zombies attack, children believe that everything is real and that it is ok to kill someone if they are a bad. boys believe that it is ok to hurt people because that is what happens in the movies. girls believe that everything about a princess is perfect and flawless and to be a princess they also have to be flawless. do we really want childrent to think it is ok to fight and be upset because they are not perfect? libraries need to get rid of these book and movies because it is badly influencing the children in the world.      not all books are bad and not all of them are good, so we need to divide and conquer. we need to take a closer look and really examine what needs to be taken off the shelves. the books, magazines, and movies that influence people to think differently about themselves need to go away for good. to get rid of these books that cause conflict within a person is like getting rid of a big burden. it can make a really big improvment in adults and children. please take negitive books and movies off the shelves to prevent any unnecessary problems!
0.4 books @caps @caps @caps      @caps your in a library its many book that children decide to read that @month not be suited for their @caps. many parents allow their kids to read those type of books so they're use to it now. but some book aren't for children @caps.     now and days kids are more mature and knowledgeable and can read on higher levels. @caps kids go to the library they look for book that catch their attention. some books that are out shouldn't be out and thats my opinion. most authors write about things such as sex, drugs, and other bad thing. @caps a child looks at things like that they get ideas about what the book is talking about and try those things they read. im not saying that all kids read books and decide to try all the things that they read, but most will.     some kids minmic off certain things they hear, see and even read. kids are always going to look up to other people so what they see you do they will try to do it. i beleive that things like books that kids should'nt read should be put away. books should be taken off the shelves and put in places where only adults could get them. just like video games only a certain age group could play the game because of the things they do in the game. the things kids see they soon try out. they should also make it where you rate a book like you rate movies, video games and other things. all books aren't bad for children @caps but some are.      i notice that many parents don't care about what their kids read as long as they're reading. people should'nt think that way  because its alot of crule people in this world. i even seen on the news where it was an author who wrote a book about how he killed a lady. so many teens read that book and found it interesting. and it even gave young boys ideas about killing people or girl friends. that book should be in the hands of someone with a mature mind that really knows right from wrong. its parents out in this world that wouldn't allow their kids to read books that have bad things in them. most parents find it offensive that book stores or other places sell these type of books to their children. the things authors talk about in their books and what they include no @caps should read.     books that aren't good for certain age groups or that have inaproprate things in it should be removed from the shelves. but certain people interpret the words different and veiw it different. its many books out in this world that most parents or grandparents hope their kids or grandkids never take off the shelf. but its going to keep going on until someone speaks up.
0.8 author katherine paterson once commented, ' all of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. but if i have the right to remove that book from the shelf-- that work i abhor-- then you also have exctly the same right and so does everyone else. and then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us'. many people in society share katherine's view, while some belive in strict library censorship. it is important not to infringe on the rights of other people, surpress freedom of speech, or limit their knowledge. therefore, i support her sentiment. if materials are thought to be innnapropriate for children ,or others for that matter, then censorship needs to be set up in the home by the parents, not by a public institution.      america was founded upon the need for freedom: freedom of speech, of religion, and press. if we start to change that or limit what press a library can or cannot have, we are destroying a nation's core values. can we turn our back on what our forefathers knew we had the right to? furthermore, if we start to take a few 'offensive' books off the shelf, where do we draw the line? anybody can claim almost any book is 'offensive' in some way, shape, or form, that does not mean we should immeadiatly take it off the shelf of an important public institution. if you do not want to take my word for it, look back at histroy. what kind of civilization was @location? not one you would want to live in i suppose. hardly anyone would, and one of the things they controlled most was personal freedom. they started it off with the seemingly small act of censoring books. first, it was just viewed as unsavory to have a book they deemed offensive, in this case it was the works of @caps, @caps-@caps, or @caps authors. later on they started to burn theese books, and punish people for having them in thier possesion. if we are to live in a country, where a man has the rights he should have, then we cannot censor library books. this seemingly harmless act could have much greater consequnces than foreseen.      many families have different values they want to pass on to their children, morals they hope to teach them. the problem is, is that each families' limits and values are unique; we cannot just assume anything about families in general. i personally know a family that is very protective over what their children read, watch or listen to. on the other hand, i am aquainted with a family who allows their children more freedom to choose what they read. what one set of parents want to limit their child from reading @month vary from another set of parents. if they find material they do not want their children to read, then they should censor in the home. they could start with a disscusion about why the material is inapropriate, and give the child the responsibility to obey their parents. it helps the parents become more involved in their childrens' lives and it aids the children in personal growth with responsiblity and respect.      in the end, it all boils down to freedom. do we want to live in a counrty with freedom of press and the right to publicly access it. my answer is yes, and i belive it is the answer of my fellow @caps too. we cannot clearly draw the line between 'offensive' and 'okay' because we are all different. therefore we cannot bring our opinions down on the public instituion, but the home. it is not right to limit a whole society on what they have public access to because of one opinion.
0.6 many people have different views and opinions on things. no opinion or view is right or wrong. books, music, and movies of controversy shouldn't be removed from shelves because not everybody finds them offensive, people have the right to view them, and others can't make the desicion for everyone.     everybody is entitled to their own views and opinions, but they can't make others see things their way. if someone was at a library, and thought the '@caps @caps' series were offensive, they might be the only ones to think that. they can't tell the library to remove them because they're uncomfortable with the books. things go by majorty rule, and that person is not the majorty. they're the only one with the problem.     everyone has the right to view or listen to what they want, as long as it's legal. if someone finds a type of music that they find offensive, they can't tell the store to remove it. one person can't change everything to fit their needs. they would be making plenty of people unhappy if that type of music was removed. to make everyone happy, the person could just not listen it. there's a huge selection of music a person could listen to, without being uncomfortable.     one person cannot make the desicions for everyone. the president doesn't even make the desicions by himself; he has the government helping him. if one person felt as if a magazine was inappropriate, they don't have the right to change it. they're not the one in charge so they can't be the one to change the magazine. it might be inapprpriate, but other people enjoy reading it.      i believe that everyone's entitled to their own opinions and views, but they shouldn't make everyone see it their way. books, music, movies, and magazines are few of the things that people try to control because they're uncomfortable with the subject inside the material. some of the stuff is inappropriate or offensive, but one person can't change it. not everybody will find it offensive, people have the right to view, watch, or listen to what they want, and one person can't make desicions for everyone
0.6 have you ever went to a library and found that some books arn't really the best choice for younger kids to be reading? well i am about to write a persuasive essay explaining what i think is best for younger children to be reading.          i have went to multiple libraries and found that some books, magazines, and movies are way to extreme for kids to be reading/watching. i personaly think that children who arn't above @caps years old shouldn't be exposed of rated @caps or @caps @num books, movies, or magazines. children shouldn't have to know what adult movies, books, or magazines should look like at the age @num. what i think kids should watch or read are @caps movies and books.           some of you are probly like 'but it's not like there going to know what it means.' @caps if children don't know what something means then that deffinantly won't stop them from saying it. children learn by hands on or watching other things. they will eventually ask what does this mean or mommy what does this word mean. no parent is ready to tell there child at the age of three what a four letter word means. if you are one of the few parents that don't know how to explain things to your child then thats when you can bring out the older books/movies. but don't let them read it on there own. usually kids will start asking about more adult things when the hit the age @caps and up. thats when you as a parents can start letting them read and watch older movies and books.          tweleve years old is still a pretty young age for a kid to be reading and watching older movies on there own. thats when you as a parent can sit down next to them and explain what is going on. as a kid we look up to our parents. we learn from seeing what you guys do. that is the exact same thing as reading and watching movies that are way to extreme for us at the age of ten. at the age of sixteen then usually kids are fine on there own they know what to expect. they know what is happening and they know how to handel it.           in conclusion i think that rated @caps books, magazines and movies should be kept above ages one-@caps. i think that kids will be better off learning about things that they need to know by the time middle school starts. then once they hit highschool they will already know about what becoming an adult is all about
0.4 did your child ever bring home a book? a piece of music, movie or magazine? did you ever stop to think that the piece of information that your child was bringing home could be offensive to someone else?     there are points in time where there isn't an answer to that question and you dont want to chose yes or no. the driving question is do you want to remove books, music, movies and magazines from the shelf, just because a parent thinks that its not fit for a child to be reading. katherine paterson said 'all of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shel. but if i have the right to remove that book from the shelf, that i work abhor, then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. and then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' @caps point in this quotation is that if you take a book off the shelf everytime that someone doesnt think that its right for children to see, then there will be no books left to see.      in agreement to katherine, parents @month want the best for their children, but there are reasons to why you should agree with the average parent and then there are reasons to why you shouldn't. there are books out amongst the world that only adults should see, and their are also books out there that are way too advance to be read by children. these books are all made for a reason and have there own purpose on why they are put there. parents have to sit back and think of their children and then think of the rest of the world, its a big world and you cant just take things away from it. no matter how much you want to protect a child from the point of seeing the books that are meant for older age ranges, there isnt a way that you can stop it.      i think that books are there for whatever reason they were written for. there is no reason that because one person doesn't agree with the way that someone has written that book, it should be taken off the shelf just for that child. libraries cant just start taking books off the shelf for individual mothers that dont like this or dont like that. many people come from many different areas and see things in a different perspective, they dont know the difference between right and wrong.      it's a bigger world out there than you and me. when one person tries to stand against the world, they're going to get knocked down. so why fight when the world was meant to be at peace?
0.4 censorship, only for the light hearted.      we have had this issue for as long as man can remeber. since we were only little kids to adults. everything was censored. bleeps on the television to hide harmless words to random letters in curse words as if we did not know for example what @numk spelt. i agree, censorship is needed for a certain period of time, but when that time goes on for to long and even in books and newspapers to limit what we can handle, that's when it goes out of hand.      i am a highschool student and even i have to say limiting our reading because a book might have one or two bad words in it is just redicoulous. its the most hipocritical thing to do because even science and anatomy books show certain parts of the body like genitalia but thats okay because its in a science book. however if its in a normal book, everythings a big deal and we can't handle it big woop. i say its a library, let us read what we want to read.     like i said before highschool is where the maturity hits and the censorship should be lowered. im not saying just completly take it away but come on now i think highschool student can handle a few bad words in an outstanding book.      as far a movies and music go, anything pornographic or just plain idiotic and demeaning should ofcourse be censored, but if theres just a few bad words why should that stop an entire school from enjoying some good music and possibly an amazing movie.      so the point is, let there be censorship, but only to the point where people wont just take away music and books from us highschoolers for a few bad words. censorship is for the lighthearted, and nothing is stopping the lighthearted people from not picking up that book with a few words in it they don't like, just dont read it. thats all i have to say about censorship.
0.4 the libraries have to worrie about enough as it is with people not retuning books and stuff in. they do not want to lose there books, music, movies, magazines just because some people find the offensive. why would we have to talk something out that offens one person but no one else has complainded about it being offensive. i know that you are asking me to thank like you to be able to see why it is offensive but i dont see how a book is going to be offensive.     when someone finds something that looks offensive then they do not have to take. there are people out there would would read something that is offensive to them so that they can lern from it. there is no reason why if you dont like the libary that you can not go to a differnt one. there is no reason for you to have to get so offensive of books because the authors is just trying to get their point accross and expressing their feeling on the subject.     the way that i look at it is that you have two oppions. the frist being deal with it and go to the libary and get books. the second is dont go to the library if your going to be able to find something offensive. but know if you pick the second one then you must realize were ever you go you are going to find some thing the will make you feel offensive so your might as well just get over it and say yea i will go because its all around me. yes i know what you must be thinking why if its not a big deal then why dont you just take them out. well you want an answer and i will give you one. those books mayne you don't want to read them. but what if someone eles does its not fair to get reed of something just because afew people find it offensive know is it?     there for i say that no we are not going to take books, music, movies, magazines and anything eles out of the libraries. you will just have to deal with what you dont want in here its not like were going to make you read something that you take offensive to. we will not going to get reed of the books, music, movies, magazines or anything else that we the library has. that is why everything that is in the library is staying in the library
0.2 i dont think so becuase what if that is all the person likes to read.  they could put all the bookes in to diffrent sections so that littel kids wont be learning words they shouldnt know wright now.  the librarian could also make it where you have to be a sertaint age to cheak out a book.      there are a bunch of ways to orginze them in to sectoins like make a kids section, a teenager section, and even an adult section. but i dont think the should take the out of the libary for good, becuse there are a lot of good books with some bad words in them. just becuase ther are some bad words in abook does not mean the book is bad
0.6 can literature, which is the basis of civilization, be censored?  can you take these ideas away from those who wish to think them?  i think not, for it would be a futile endeavor to even attempt. to keep something as important as written word away from the culture of the people, would be one of the highest crimes against humanity and could not rightly be condoned, in my mind.      not only would this attempt be a futile (for the people know ways to extract information) it would be downright idiotic of the 'administration' to do so.  i will concede that there are explicit materials out there that are not suitable for children or even adolescents, but that is where the parent should step in by setting guidelines and positive examples which their children feel the need to follow.  not feel that they 'have' to, but feel that they 'need' to.  if parents cannot take control and decide what is appropriate for their children, then in my mind, they are not doing their first and foremost job as a parent that is to protect the child.  some @month say that the censorship of culture is protecting the children, but i say that this is not so.  i believe censorship is a lousy excuse so that parents and upper government officials have to do less work.     if every piece of written, filmed, or recorded work, that was offensve only one person, was thrown out on that basis, there would be none.  there has never been a piece of literature, film, or music that has not offended someone in some way, whether it be spiritually, ethnically, or morally.  the fact is that people cannot exist without strife and misery, and whatever people can do to cause that strife and misery, they will.   people find all sorts of ways to do it, whether it be war, discrimination, media, or just downright obstinance, they will find a way to offend their selected party.     i personally am appalled at the aspect of censorship, for if a person cannot speak his mind, then is he more than a mindless homunculi?  created and controlled by the government surrounding him.  made their slave through ignorance.  if in a society i  cannot say what i need to say then i do not wish to live in that society, for it is nothing but a horrible image of civilization.     in short i do not believe that libraries should be censored, rather that parents should pay more attention to their children and dependents.  if a person is offended by a certain thing, then it is their absolute right to not take part in whatever it @month be, but these afflicted peoples have absolutely no right to say what i @month or @month not read!  if this offends anyone, then i apologize, but at least you knew enough (through your education by media) to be offended and not just another mindless sheep
0.6 in the @location @date, there consists of many libraries that are available to the public with an interminable amount of information. all of this information gives us many opportunities in life to discover new courses and paths to take. byt what if some of this information has a bad influence in our world? what if some of this information changed the persective of peoples' lives, and who people are? libraries do contain offensive and provokative books, movies, and other things that can possibly be hurtful to the behavior standpoint of all human beings. censorship in libraries should be established and set because the people in the @location come from many different places making the @location very diverse. one thing in a book @month not be offensive to one individual although it could be for someone else. magazines, movies, books, etc. should be examined and determined whether it is appropriate for people at certain @caps whether by building a child section for books and movies and such, or having knowledgable assistance to help what people are looking for.     sections in libraries organizes the library providing and easier access to where things are located. in libraries, there are search engines to help people find information in a particular location. the benefit of having sections divided depending on people's @caps is that it seperates the mature section from the immature section appose to having both in one. children normally have a seperate section for children books while older and more mature adults or teenagers have a section to gather their important information from. an example of a bad situation would be if their was a book located in the childrens section that spoke about drugs and alcohol. the children that scrutinized that book would be confused because they do not understand what drugs and alcohol are. they could learn bad things about it and children tend to think they are invisible drawing them to try anything or everything that could possibly be life-taking. this is common sense. sections in libraries do help establish a sense of organization, although personal assistance would be helpful as well.     personal assistance and help on finding information in libraries is very helpful although they must be mature, understand, and know that their are books in libraries that could be about offensive material. asssistance can help us determine if the person that is looking for information about something and there is inappropriate stuff inside the book, the assistant can let the person know about it. because there is an interminable amount of information, i believe that there will be books left on the shelf for many people to learn about. everytime i visit a library, there are always books on the shelves, and when i ask for assistance, they help me find what i am looking for. they warn me about offensive or provokative imagery and such and help me with upmost respect. assistance can help prevent any sort of confusion with books, movies, etc. assistants are ready to help people find what they are looking for and warn the people and are knowledgable about the offensive things that are in each book, movie, etc.      personally, i believe that freedom of speech comes into play in libraries. writers and authors write about information that is fact or also opinion, and typically people learn about subjects that people enjoy or want to discover. censorship in libraries is necessary to let people know about it, although assistance do not have the right to not let anyone read a particular book because it is inappropriate or provokative. everyone in the @location has the right to read whatevery they please. some measures must take place for example towards minors because otherwise it could lead to issues or disasters, but there should not be a law that prohibits a child from reading something. there is no such thing as a book that should be thrown out because every word that comes out out of peoples' mouthes are useful no matter how rediculous it is. even if it is the most rediculous thing you ever heard, that particular person that said something made you think about it and that thought process helped you make a decision in your life that was next to come. this would be more on opinion based writing. in factual righting, it is something that remains in peoples' heads and is saved into the brain like a word document. this document that is saved can be changed and saved again even if the knowledge is offensive. offensive factual information is hurtful to some although it is fact meaning it happened or is true.this brings me to my persepective on the matter that i think there should be a sense of censorship within reason although everyone has the right to read whatever they please because there is a never ending amount of information in the world and that information, including opinion, would make the shelves be empty from books
0.6 what would you say if your library  was censored? would you believe it would be right to have a censorship at the library? well i am here to explain my belief's on censorship in the library.     my opinion is that there should be some items being censored, but we dont want to punish everybody just by taking the books off of the shelf completely. if i was an adult i would not want my child renting very graphic books, magazines, etc. but i wouldn't want to block his whole life. there can be different censorship on individual people too. an idea is to have a parent come in to decide what type of censorship you can put on a child by putting this on his or her library card.      the censorship would be a great way to help parents watch what their children are reading and watching. a good suggestion for this is what i just brought up, a personal censorship. this would keep the child from reading too graphic of novels for their age and it would not offense the parents. also for the rated x magazines, movies, etc. i believe they shouldn't be took off the shelf and just moved to a different area that is secluded. this can be offensive to parents when they bring their children in, so move it to a place where children cannot have access to this area.     the censorship on books can also be completely outrageous too. alot of books have graphic parts in them but yet are also a great read and can have great morals to learn. graphic parts of the books are like the graphic parts of our lives, it's going to happen no matter what and we can't get away from it. let the child, teenager, or whoever it is read the book if they are mature enough to read this and don't take it off the shelf. just because it is offensive to some, others want to read the book too. you @month please some with this idea but you will also anger others with this action.     another point to get across is the library is also censored a little bit too. the libraries are organized into section by categories of books. some books are categorized by the age level they are intended for. once you get into the actual novels it isnt much like this but for younger ages this is the case, which people can see it work as a censor in ways. when you become to the higher reading level, you are most likely going to be old and mature enough to pick what you think is right to read and what is not.      with all this being said, there really doesnt need much censorship in libraries. unless you have the personal censorship on the younger ones. there is no need to punish the ones that did absolutely nothing wrong to the community and to others when all they want to do is to simply check out items at the library
0.6 everyone has their favorite music they listen to or their favorite book to read even if it does offend a certain group or type of people. people do still read or listen to it. and the people who write the books or write the lyrics for a song are just expressing themselves. i believe that anything offfensive should'nt be censored because it's a way that people can express themselves.     i listen to music all the time as long a i like the way it sounds. it doesn't really matter to me what the lyrics say and im pretty sure that goes for alot of people. but there are some songs out there that people feel they can relate to so they actually listen to what the song is saying.     i don't really read alot because im picky about the books that i do read. that's not the case for everyone though. alot of people like to read because it makes them feel like the book takes them to a different world. it's an escape for them from everyday life. which i can understand why someone would want to escape.     movies are like books but you get a visual of whats going on. which makes it more entertaining than a book. so more people would rather watch a movie. but the movies don't have all the details that the book has so the books are more fulfilling. and just because someone doesn't like a movie doesn't mean that there isn't someone out there who does because there is.     so my conclusion is that everyone is different they like different things and dislike different things. but just because someone doesn't like something doesnt mean that someone else wont like it. like i said everyone is different. so why can't the materials they read or watch be different as well?
0.6 freedom to chose is something every person can have, such as what type of clothes you wear.  censorship in libraries should not be allowed because everyone should have that right to chose.  plus, there are other ways to avoid children getting inappropriate books besides taking the books completely out of the library.  censorship in libraries should not happen because if someone is eighteen, they should have the right to chose what they want to watch anyways, the parents can censor what books and movies they want there kids to read and see, and there are offensive things and inappropriate things on television that everyone has access to as well.     first of all, if a person is eighteen they should have a right to read whatever books they chose because they are grown adults.  eighteen year olds can go into rated @caps movies which would be about as bad as a book most likely.  in our society, people that are eighteen can do almost whatever they chose because they have freedom.  for example, adults can look up whatever they chose on the internet, and so can everyone else of all ages.  so, if they wanted to read a book like that, they could probably get it off the internet, even if they can not in libraries.  therefore with today's technologies, censorship would not make a difference.     next, there are ways to avoid children reading inappropriate books besides taking the books off the shelves completely.  for instance, if parents are so worried about their children reading inappropriate books, then they should take their kids to the library themselves and tell their kid what they can and can not read.  if parents do not censor what their child reads, then those parents @month want the child to read whatever he/she choses to.  if their parents chose to let their kid read the book, then that is their choice, not anybody elses.  the choice for what book the child reads should be between the parent and the child.     lastly, there are so many things in the world that could be offensive to other people besides a book.  for example, people offend other people all the time by words they say.  people hear about all of the fighting because the person probably was offended by something someone else said.  also there is the television.  the television has inappropriate shows on it all the time, yet everyone can have access to it if they chose to.  plus there are shows on television that could have to do with racism, or someone being overweight.  these things offend people every day.  therefore, we should not take books off the shelves just because there is a possiblity of offending someone, when a person could be offended by so many other things in the world rather than a book.     in conclusion, the books, magazines, and movies of the library should not be taken off the shelves away from the public just because they are not appropriate for some children.  eighteen year olds are adults who should be able to chose whatever they want.  plus if parents are worried about their child reading inappropriate books, then they can monitor that themselves.  also, people are offended every day by other people, so books, magazines, and movies are not the only things in the world that could be offensive.  if the person thinks a movie or book is offensive to them, then do not check it out!  not everything in our lives has to be controlled by someone, so people should lighten up and give some freedom of choice.
0.6 the thought that katherine paterson had in her quote is quite understandable. if we were to censor books then there would be nothing to read in libraries. if you really tried, in every book you could find something offensive. i somewhat agree with her; however, i do believe there should be rules on where books are located.     books are ment to be read and taking them away would be horrible for every book loving person in this world. there are some things about where the books are to be found in the library that is up to dabate. personally, i believe the childrens books should be on the opposite side of the building from the adult books and other reading material. in doing this you, for the most part, prevent the children from entering an area that is not age appropriate.     teenage reading material should be seperate from both childrens books and adult reading material. in this way they are not around the material that is 'above their heads', so to speak. if this were done parents' minds could be put at rest for the time being. they would not have to worry about their child or teenager finding reading material that is inappropriate or offensive.     books that some people find offensive should be catigorized, such as '@caps @caps'. they should also be catigorized as '@caps', '@caps', or 'other'. in doing this most times where someone would have been offended are prevented from happening. although there will be times where people will still find those books, and @month be offended, @caps is manditory that we do our best to limit those times. all necissary precautions should be taken.      at the same time we should not remove any books from the shelves that are offensive to some. in removing a book from a shelf we would be eliminating a piece @caps or even life long lessons that are difficult to teach without experiencing them yourself. books offer us as humans so much, from @caps to entertainment to even a form of comfort. books are important to everyone whether they realize @caps or not. we have much to learn from books and we have much to offer our future members of the human race though books.     i do support katherine paterson's belief in that removing books from libraries would destroy the purpose of having them around. at the same time i believe there are ways to limit the times where people would be offended by something. removing books would destroy countless years of @caps, past thoughts, and past expeiences. books should never be removed from libraries just because they @month be found inappropriate.
0.4 i certainly don't believe books, magazines, etc.. should be taken off the shelves in libraries just because they're offensive to a certain amount of people. for one of the reasons are in the @caps @caps it states that you have the freedom of speech and when you write a book or an article in a magazine you are writing a story on whatever you want and if it is put on a shelf in the @caps place it should stay there. also, just because it is offensive to one certain group or person doesn't give anybody the right to take something off the shelf in the library because the author is speaking what they want.     also in magazines today there are many offensive things to certain people such as celebrities, sports stars, etc... but they don't go to the libraries and take them off the shelf. if you were one of those people that did take a book or magazine off the shelf i think you should ask other people what they think about that material, because some people @month like it. also if you keep taking all the books off the shelf what will we have to read and educate ourselves about today, and read stories that were told for generations? if you do see one of those reading materials and they are offensive to you just put it back up on the shelf; and act like you never picked it up.
0.4 i think that censorship in libraries is and is not a good idea because some people wouldnt get to read what they want to. i read world war @caps books, and a wide selectionof others and if they take those away just for being offensive id have nothing to read. if i find a book i think is offinsive i just put it back and dont get it.     i think they should age books like this book is for ages @num, and especialy movies and magizines because kids dont need to read or see certain things, because books and movies sometimes refer to drugs or alcohole and murder. i dont think music is a big deal because music isnt very influincial but music videos are soometimes bad. movies sometimes go to far though and i wouldnt want my kids watching them, so i wouldnt mind if they take thos off the shelves if they are offinsive.i dont think books should be taken off the shelf because parents should know what there kids are reading anyway. i would at least check the book or magazine before geting it for my kids and so should other parents.theres always going to be offinsive books and movies so its the parents job to make sure there kids dont get thos kinds of books or magazines.
0.4 censorship @caps: @caps paper     do i believe the certain materials, such a book,music,movies,magazines,ect., should be removed from the shelves if the are found offensive.my opinion is the if some one wants to write a magazines or a book is okay because the are giveing there opinion know some people just have to say what they believe and some to fight for what they want not just censorship has there fight every one has one.     some materials like music,movies and magazines need to be censor because the kids how go to the libraries kids who are like @num @num grade or maybe smaller then that. we need to clean the libraries from thigs the kids are not old enough to see or to hear.libraries are a place to study and to read a good book or maybe a magazine we have to censor the bad languge and the bad pictures. this can be very offensive for some parents beacuse the @month talk about the color of another person or a bad language to offen the goverment.      people don't have the actittud to stop with this bad songs how contain censorship see somepeople who write this they say the peolpe don't have the actittud to be or say what they want, i think the we need people like that to  just point fingers and say thats the bad guy but enswer this what good have you done to clean the libraies.      censorship is just a small fight about removeding bad contains from the shelves this is just a call make your city a good place to live help the libraries help today change you future tomorrow make a differens
0.8 one @month subject the censorship of library content in certain places and times, whether fictional or not, to his or her own opinion.  i personally disagree with the concept.  the facts point out that society fears the dystopia predicted by publications exploring the outcome of similar campaigns and has instated systems designed to prevent such occurrences.  certain examples stand in play to explicate my opinion.       society, at least in my native @location and surely abroad in other democratic countries, dislikes enforced censorship for a few reasons.  first, many countries have a @caps of @caps and priviledges upheld in the face of the law.  our founding fathers wrote out one of the documents establishing this trend on the prompting of the general public.  the first ten ammendments to our fine constitution, bundled as the @caps of @caps, resulted.       some of the included statements ensure the freedom to speak as it publicly pleases us as citizens and the freedom to write, individually and collectively without boundaries.  the removal of these principles so ingrained in our nation's conscience would cause a general uproar.  we as a people instituted our government to preserve our freedoms, and we could prepare ourselves to replace it as implied in the @caps of @caps if so required of us to continue doing just that.       secondly, publications such as the ones mentioned for banning rebuke the enforcement of opinion for its effects on society.  i can mention three books portraying this dystopic outlook on censorship.  '@caps @num,' required by state standards for one possible choice of reading assigned to us by my teacher, describes book burning and utmost uniformity between citizens.  '@date,' by @person, i know describes a dystopia in which all citizens completely submit their will to and omnipotent '@caps @caps,' who utilizes omnicient surveillanceeven though i have not read the composition myself.  '@caps @caps,' a recent novel by @person whose title employs a pun on the name of @date's prime antagonist, weaves the exciting tale of an older teenager who tries to beat the system of surveillance from under the radar.  all, however, betray a sense of fear in their content, and that fear has transferred directly into local civilization.       in reviewing the aspects of censorship portrayed in its effects, the system itself reveals that the even the intended creation of a utopia and compliance through censorship @month result in decline and misery throughout the area within which government or civil officials practice the method.  in any case, a more effective solution must exist today.  to prove the point, let me introduce some content advisory systems currently in place.       libraries divide themselves into sections for the various age groups, and therefore create an inherent barrier between differing groups of content deemed appropriate only in the face of maturity.  the film and television industries rely on ratings displayed at various times during video to provide the same sort of psychological fence dividing content into pieces.  even the video game industry, into which i plan to inject myself upon exiting college, has a system in place to separate existing media into tiered subcategories designed in a similar way to film ratings.  different regions utilize different systems, but that of  the @organization, or the @organization for the @organization, compares relatively well in ranking video games to the rest of the globe.       as explained, censorship already exists in a form accptable to all.  nobody forces anybody to comply to the recommendations, but hopefully everyone does so on their honor.  capable parents most definely follow the guidelines which have cropped up over the years.  only if these methods of moderation were enforced would everyone be upset.  it's up to everyone to prevent a situation like unto the worst-case scenario and useresponsibly the systems available for this purpose
0.6 libraries are ment for all types of books, movies, music, magazines. it gives you a variety of things to look at or even check out. an offensive book or movie or even music shouldnt be taken off the shelf just because it has a few bad things in it. people @month or @month not agree with this, but everyone is entitled to their own opinion. through my own experiences, observations, and the reading i will help and explain my own opinion in why i dont think offensive books, movies,music, and magazines should not be taken off the shelf.     if a book is offensive it does not deserve to be taken off the shelf. somebody most likley worked hard on that book so it could be put on to the shelf. if you find a book offensive it should be put off into a different section that tells you in head of time what books are in that section. i have not had any real experiences with this but i know people are awear of what are in the books before they're put onto the shelf and would therefore not put anything offensive next to a childrens book. same thing with music and @caps's. music is music and it is there to be listened too. people like all types of music and have their favorite bands so if they dont like certain bands because they swear or whatever doesn't mean that album deserves to be taken off the shelf. @caps's usually have the rating on the front so if it is not appropriate for your age than dont pick it up. if it has nudity or sexual content it will tell you or be put in a different section. for instance at my old library where i used to live in @location, @location they would put all rated @caps movies into a different section and if you were going to check it out you would have to be @num or older or have a parent with you. it is really all up to the person, they could either make the right choice or the wrong choice. it's not the libraries fault if you pick up an offensive book because well, you should have some common sense.          the libraries shouldnt have to take offensive things off the shelfs because some people lack common sense or just dont know what they are doing. they could make more of an effort too kind of seperate bad from good, wrong from right, and even appropriate to non appropriate. but it is usually all up to the person making that decesion.                                                             - @person
0.2 i think censorship could be a good thing where there could be a   room just for grown ups. in the dunkirk library there is a room that has just adult books and the kids cannot go in there with out a parent. so whenever you go in there your parent are with you. but i dont think you can check them out. but if i had a kid i would not want them to see that kind of stuff until they got older so i think there should be seperate rooms. so whenever they got older and maturd they could go in there and see the books and maybe one day check them out and read one of them.      but on the other hand why not leave them on the shelf for kids to see because if not there gonna see iot other places or from other people then they go home asking there mom what this means and stuff why not let them learn on ther own from a book. there are some people that woulf agree with that but then there are people that would disagree with that. so maybe there should be rooms for different books and you can go in them whenever you want or maybe there should be rules that you cant go in there with out a parent.          i don't no what to do maybe there should be a vote between people if they like it or not. but some people would be mad over that so if you chose one someone would not like it or aomething like that.my upion is to just keep the books there and let the kids find out on there own.some people would think im a bad parent but would you want you child to find out somwhere else.
0.4 censorship in libraries differ in certain areas. i personally love reading, and like all kinds of books. and i know that there are some books that i have read that my parents would not aprove of. but has that ever stopped me? not exactly.     i think that after a certain age, people should be aloud to read whatever they want. i mean, if i ever thought i could not be mature enough to read a certain book. then i will not get or read the book, it is that simple.      as far as music, movies, and magazines go that could be a different story. music is for the most part like a book, just using a different one of your senses. and it is listened to, not read. movies should be judged a little more carefully in my eyes, because movies are like show and tell. that could easily go wrong if children, teens, etc take it more than just a movie.      i think all things should not be judged by assumption. everyone has different opinions and likes. so, therefore material should not be removed from shelves, if there are people that like/support what the book, movie, or music has to offer.
0.6 imagine, you go into your favorite library and you go to grab your favorite book or movie and its not there. the librarian says the book was removed from all public libraries because it was found offensive.      would this not get on your nerves? especially if you had read the book yourself and found nothing wrong with it? sure, there are some books that children should not be allowed to see due to offensive material; but why remove them completely? there are plenty of alternet solutions that could please everyone. such as having a section only adults are allowed into, having a seperate public place for adults to get the books, movies, ect; and having signed permission from a parent or guardian saying their child could check out certain items.      the first solution is to have certain offensive material under lock and key from the public. if only the librarian had access to this material a child could not simply walk in and borrow what he, or she deems fit. the librarian would be the only one allowed to judge if the person, child or adult, could see this section of the librairy.     next, there could be a totally separate building for the offensive material. only people over @num would be let in and you would have to an i.d and a librairy card to get in. this would assure that no one uinderage could recieve or take anything that was deemed unfit.      my last solution is to have signed permission for anyone underage. when the child comes to get a librairy card the parent must be present and fill out an application saying what the child can and cannot check out.      i do not believe that books, movies, music, ect; should be removed from shelves. this directly goes against the first ammendment, free speech. if a person can say what someone else can or cannot read, see, or listen to whats to stop them from taking every @caps given right we have? whats to stop them from censoring everything we write and say? would you want to live in a world like that? i would most certainly not! however, i also believe that certain age groups should not be allowed to have access to certain material. i believe these are good altercations to prevent this from happening if only we take the steps to accomplish them
0.4 i think that the books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should not be removed from the shelvs. if a book, magazine, movie, etc, is found offensive then you should just walk away and ignore it. dont go back and keep looking at it because what you find offensive someone else might like.      the world won't change around you so you shoud do the smart thing and ignore it. if somthing is found offensive on censorship in libraries then mabey its not a good idea for you to be where you are in that library. and if somthing does offend you, you should still act appropreatley and deal with the situation the right way.     when i was younger i used to see book's with a cover titled @caps, @caps, @caps, @caps, etc., and would think it was funny, but the adults didnt think so. the books are put there for people to read not just to look at. the books, music, movies, magazines are not there to offend you in any type of way.  if you find somthing offensive then you should just move away from that area, so that you wont worry about having to be offended.      diffrerent people like different things, so they will have many different verieties to choose from in a library. they might have some things that really offend you or they might have some things that you really like. you have to make a wise choice and know that if somthing is goin to offend you stay away from it.     censorship in libraries have every right to put up any and every peice of book, music, movie, magazine, etc., because it in their phacility. they should'nt have to worry about people being offended by anything they put up. they should'nt have to worry about people being offended because @percent of the time the things they put up are not bad at all, 'it @month even be helpful,' but to one person it @month be harmful or offend them.     in @caps, censorship in libraries should be able to post or shelve anything they want. if your offended/not offended they have every right to shelve whatever it is. because in the real world you dont always get what you want, and you wont always like what you see
0.6 a library is safe haven. a place people can go to escape the world and stick their head into a book. it is a place filled with knowledge and information. you can find information on anything in a library, from any point of view. information in libraries should not be censored, even if the information is considered offensive.     a library should not be biased. removing certain information from a library would be biased to whatever group believes in that knowledge. whether or not something is offensive, the information should be out there for one to learn about if he chooses. having information in a library that @month be offensive does not mean a person is oblidged to read it. katherine paterson brings up a good point when she says, 'if i have the right to remove that book from the shelf...and you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. and then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us'. if everyone could remove a book that offended them, there would be no books left.      there are many different views on many different subjects and everyone should have the opportunity to be educated on others' points of views. for example, there are many different religions in the world. many of the religions have very conflicting points of views and some of their view points @month offend each other. that does not mean that we should not provide information on different world religions simply because a person from another religion @month be offended. every person that goes to a library should have the right to educate themselves on others' religions. if we censored all the books that offended people, we would live in a very uneducated world.     a library is a place of education and learning. it is a place one can go and learn about any subject he chooses. if libraries censored information, then it would no longer be a place that is unbiased. it would hold a sway to a certain group of people and therefore, no longer be a safe haven for all to go and escape the world. one could not go to a library and get different points of views on every subject. censorship on books and other materials in libraries would be a very negative thing.
0.4 censorship, @caps or @caps?          i can understand why libraries would decide to keep certain books off their shelves. libraries are a place for learning and work. if you were sitting near someone at a public library who was reading smut you could feel awkward.      although some people @month find certain items unoffensive, other @month disagree. imagine you are a mother with a young child who decided to wonder through the library. your child finds a magazine. it's '@caps'. not something that you are going to want to explain to your child. if the library were to have not kept the magazine, it never would have happened. libraries are a public place that should be taken seriously.    if people really want to find something that is inappropriate they can find it somewhere else. the modern world today makes it easy for people to find just about anything without a large hassle. therefore it should be fine to keep certain materials out of our libraries.      how can people take libraries seriously if there are dirty books, or books with rude language, and scandalous themes. if you are trying to get work done or learn and there are distracting items on the shelves then it @month make things more difficult. libraries are serious places and should be treated as such.
0.4 do you ever feel like books, music, movie, magazines and etc., are offensive sometimes? to my experience of lising to music and watching movies it can be offensive somtimes with out even knowing it. i have lisn to rap before and all the cuss words they use, and watching movies with only white people or black people. so i think some music, moives and etc., could be taking off.     if i think somthing is a offensive i pretty much blow it off like its nothing. i do that beacuse i have watch @caps the @caps the white and black people didnt get a long, and they had to play football to geather. then they finally got along and won the champion game. to me i think thats awesome beacause people were offensive, and got over it and now there friends. so  dont take @caps offensive. i say that beacuse how do you know that the actor or the writer was or is talking about you. i look at this like its a little deal. i like @caps like that i find it entertanment. it can also help you learn, about whats happening to our world, and what we have acomplished. so i really dont take this @caps a offensive. but, other people can take it offensive and thats there problem. there is nothing that can be done its over with. if something is a offensive then dont lisn to it or dont watch or read it. so dont think its right to pull it of the shelf and abhor it. they can have a really good meaning behind it. there are many movies, songs and books in the world that are good. so dont abominate it and go on in life dont let @caps get to you.     thats why i dont think its right to pull it off the shelf and take it offenisive. thats why i think it not bad to take @caps offensive.
0.4 libraries     do you go to libraries? many people all over go to libraries for many different reasons. sometimes when you go there, you have to have a reason to be there. you also have to be very quite. libraries are very interesting in many ways.     some @month ask what a library is, well they are good places to go. people can go there for many different things. most of the time, when people go to a library, they go to get books. not only can you get books from there, but also go there for school tutouring, for a place to read, and just to go somewhere quite. see libraries have many things to do.     why do people go to libraries? well i personally do not go to a library but many others do. people that like to read go there to get a kind of book they want. i would go there for totouring for school, i honestly need it. it helps you alot and gets your homework done. my mother goes there on some occasions, like, to get information from a book or a computer. they have alot of information they you can look for. then there are online geeks, who like to get online for video games. i get on the internet but not for video games. there is another reason why people go to the library.     my little sister loves going to the library. she is only eight years old. why am i telling you this? well when you go into a library, you can not get a book if you are under age. in that case, you have to have parents permission to be able to get one, but not only that, you have to have a library card in order to get a book. i no, stupid rules right? so then again you have to have parents permission for that to! well after the permission is all said and done, when you go to get a book, you have to make sure it's you own grade level. i have to watch that with my sister all the time because if not, then they will yell at you. i personally think that is good for most kids. so now you know that libraries are very strict.          now that i told you all about libraries, i hope you learned something from it. remember that they are very good places to go to for information, to get books, or just to go somewhere quite. you can always find a library around, there are no @caps! well if you don't like to read or be quite, then you shouldn't go. i'm going to leave that to yourself.
0.4 i believe that if some people don't like a certain book or movie then they should be able to tell the library about that itme and it should be removed from the library. the library should allow people who use the library to take away things that are offensive to its customers.     some parents who come into a library with their children let their children go off and look at books by themselves which is what my @caps used to let me do when i was a kid. if children are by themselves with no adult supervision and wander into an adult reading section they could look at something bad. they could also buy a magazine that looks perfectly fine on the outside but have offensive images on the inside.      when i was ten years old, my family and i went on vacation to @location. we were watching a baseball game that was on commercial break one night. we were fliping through the channels wating for the game to come on. we were all watching the television when an offensive image came on the televison that children's eyes shoudn't see. that occurance happened when i nor my parents wanted me to see it. that image was an adult image and was meant for adults only, but childrens eyes can see it as well. libraries should think of this when they are puting books and magazines on their shelves. they might be making a little bit of money but they are effecting a childs life in a negative way. things like this could happen in a library also because children who are young won't always know what is a childs book and what is an adult magazine. children also might ask their parents for music that the case of the music might look fine on the outside, but have cursing and bad things on the inside. this is the reason why all items in a library that are offensive to people should be removed from libraries.     if people who go to the library don't like something on the shelves they should be able to ask the library to take the item off the shelve. the libray might not do it everytime, but taking items off the shelves would make libraries more enjoyable and safe for children. if the library doesn't take the items off the shelve it could effect their business in a negative way. the library should only take off the items that regular visitors to the library ask for. the library shoudn't listen to someone who has visited the library only a few times. the library should listen to its customers that visit the library often.      i think that all offensive images to people that visit the library should be taken off the shelves and removed from the library. the library should listen to its customers not only because it could effect their business, but becasue it could effect the lives of children in a positive or negative way.
0.6 in every school or library many people see books that are inappropriate for their taste. everyone has their own opinion, and what might seem offensive to you, @month be something that someone might want to know about. so should we take the books that only the majority of the people think are offensive off the shelves, or should we keep them anyways? here is what i believe we should do.     books are meant for learning and for pleasure not to try to offend anyone. they each have their own purpose and there was a reason for why they were written. there are tons of books out there that many people dont like, but that doesn't mean someone else doesn't. we should keep the books in the schools and in libraries, because @month be they might help someone in a way and if they weren't there, how would that person get help if nothing else was avalible?      one thing we can do is categorize the books by the genre, so that way people know what they are looking for. many people find these books that are 'offensive' because they come across them randomly. if each book was put into a certain category then that incedent wouldn't happen. it also helps keep everything organized that way. so when you go into the library you know what you are looking for, you can just go right to that section and not look at anything else that @month be offensive to you.     keeping books on shelves is what all libraries and schools intend to do. that is the main reason for libraries. they help you learn and get information about things that maybe you can't get anywhere else. if every library took off the books each person complained about what the point in having the library? there would be nothing left.      in all, everyone is entitled to their opinion and has a right to think that a book is offensive, but the reality is that it was written for a reason. if the library or the person who published it thought it was going to be a big deal, they probably wouldnt have put it out there for the world to see. so keeep the books on the shelves
0.4 my name is @caps and my views on censorship in libraries are that if any material that are found offensive should be take off the shelves. i have never came across a material that was offensive to me, but maybe someone else has and it really offended them. i'm not the type of person who would start an argument but i am a type of person who will speak whats on my mind and tell you what i believe in.      people are concerned about if libraries take off certain kinds of books that their will not be books left on the shelves for anyone else. i have to say there are other places you can buy books at beside the libraries such as stores as in @organization, @organization, and etc. like i said i have never came across a book that i think should be pulled off the shelf, but of course i don't read a whole lot either but the books i have read i have never came a crossed any that were terrible.     books that have like how people can kill themselves, or how people get pregnant, and so on, them can be pulled off the shelves, but if you have a child in the library they shouldnt even be in the adult book section anyways, they should be in the kids book section. i have never heard of a kid book that is terrible and that should be pulled off the shelf. most authors are smarter then that, or at least i would hope so.      music is a whole story its self. in my opinon if you don't want your kids to listen to adult music then don't let them. i know a lot of music that is bad and that i would never let my children listen to it but i know well enough if i don't want them to listen to it them i'm not going to play it while their around. i grew up around rap music so thats all i listen to, but when i have kids i know what they will be able to listen to and what they wont be able to listen to.      movies is the one that i have a problem with the most because in libraries, and other places such as, @organization, and book stores they just put out movies for everyone to see and it doesn't matter what's on the cover or what it's called. now movies with bad covers and bad titles could be pulled off the shelves such as all the '@caps @caps' movies. the name of the movies aren't bad but the movie its self is not for a child to see so why even have it out on shelves for kids to see and want to watch it?      magazines and etc i don't have a big problem with because libraries don't have bad ones, but book stores do such as 'playboy and play girl' but they are usually put back in the very back behind all other magazines so children can't see them only adults can. the only way a child would see them is only if you point them out.      i think i've said all i can say about my opinions and my experiences about books, music, movies, and magazines in libraries that should or shouldn't be pulled off the shelves. i havn't had a lot of experience but maybe that's because i don't have kids yet, i guess i will find out when i do have kids. i happy to explain my experiences and opinions to people who really care and want to know
0.4 i believe that some materials in the libary should be taken off. some people @month find them offensive because they might have bad things in them. some types of music have bad language in them and people dont want little kids finding them. if a little kid saw that stuff then they would learn bad things. and they would say it in front of everybody and then everybody would being saying it.     alot of books are ok to read because they dont have bad things in them. some people like reading books that have drama and some people dont. most books re ok to read. but some can have langauge in them and ahouldnt be aloud in the libary. but they can still be in there because some people might want to read them. if people dont want to read them then they shouldnt get them.     some movies have bad stuff in there. that kind of stuff should not be in there because alot of people dont want to watch movies like that. and if a kid would walk in there and get one and if it had that stuff and the parent fount out then the libary could get sewed for having that stuff. so they should be taken out of the libary so people wont get them. the libary can keep children movies in there to watch because they are not bad.     if i worked at a libary then i would take magazines out. sports magazines would be ok to keep in there. but alot of the others ones should not be there because they have alot of bad things in there and i wouldnt let people take them so i wouldnt have them in there. but sports and stuff would be ok because sports are not bad for people to read. people like reading about sports because it is interesting to read.     that is just what i thank. other people might see it the other way and they can. people are different and they will thank different things. some people might want to read that and some people dont. so it just shows you that people are different because they thank things different then other people do. and some libaries have that stuff and some dont. sp if you are one of those people that like that stuff then go to one of them that have that stuff. and if you are one of those people that dont then go to one that dont have that stuff so you can get what you want and they can get what they want
0.4 do i believe that certain materials should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive? i do not think it should matter weather we have music, movies or magazines in the library. some people like to come in the library to relax and look at a magazine or listen to some music.      i do not think it bothers anybody by what other people are doing there, if it is not bothering them it should not bother anybody else. i see people sometimes reading a book and listening to music. it does not bother me when they do this. it is a way for them to drown out the world and enjoy a good book.     there is only one reason why we should keep certain materials out of the library. it is that some people get very loud when there looking at magazines, or when there music is turned up way to loud. other than that i do not think we should keep those types of materials in the librarys.      i am a reader my self and i like to read in peace. so i like to listen to my music while i am reading. i also like to read magazines every once and awhile. it is real relaxing to me.     those are my reasons on why it should not matter weather we have those types of materials in the library
0.6 no i as an @caps cetazine do not feel that any materials should be removed. there are many reason i feel this way and i hope that after people have read this they will agree with me. there are three main points supporting my opinion and i plan to list them below.      first and for most is the fact that this is @location. @location is suposed to be the land of the free and the home of the brave, or at least thats what the national anthem tells me. so to me if some one removes a book or movie from a library becasue they find it offencive they are trying to take away one of my right as an @caps cetacine. the right they are messing with to me is the right of freedom. i should be free to be able to walk into a library and grab any book i wish. i should be free to go to the movie store and find and rent any movie a choose from the shelf. if they put a movie or book away if they make it to were i can't get to it then they are messing with my freedom, and this is somthing i can't stand as an @caps. i should be free to read or watch what ever i choose to.     which brings me to my next point. this point is a simple and logical one. my second point is that people have the choice to read or watch the movie. just because it is there it does not meen that they have to read or watch it. if someone doesn't like a book good for them don't read it. if someone doesn't like a movie good for them don't watch it. it is rather quit simple in my opinion if someone doesn't like said book or movie then just leave it alone and don't mess with it. they shouldn't have the right to ruin it for everone else. just because one or two or even twenty people find a book offencive doesn't mean they have the right to remove it. there @month five million other people out their who love said book so why ruin for everyone just to make a few people happy. they do have the right to say no and not read or watch the movie, but they don't have the right to say i can't.     finaly people say that said book or movie should be removed because a child might get it and it is not apropreat for children. well to that i have to say it is the parents job to make sure a child is not readind or watching something they shouldn't. if i child gets a hold of a book that is said to be bad it is the parents job to tell them to put it back. people don't have the right to completly remove said book or movie just because a kid might get it.      so there is my opinion on this little matter. i don't feel that libraries should be censored. i feel we all have the right o make own decisions and that we have the right to read or watch what ever we choose. it is not fair to get ride of a book just because a few people don't like it. hundreds of othes might love it, and like i said before if someone doesn't like a certain movie or book then don't read it or watch it. don't ruin it for everyone else though.
0.6 some books are offensive but not all of them. some libraries have begun to censor their book collection by removing ones they thought could be offensive. i believe there should not be any censorship in libraries.     one reason i do not believe that there should be censorship in libraries is that tons of good books are lost because of it. some libraries do not carry @person books because he uses curse words. they should not remove the books completely they should just warn people of the language.     a second reason why i do not believe in censorship is that some books on different religions get removed. i once saw a librarian throw a book away simply because it was about the @caps religion. this was a horrible action because the @caps religion is an extremely interesting one and now many people will never know anything about it.     a third reason is that they @month end up offending some people by removing a book. i once heard of an @caps family complaining about a library because they removed a book about the @caps religion. i found this upsetting because everyone deserves to have access to the books that they want.     i propose that instead of censorship the libraries seperate the books by different subjects and genres then put up signs warning anyone that goes into that section. this way everyone can get the books that they want to get. the libraries also would not have to worry about people being offended.     i believe there should not be any censorship in libraries. some libraries have begun to censor their book selection by removing ones they thought could be offensive.some books are offensive but not all of them.
0.6 throughout time, fellow people have struggled to censor or ban material that they consider offensive. it @month be the way they were brought up, or simply what they beleive. i do not beleive that it should be up to anyone to say what should and should not be censored for anyone but themselves. everyone has one life, and in this one life we create our personal oppinions and beliefs on what is wrong and what is right. we are completely unaware of many people throughout our life cycles, and saying what should be banned from everybody is almost claiming you know the morals, beliefs, and customs of everyone in the world.     if i came to school one day and brought a book that contained material that i think is relevant and not just pure exploitation, then i should be able to read that as long as i don't influence others by their own will. let's say another student sees me reading that same book and he has grown up in a household that taught him that the situations and material in my book are overly offensive, i do not think he should be able to create a ban of this book just because of his own upbringing. there is such a thing as mass agreement, but there is also a thing called mass ignorance, and to say that i know what should and should not be shown to other people is completely ignorant on my part.      i think the only allowance of censorship should be from parent to child. that is the only situation that someone should be allowed authority over someone else, because they have undeniable duties as parents, and they be able to say what is right knowing they are creating a child to think what is wrong and what is right in their mind
0.6 there is many different topics that could be offensive, @caps just depends on the person's own personal judgement. in my opinion i do not believe that materials should be removed because not everyone has the same view or opinons. if someone comes from a different country or evern a different religion, topics like abortion and racism are going to be viewed very differently. i think having a variety of topics will help expand different thoughts and make the readers of the material see things in a different way.      when i am older and if one of my elementary children was to bring home a book over abortion, i would be concerned. honestly though, i do not believe schools would let inapropriate topics for younger childeren read books like that. @caps is a little bit different with a @caps @caps student though. their maturity level is going to be mature enough to handle the material and i do not think @caps is right for schools to remove something that could actually help someone.      in the book, 'a @caps @caps @caps', there is a lot of detailed events that happen. some might say @caps is too graphic for children but the reality of @caps is, events like those happen in today's society. @caps really opened up my eyes and i am extremely happy i read @caps. the realization actually made me want to help those children who grow up in homes like the one described in the book. i believe @caps had the same effect on other people too and some children might even grow up to help others in that horrible situation.      libraries should be able to have a variety of different books. i am not saying however that they should have books on murder and saying @caps is alright but books that will help expand the children's minds. @caps could even change their lives. some books are a sensitvie topic but who has the right to tell someone something they should believe? @caps would mean more to someone if they found their own way and beliefs then having people tell them what they should and should not do or believe in.      i have also read a book recently titled, '@caps', @caps is about the government granting the ability to @caps your children and then the body parts will go to those in need. @caps is sort of cruel in one way but the topic the author is trying to get across is not. a quote from the book is, 'on one side you have people killing abortion doctors for the right of life and on the other you have people getting pregnant just to sell their fetal tissue'. @caps states that everywhere you go people are going to disagree and agree on things but not everyone will believe in the same thing. @caps shows that just because one person thinks one way is right does not mean another will. the book changed my perspective on many different topics and helped me open my eyes on different views.      racism, abortion, @caps abuse, unwinding your children, what ever the case @month be, some people will support @caps and some will not. i think @caps is time for children around the world to discover for themselves what they truely believe in and taking 'offensive' material from @caps libraries is not going to help any. my opinion on this topic is strongly advising to leave the material alone because for there to be a book about @caps, the author had to have had a reason to write @caps and honestly, what is better for the future then a generation of children grounded to their own true beliefs
0.4 i believe that if you let people take stuff off of the shelves that they didn't like then there would be nothing left. i thank this because there are a lot of parents that don't want their little kids to be seeing it or hearing it. that is because they could get infulenced to do the wrong thang and get themselves in truble for it. then you have some parents that don't care what their kids are doing as long as they are leving them alone. then you have some other that are very over procted.      yes, i think that there are something that should be taken off shelves because they are very interpreit. they are because they are talking a drugs and alchole and trying to get young kids to try it and get addicated to it. that why they can get more money from it and those kids end up geting heard or died from it. all some of thies bussinesses are trying to do is get money from the young because they make to bottles or cantaners look cool. most of the time you will have kids go for it but there are some kids that don't because they don't want to get in truble or heart themsleves.           there are some songs that should not be alowed to be played because of some of the stuff that they say. there are some people and some parents that listen to it and with there kids in the car then their kid will go to school and be sing it and get in truble for it. i think that their are a lot of thang that should be different but they are not because the bussinesses are just happy that they are geting money. they don't care how is buying it as long as they get there money for it and that is not the wright way to look at it you should care about the lives of people and their familys.            then you have some magazines that have some uniperate pitchers in them. they do because they are trying to get guys to buy them just for that one pitcher that is in it. they want it because its a very pritty girl with just a bathing suite on or maybe nothing on. that is why they put it in there so they can get their money off of it. most of the girls that are in them are modles and they are very pritty, but sometime there will be a little boy that takes his dad and then he takes it to school and get in truble for it. then his partens are enbeist because they didn't know that he had.           that is why i thank that some stuff should be not on the shelves in stores. you will have partens that get it tten leave it laying out and their kids will get in then might take it to school. you should never leave anything that you don't want your kids to have laying out for them to get. that is why i believe that and what i thank about it
0.6 a curious child goes into the library for the first time to find a story to read. yet, when she goes to the children's section, the book she wants is not allowed in this library becuase it is said to promote certain ideals to children. the child goes to her older sister for help to find a different book. the older sister is to busy looking for her own book. she had walked into the library looking to find answers to her questions over a liberal topic. she can't find the book she wants, the library has censored it.      why would we censor librairies if we have the freedom of the press and the freedom of speech? it is not right to censor libraries becuase that is restricitng what is allowed to be read, which is taking away part of our freedom. the press is allowed to print anything, and we the people read it. will that be the next thing that is censored? a book is just like the newspaper, it is relaying a story to entertain the auidence that is reading it.      by censoring libraires that is taking away the freedom of speech. writing is a way to express yourself. authors share there expressions through writing, hoping they can touch someone else's life and be of some assistance. whether the book helps its reader to escape a horrendus day or to answer the questions of a curious teenager. i use books daily to escape the stresses of life, the '@caps @caps' series gave me something to do and allowed me to use my imagination and mind, i could escape into another world and leave my chores behind me.      some @month say that offensive things should be censored. in our culture the slightest thing can called 'offensive' now. if we never learn about these 'offensive' things how would we understand history? there will always be rude things that have been said, but we should be exposed to them so we can learn from it. by censoring these items we will never learn and  neither will our children about other cultures, history, or liberal ideas.      instead of censoring items, there is another solution. make certain items restricted and red flagged. if certain items become restricted; it would mean that people over a certain age are allowed to read them. by doing this a child's mind would not be polluted, but we could still be exposed to different ideas and learn from them. if there was a system to red flag an item, this would allow the reader to know that this item contains what could be considered offensive material so they do not have to expose their selves to it if they did not want to, but others could. this would work becuase the books could stay in the library and still be used but there would be a warning system for those who do not want to be around it or allow their children to be around it.      in conclusion censoring libraries is a bad idea. it takes away our freedom of the press and speech.we are also making ourselves ignorant this way. if we put out a warning system it is fair to everyone. the 'offensive' matterial can stay in the libaries but people will know ahead of time what they are being exposed to and what their children are to
0.8 read with @caps     i do not believe that libraries carry the responsibilty to censor reading materials. when a person enters a library, they immediately must infer that, because libraries are place in which knowledge is accumulated, that some of that information they find @month not cooincide with what they believe. if a person believes a book is offensive, they can just as easily put it down as they had picked it up.     obviously, however, there are certain exceptions. childrens' sections, of course, should be limited to those intended for younger readers. putting '@caps and @caps' into a childrens' section hardly seems logical. just as much as putting '@caps @caps' into the adults section.     in addition, author @person once stated that if she was able to ban a book from a library, the same right would have to be given to all other patrons as well. thus leading to all the books in a library being unable to be read. the knowledge contained within them unknown.     there are, as with any ordinance, exceptions. for example, if a library is intended solely for the use of younger audiences, censorship should hardly be considered a crime. the exclusion of inappropriate items, such as permisquous reading material, keeps childeren from formulating ideas about concepts they @month not be able to fully understand.     with all these things considered, banning books from a library hardly seems to be the best course of action. a library should be a place of enlightenment. opposing ideas should be presented. leaving the readers to formulate their own decisions about what they believe. because books are like atoms. when two opposing types collide, a burst of energy is released.
0.8 in our society today there is an enormous amount of exposure to materials that many adults didn't have when they were a child. young children today see drugs, alcohol, sex, and teen pregnancy portrayed as things a normal child's everyday life consists of. certain television shows, books, and even some popular songs condone these behaviors that many @caps are opposed to. while libraries @month seem to be the most unusual place to have access to these materials, many young children can checkout books that are simply not appropriate for their age. censorship of materials, such as books, movies, and music, that are found offensive or inappropriate are a way to teach young children that life isn't all about what the media portrayes it to be.     one very important reason to allow censorship of materials in libraries is that you might not know what type of book you're looking at. many children, and adults too, walk into the library and look among the books until they see a cover or a title that grabs their attention. while most of the books in a library are age appropriate a child can still grab a book that isn't something they should be reading. there are mass amounts of influential materials from the media and also from peers that a child is subject to. censorship in a library will make it a safer place for children to go and pick up any book in the proper section for them and will also allow the @caps to not have to worry about what their child has selected. as author katherine paterson so rightly said, 'all of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children have taken off the shelf.' @caps should never have to worry about what their child can get ahold of in a public library.     a second reason to allow censorship in libraries is that video stores already have censorship in their shops, along with ratings on all their movies and video games. most video stores have a seperate section of movies that are deemed to have 'adult content' in them. a minor cannot walk into a movie store and go to the section of movies deemed for adults, or someone over the age of eighteen. a minor can't rent an @caps-rated movie without proving that they are seventeen, or they have an adult to rent it for them. the same thing occurs with video games, for example a video game with a rating of @caps, or mature, cannot be rented or bought by anyone under the age of eighteen. @caps censorship should be applied to libraries. having seperate sections based on adult content allow movies and books to be set in a seperate location so that no child can possibly rent something that they have no intention of watching or reading. @caps type of censorship also allows for a parent to choose if their child can see it. an example of @caps would be for a sixteen year old boy. while he cannot go and rent the @caps-rated movie, if his @caps deem it acceptable for him to see, then they can rent it for him. @caps gives the parent control of what their child sees, instead of the child having full control. @caps same type of censorship that video stores have is a perfect way to place censorship in a library.     perhaps the most important reason for censorship in libraries is the early exposure the materials give to the children. many young children have been watching television shows or hearing things on the news that make it seem acceptable in our society to drink at parties when you're not of age, do illegal drugs for the feeling, and have sex at an extremely young age because it's what 'everyone's doing.' @caps is a very risky path to let the young children in our society take. allowing our culture to become @caps way can lead to various sorts of problems, as we have seen all to well. many young kids, some as young as fourteen or fifteen years old, go to parties and drink. when it comes to getting a ride home they go with their seventeen-year-old friend who has a license, and who has also been drinking at the party. now hopefully the story ends that all of the children make it home safely, but that is not how it works in many cases. there have been so many drunk driving crashes recently in our nation with children who should not have even been drinking. @caps ties back to censorship because of the way these kids were pressured into drinking. many adults in the society blame it on peer pressure; but where do the peers get the idea that @caps is acceptable? these ideas come from the influences that the society's children are susceptable to. censorship in libraries is one way of restricting the ideas children are exposed to, and hopefully allowing them lead safer and healtheir lives. while there are so many other factors in the exposure to children of these materials, stopping the exposure in libraries is one way of eradicating early exposure. young children in today's society and culture are exposed to excessive amounts of inappropriate materials.     these three factors, the inability to know what you might be checking out at the library, the fact that video stores already have censorship, and the unecessary exposure to young children, all lead to the need for censorship in libraries. today's society is all about the freedom to allow anything to happen than is acceptable. while some @month see these books or movies as their own freedom to speech the truth is that it is harming the society, hence the need for censorship in libraries and other places where children have access to movies, books, magazines, music, and video games. removing the offensive books, magazines, and movies from shelves in libraries around the country will lead to a safer culture for children to grow up in, and a society where things such as drugs, alcohol, and sex aren't condoned near as often
0.4 i do not believe that these types of books should be taken off of the shelves. everybody has their likes and dislikes with music, books, movies, magazines, etc. if the reader does not like the book, then the reader will not continue reading the book. if the listener does not enjoy rap music, then they will stop listening and try to find a different kind of music. this topic is about personal opinion and choice. if it was me, then i would say yes to allowing censored materials. i like getting the full effect out of things. i wanna hear the rawness of a song or the anger of a character in a book. i don't want to read and see a bunch of little stars on a censored word. i want to see that word and feel its full effect.          i am actually reading the very controversial book '@caps of @organization'. as you @month know the author of this book is named @person. another thing you @month know is the use of the '@caps-word'. this is a very controversial book because he doesn't call colored people black or colored, he calls them the '@caps-word' throughout most of the book. most people now think this is very racist. but back in @location's time it was very commonly said and used in his society. it wasn't racist back in that time, i mean it still was but it wasn't as controversial as it is today. now critics and some readers don't agree with this term and think the book should not be held in libraries or read at all for that fact. i have to disagree though. i understand why he used the word, it was a common word in his time. if you take that word away from the book, you lose some history of the old south.     people have the freedom of speech to say whatever they want to say, whether that be in written form or verbally said. i honestly say some of these censored words. most of the time these words are said when i am angry at myself or another person. people can't control what we say, so why should they be able to control what we write or sing? just a thought. saying that, on the other hand i can see why people don't want these censored words. maybe they just don't want their little kid to say a censored word in class to the teacher or to another classmate. that's understandable, but you can't protect your kids from censored words. they are everywhere. from video games, to movies, and even most books now. you cannot control what other people do or say. it is their freedom to do whatever they want.
0.6 every individual has their own opinion on censorship. some people believe that, in some instances, it is perfectly fine, but others disagree. i'm one person that thinks that, in some instances, things should be censored.       schools have the right to censor what is put in their libraries for their students to read, especially magazines. some of the magazines out there have articles in them that arent appropriate for school hours or even in the school building. schools @month not want something inapropriate on their shelves where students can see it. censorship is even more understandable in elementary schools. younger students' libraries should be monitored even more carefully. younger kids, such as elementary age, don't really know what they should and shouldn't read.     in public libraries, things are a little different. parents can usually monitor what their kids check out. most adults know to read the summary on the back of the book to know what is being checked out. if the summary is too vague, then they know to read a few pages inside the book.     a couple of times, i've gone to the public library and i checked out a book that i thought was a suspense. when i got home and began reading it, it turned out i was wrong. the book was a romance book that i didn't care to read. so, i returned the book to the library. most of the time you can read the synopsis on the back of the book, but that doesn't always reveal too much about the book. so, the best thing you can do is read a couple of pages out of the book before you check it out.    everyone has a right to their own opinion on censorship. i believe that in some instances things available to be checked out should be censored. in other instances, things should be left up to the adults and the parents to decided what they want to be allowed  to checked out.
0.6 the last thing i would want my children seeing in a @caps is offensive material. a @caps is thought of as a learning zone. somewhere for people to learn about new things and expand their knowldge. if there are dirty magazines, movies on sexuality, offensive music or inappropriate websites available to children it completely defeats the purpose of having a safe learning enviornment.      my opinion is that libraries should be used primarily for educational purposes. that means that there should be appropriate books and magazines that are also age appropriate. computers are also a great resource but can contain many offensive material. my standpoint on this issue is that the computers in the @caps should be monitored. if someone wants to look up inappropraite images and websites, then they should do it on their own time, in the privacy of their own home. it should not be allowed in public where innocent children will be exposed to it. that isn't fair to the kids, and it isn't fair to the parents who have tried to protect them from that kind of suggestive material.     i'm sure that there are many people out there that would disagree with my proposal. however those @month be the type of people who aren't morally structured as i, or those who don't have kids to look out for. or perhaps they just aren't as concerned about the issue. they will argue that there is really no severe need for the computers to be monitored, or that they have blocked websites. yes, they @month think that there is no real harm. but that @month just be because that is the way they were raised, causing them to think in that same respect. with the magazines, some @month argue that children will be exposed to suggestive material sometime, so why not now? but if everyone were to start thinking like this all morals would be forgotten.      in some cases morality might not be the issue at all. in fact, religion might be the most important issue. a lot of people are religious and their particular religion @month be against looking at suggestive and 'unholy' material. parents will not want to walk into a @caps with their children and find them starting at images that go against what they believe in. they will think of it as losing their child's innocense. having these things out in the open and accessable to kids and teenagers could unintentionally send a message to them that indulging in sexual activities is acceptable when according to their religion it is not.     when i was a little girl i remember going to the @caps often with my mother to pick out books for school. i distinctly remember seeing naughty magazines laying across a table as i was walking toward the children's section. my mother was appauled that they had those laying out in the open like that, and especially right next to where the children's books were. she complained to one of the librarians and asked that they please remove them. the librarian apologized and agreed that the placement of the magazines was a little out of line. ever since then my mom has been a little sceptical and dreads going to that @caps. i suppose that is why i am so involved in this issue and the reason for this informative article.     i did not write this to place blame on anyone or to judge people for their beliefs. on the contrary, the purpose for my writing this was to inform general public of these issues and to explain my side of the arguement. i don't see the reason of having these materials on hand at a @caps where almost anyone has access to them. i do not understand the need for them to be obtainable at a @caps, or if there is a need at all. i'm hoping that by reading this i have opened the eyes of some concerned parents out there, or have at least made them aware of the matter. thank you for your time.          sincerely, @person
0.4 i do not belive that they should be takein off the shelfs beacuse @caps people still come to get that sort of stuff. @caps people say is not plite for little kids 'well keek your kids away from it then.'             @caps people dont like it and @caps people do. i am one of the people that like that kind of stuff, beacuse no one can tell us what we can and cant watch or say. it is our life if we wanna watch that kind of stuff or read about it we can.            noone is telling people that they half to read it or even look at it. if you dont like it dont look at it. @caps kind of stuff should be off to the side where you know what your goin to look at and away from kids                       @caps shouldnt even be a problem. @caps is just people that think they are high class and think if you look at that or watch that or read that you are a dirt bag. that is there opinon.             in conclusion  i think if you dont read @caps stuff or watch @caps stuff you are trying to be something you are not. trying to act better than every cause your to high class to read something like that.  we all get a laugh out of @caps kind of stuff.
0.6 in my opinion, books that @month seem offensive to someone should be kept on the shelf. meaning that people should be allowed to check them out in the library and read them even if some people think those books in particular are offensive, or @month come off as offensive.      a person should be able to read an article without feeling like somone wrote that book, article, or magazine to be offensive. yes, but at the same time it is up to you, the reader, to pick a book that does and will not make you feel uncomfortable. do not pick a book to read that discriminates against football players if you are a football player, because most likely it is going to upset you, or make you uncomfortable. well say you want to read a book that discriminates against football players, and it does make you feel uncomfortable, do not take the book, and go complain to someone about how the book, or article makes you feel if you picked it out to begin with. if it makes you uncomfortable, put the book, or article down. no one is forcing you to read it or look at it.      people should be allowed to read whatever type of books they would like, and about anything that interests them. just because an article, or book is offensive to you, does not mean it is offensive to other people. if we were to take all the books, articles, magazines off the shelfs of library's there would not be any books left for us to read because every book written offends at least one person.      movies are a whole other issue in itself. there are many types of movies, and within those types of movies are types of things people do in the movies to make it funny, scary, shocking, stupid, etc. if you do not cuss and say you go watch '@caps @caps' you are going to find it offensive because every other word they say is a cuss word. if you do not like @caps people jump out of strange places and scare the crap out of you, then you are not going to watch '@caps.' @caps people find movies offensive or not to their liking the usually go and try to make a big deal out of it, and sue the people who made the movie. you doing that is causing more trouble than it is actually worth. the same thing with movies as books, if we were to take all the movies out of movie stores, and just stores in general that were offensive to at least one person in any way, we would not have any movies left to watch because at the end of the day; there are tons of movies that would offend some people, and make them uncomfortable.      in conclusion, if you find a movie, song, book, article, or magazine that is offensive to you, get over it. keep that book or whatever it is out of your reach and in other peoples, because at the end of the day no one is going to help you sue an author, producer, or music production company because something they wrote, directed, or sung offends you. in my opinion you should just read what interests you, watch what you like, and listen to the songs you usually listen to
0.2 dear, katherine paterson      i was was thinking about if they items you listed to be taken offenisve, well i believe that its a free country and that all people should be treated equal,what im trying to get to is that the newpaper organization should keep doing what they do! in fact should add more. yes their should be restictions on some things but to solve the under age buying just make people use their @caps!         by doing this i think this would solve alot of issues, taken it all away would be alittle to serious for just some magazines or moives.so keep doing what your doing just set a higher restiction on sells and things should be just fine !                              from your dearly,                                             zack
0.6 books in libraries are available to everyone, so who's job is it to decide which ones are appropriate and which are not? this is a very controversial topic. on one side, parents are worried about what their children have access to at local libraries. they believe libraries shouldn't contain any books that might be found offensive. on the other hand, whose job is it to decide what is offensive and what is not? if people are given the right to remove books that they think are not appropriate, eventually libraries will have so few books that it would be worthless to even get a library card.     i believe that it is the job of parents and other adults to teach a child morals and what is right and wrong. if kids have developed morals and values, parents wouldn't have to worry so much about what they're checking out of the local library. kids are faced with issues of right and wrong everyday, and parents should learn to trust that their child is making the right decision.     as a teenager, i know that people have access to far worse things on the internet than in libraries. if people begin to censor libraries, surely they will begin to censor the internet, and the idea of freedom of speech will be thrown out the window. people have a right to be heard and share their opinions, and who has the right to say that a person's opinion doesn't matter? in my opinion, the act of removing books from a library says just that.      just a few months ago i had to write a research paper about the @person, and in order to find information about the topic, i had to check out books from the library. some of the information i read about the topic was horrible and very offensive, but i couldn't have written my paper without it. books in libraries have information that is vital, whether the books are offensive or not. books can be used to teach people lessons on what is right or wrong. by being educated about even the most offensive things, people can learn from them and form their beliefs. removing offensive books from libraries will not lessen the chance that someone's child will run across the information that they contain. there are many sources for information, offensive or not, and a library is just one of them.      people are responsible for their decisions, and it is each individual's choice on what they choose to read, watch, or listen to. we are faced with choices everyday. should we watch a movie even though we know it's inappropriate? should we listen to a song even though it gives off a bad message? checking out a book from the library requires the same decision. each person must choose what is right, and it is not our job to tell others what they can and can't do.
0.4 libraries have no right in my mind to decide what is offensive and what isn't. libraries shouldn't have the view on censorship the people who rent or buy the items should. the @caps has an idea of what is offensive but they shouldn't be able to make that decision. if the @caps wants buisness they should try to make sure the customers are happy. libraries should take surveys of what everyone wants.     not all the people in the world have the same idea of what is a offensive book, magazine, movies, music, etc. the different views of people can vary from a lot to none at all. if the people feel that they are that offensive then they should bring it up with the @caps and find a solution instead of getting rid of these items. a safe but easy solution would be to create a section just for offensive items the @caps or people claim them to be.    another possible solution would be to jus rearrange the area's of the books into to main category's such as offensive and none offensive, and then break it down into their specific categorys. so the libraries need to have a survey showing what items the people think are bad and the librarys opinions and then go on from there. the surveys could be made up of a paper one you fill out in the @caps to it's online website. the survey would have a list of books, movies, magazines, and music that people could check off.     now the @caps needs money to keep books and other items in stock and so they can repair them if necessary. so if the @caps feels that a book is offensive they shouldn't have the right to censorship. all these books have been in libraries for this amount of time why change it now. think about it if it was offensive why did they put it into the @caps in the first place.     so in conclusion the @caps should have know right to censorship books, movies, magazines, music, or any other item they have. this would cost time and money which they don't have. customers could possibly stop comming in because of the change which would be a loss of money. now everyone knows a big loss of money could hurt any buisness and possibley bankrupt them, or could take weeks, months, or even years to recover and no buisness wants that. so the easy way to make sure that doesn't happen jus leave everything the way it is
0.6 should materials that some people find offensive be removed from libraries? no i do not think that any materials should be removed from libraries. a librarie should have lots of different kinds of books, magazines, music, and movies.     one reason i think that a librarie should have all sorts of different books is because everybody doesn't like to read the same thing. like for example some kids could love to read scary and gory books and others could like to read books about sports or love stories. so maybe the kids that read sport books could be offended by all the gory books, but that wouldn't be fair to take them out of the librarie because some kids like to read gory books.     another reason they shouldn't remove any magazines, books, etc, is because it is nice to get to read or look at different things. people would get bored if their librarie only had books about war. kids need to learn how to read different kinds of stories. also if your librarie has all different kinds of magazines kids could learn a lot of interesting facts. you can find a lot of amazing things in a magazine. so if you only had four magazines about the same thing kids wouldn't discover anymore cool facts.     a librarie is a place where kids like to go and enjoy some peace and quiet and look and read different things. so i think if you started taking specific things out of the librarie then i think kids would stop coming to the librarie. a librarie contains awsome infromation that kids could learn, but if you start taking things out then not that many kids will come to the librarie because they will not be learning @caps new.     so if i had any say in this i would keep all things in the librarie. i would not remove @caps! you want people to come to your librarie so you dont want to do @caps that can jeperdize people coming to your librarie. i think if you start removing things then your going to have less and less people come in and eventually maybe your librarie will get shut down because you have no buisness. so leave everything on the shelves.
0.4 i think that movies, and magazines should be censured to kids at the library. there are many reasons these things should be censured and in this paper i am going to explain why they should be censured. i am also going to give a few examples of some stuff that shouldn't be possible for kids to get.      the main reason movies should be censured is because movies that are rated @caps are not only supposed to be rented by children but it wrong to rent these movies to them. i mean if there is a sex scene or something and your only like eight years old this would be awkward for the parents to explain what the actors are doing. i mean if you were a parent would you want to explain to your eight year what sex is.      the next thing that i think should be censured at the library is magazines. i know three in perticular off the top of my head, and they are @caps, @caps, and @organization. these three magazines talk about how to be better in bed. i really don't any kid, teenagers included should need to know how to be better in bed. they also have several unhealthy diets that teenagers might try. this could cause them to get very sick and if they're already skinny, they could possibly die.      well this pretty much sums up what i think about library contents being censured. i don't really think there are many books that are that bad for kids ears and eyes. i mean there are romances but i don't think any kid is going to last thru a whole romance, because they are pretty boring. well i hope this will prevent libraries from letting kids get ahold of this kind of content
0.4 censorship in libraries has been a major concern in school systems for many years. in many school libraries certain books, music, movies, and magazines have been removed because of the content in them. these items can be removed for these common types of content wich include, use of violence, sexual acts, drug use, and inapropriate language. many parents of young kids are always wondering what their kids are doing at school. most parents would not want to find out that their kids are being introduced to such things at a young age, because it could influence them to participate in these activities.     in my opinion i do believe that certain material in school libraries should be removed but not in public libraries because a public library can be divided into sections depending on age groups. inn elementry and middle school libraries, items should be censored because young students do not need to be introduced to things that are inapropriate or violent in anyway. in a school environment kids should only be introduced to drug use, and sexual activity through some sort of health class because there is where they will learn the true facts and it would be more educational for them, rather than hearing about drugs, sex, and violence in a song or seeing some form of it in a movie.     many kids watch movies that have very violent, and inapropriate scenes, and some of the songs in the world today are exstreamly inapropriate for young kids. their are also many books and magazines that should not be read by young students at school because of the content in them, this is why i do believe that censorship in libraries is a great thing.
0.4 i agree with katherine's statement, but to a certain extent. if a book or magazine has cursing or anything offensive in it, then a student should take it to the librarian and let him/her know they are offended by it. especially if it's in a middle school or elementary school.      of course there's going to be a book or movie or magazine that has something inappropriate in it. one day my friend and i were in the library looking for a book to read, and that's when i first discovered the @caps series. but as i got into the books, the more mature they got. in the last book, @organization, it has a lot of profanity in it. but that doesn't mean i'm not mature enough to not know what it means. same with any other high school student. but you can't protect your children from everything. not even curse words.     so if you see a book at a local library that is absolutely filled with offensive things, and you decide you want it removed, just take it to your librarian and comfront him/her. i'm sure they'll understand. or maybe they won't, and they'll wait to see if anyone else will want it removed. my point is, you can't always protect your children from violent words or movies, or magazines. but you can always stand your ground and try
0.4 libraries have books that are short, long, and everything in between. their are good and bad books, but that all depends on the opinion of the reader. there is no reason that if someone is offended by a book in a library that it should be removed from the shelf. the books on a shelf in the library are there for everyone to read so if one is removed then someone else is missing the chance to have the experience of reading that very book.     would you have some food destroyed if it didn't taste any good to you? no, you wouldn't get it again. so why'd someone have the right to remove a book because they were offended it isn't right your views on something are only an opinion nothing more. your views are not the same as @person's who lives down the street so by removing a book it is pushing your views on somone else.     in conclusion, the books in question could be good or bad in the eyes of the next person to read it. pushy people aren't normally liked by others. books are meant to be read and interpreted by the reader. that is why no one person has the right to take it off the shelf.
0.2 the books, magazines, music, and movies shouldn't be removed from the shelves.  they still have good information that someone other than you @month want to know.  if you take them off of the shelves the people that want to use them don't have the opportunity.   if you remove books then if someone needs one for a reseach paper that they have to do they will not have the nessisary resouces to do the paper, and at the same time the person with the paper @month feel that the non-educational books need to come off the shelves and then that person wont have the books that they want.     if they want the book taken off of the shelf, because of inopropriate language or nudity then the libraries can make a spot that you have to be a certain age to access them. i wasw at the library and there was a woman getting upset, because her son had a movie and book that she didn't think was good for him to have.  the, book and the movie, that he had were in a different area so that minors weren't suposed to get them.  so the woman would be the one that would probibly want to take them off of the shelves, but it wasn't the libraries fualt that he wasn't where he was supposed to be.      the products should stay on the shelves, because someone needs it for something or it wouldn't have been there in the first place.  if they take the products down that certain people don't like then the people that do like it will not have it.  if there are resons that people must have the product off of a shelf then the product should go somewhere else that can be accessed by the people that do want to you the products.  the products should stay on the shelves  so that the people who need, or just want to use the products can use the products.
0.6 many different people have views on what they want their children to be exposed to, whether it be in books, movies, music, or any other type of media. so should libraries be more strict and remove certain items that might come across as offensive or vulgar to parents or even students? i believe that it completely depends on how a library advertises or who they allow to check out what.     i know that a certain case, specific to me, is that my mother did not like me reading a specific series becasue she thought that it was not an appropriate reading material for me. because of that, that does not mean she marched down to the library and demand that they get rid of all the books written by that author. she respected the fact that others enjoyed reading the books and just asked me to steer clear of them and to find something more appropriate for me to read.     in many libraries, i know that they have certain areas for specific age groups of people like children, teenagers, and adults. within those specific designated areas, they have kind of 'sub-area' where they seperate educational from entertainment and so on. let's say one parent gets offended by a specific section, such as a sex education section, should they ask the library to remove it completely? i do not think that will help anything because there are students who use that topic for areas they are studying and parents who use it as educational tools with their own children.     i do believe that libraries should put stamps or notices on their different types of media saying that only a certain age group is aloud to look at them and be able to check them out. an eight year old should not be able to go in and get a @num movie whenever they want to. there should be restrictions on areas like that, but for someone to come in and say to take out all the @num movies is a ridiculous thing to do because there are others who enjoy that type of entertainment.    libraries to respect the fact that there are different types of people with different interests and they try to make their environment as comfortable for everyone as possible. they will have children's videos seperate from the adult videos and they even have a whole seperate section of books for them to discover and journey into. the only thing that i believe should not be in libraries is vulgar magazines or videos. a library is still a public, family area, after all, and no child should accidentily stumble upon any raunchy article.     so, should libraries completely remove areas of media? i do not think so. i think that they should distinguish from adult's and children's materials. katherine paterson says, 'but if i have the right to remove books from the shelf . . . then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. and then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' if we continue to take books off of the shelves then eventually there will be nothing to read.
0.4 books, music, movies, and magazines are all things people use for entertainment and study, something that everyone should have access too.      if someone is offended by one of these things i do not think that they should be removed off shelves or advertisements. many people will still find these books or other recources interesting. if the source is something more adult then it should be placed in a section that is labeled or supported by information that says so.          radio stations play songs that talk about sex, drugs and violence but i believe that kids need to be associated with these things. parents can't keep their children from it all of there life, and most of the bad things said are cut out.     everyone has a different interest in the things that he or she likes. so why should you pull something off the shelf in stores or libraries just because its offensive to one person
0.6 i do not think libraries should have to censor the kinds of books, magazines, etc..., because people should have the right to read anything that want.      people do not necessairly like reading some things, but if it is important that they research something, or read a book for school then they need to have the resources availablet to them. take the book, @caps in the @caps, for example. in that book it describes kidnapping, and the rape of young girls. certain classes would require you to read this book, even though noone would really want to read about that.      some people have different tastes in movies. personally, i prefer horror movies (but not gory) because they get me thinking about whats going to happen next. some people like the really graphic and gory movies, and maybe if the libraries started taking movies like this off the shelf, it would be harder for those people to find them.              certain people would find some things more offensive than other people. who can say where it should stop? movies that make fun or talk about religion would be offensive to the people in that religion, but people from other religions would be un-effected by it. just imagine watching @caps and seeing someone talk about everything you believe in and joking around about it. it would really offend people, while othre people couldn't care less.      basically, i think we have the right to read or watch whatever makes us happy, and if there is something out there that you do not want to see, you just have to ignore it and leave it alone. it should not be ruined for other people who would like to see it
0.6 yes, i believe that certian materials should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. some people do not want to read about those things that they have less intrest in. materials like that can offend many people, so they should be removed from public shelves.      for example, someone, by accident, @month stumble upon a book containing inappropriate materials. they could take it home and begin reading it, and realize that the material that they are reading contains information that offends them. that really concerns some people and can hurt the library that held the book, and they could begin losing customers.      another reason why inappropriate materials should not be publicly displayed is, children. what if a young child was wondering around a store or a library, and randomly picked up a book or magazine with offensive pictures in it? that young child would see things that were not meant for that child to see. but, it does happen. imagine how angry the parents of the child would be. they would most likely do everthing they could to get those materials removed from being displayed in public and from being within a child's reach. children deffinately do not need to be seeing those things and also, even some adults do not even prefer it.      religion is also an example of why places should watch what they put on their shelves. it @month be against some religions to read inappropriate materials. and with out them knowing their book contained it and they read it, they would be greatly offended and very upset. that could turn many people away from reading certain books, or even going to the store where they even purchased those materials.      in conclusion, all of these are perfect examples of why inappropriate materials should be removed to prevent people from being offended. this is why materials such as books, magazines, etc. should be removed from public shelves, because they can offend many people
0.4 i believe if i worked at a library , if i found multiple idems that  has profanity, rasicm, slang.i agree with taking magazines, @caps, music books, @caps books ,etc., i wouldnt want my own children going to the library and finding books with racism, etc.i would like to inspire more people to check out library books but you could'nt if there were inappropriate books .     if i worked at a library and i had to scan all the books to make sure the books were okay for young adults, young children to check out. how would it make you feel if i didnt do a book scan to check the books and one of your children brought home a inappropriate book how would you respond to it?    i would do a observation on all the books that we had in our library. i also think that all libraries should have more inspireing books and cartooon , and baby books for little children. i think if majority of us all went to the library and we found a bad book i think we should have the right to remove it from the shelf, not only i would'nt want my children to see i woul'nt want someone elses children to see. this is how i feel if my child picked up a bad vulnerable book.i would'nt let he/or she go back to the library until they organized there library.     lastly i think librarys should have a big room full of little kids books. also i think they should have different age groups like one room for baby books another room for @num to @num year olds and on up. i hope this inspires you .always read the back of a book before checking it out of the library because you never know what the books going to be about
0.8 censorship in libraries has been an issue among communities for as long as literature has been around. as expressed by katherine paterson, if one has the right to remove a book from the shelf that he or she deems unexceptable, then everyone has the right to remove books that he or she deem unexceptable. everyone has an individual view of what is unexceptable, so that @month leave no book to be left on the shelf. in saying this, if the government censors materials such as books, music, movies, and magazines, there is nothing to keep them from banning all that is there. there is bound to be someone that wants a certain thing to be censored, but the government @month not see it a something to be censored. this brings up another question, what deems something unexceptable to be viewed? in my mind, this is a matter of opinion, so should we leave something like this in the government's hands to decide upon? i do not believe that books, music, movies, or magazines should ever be censored. it is the choice of the individual to read, listen, or watch a certain material.      the government's opinion of whether something should be censored or not has changed over time. the novel, 'the @caps of @organization' was onced censored and banned by the government for it contained language and scenes that were viewed as inappropriate for readers. if this work were to remain banned, this canon of american culture, the effect that it had on american literature to this day would have been lost.      i see literature as another form of art. art should never be censored, for the lack of it will halt all developments in our society. artists are ones to take risks and so are writers. if people were not allowed to take risks, what would become of our society? developments that have been made by researchers, inventors, artists, and writers were once possibly deemed as risk. should we have censored them?     another instance under which censorship had had a negative affect on society and culture was during the @caps regime. music, books, art, movies, everything was censored or banned under @caps's rule. a whole generation was lost under his power, for they were deemed enexceptable just because he did not like them. now, should we put the power of picking what is unexceptable into the hands of one group of people? whole generations of books, music, etc. could be at stake under such principles. there should be no reason that we are not allowed to see, read, or listen to whatever we would like to as a nation.      the government, with the ability to censor libraries, can hinder our exposure to ideas unknown to us. lack of exposure is the cause of a society's ignorance of the world around it. who will stop the government from censoring what could be the next major masterpiece in literature? nothing stopped them from banning 'the @caps of @organization,' so is there limit? this is the question one has to ask themselves, to keep the government from potentially cutting the nation off from future masterpieces.
0.4 removing books from the library because they are offensive is a good idea. i do not agree because, the books should not be gone for good. there should be age limits on books. books that are offensive should be only allowed to adults or a certain age group, this will help with children not being scared, to help keep history around and, freedom of speech.     by making as age limit on certain books, we can keep children inacent and pure. with books such as '@date', kids @num or under should not read that book. @num and under are still nieve. little kids do not know about sex or even pre-marrital sex. with @person and is girlfriend having sex every other chapter, its very inapporite for a child to read. also, with all the torture parts, it would scare a little boy/girl out of his/her mind.     when getting rid of offensive books, we remove history. think about where we would be if anne frank did not write her diary. we would not know how bad hilter really was. we could only assume. with getting rid of books cause they are 'offensive' is a ridiculous reason. books are only offensive to senative people. books keep history alive! think: 'what are we without history?'     finally, freedom of speech is why they should say. authors have the right to write what they want. if the reader does not like it and finds it offensive, then they should not read it. if shake speare, was told he could not write his stories, we would not have the tragety of romeo and juliet. so many books would be lost if someone could write because it was offensive.     book that are too offensive  or inaporite for a child to read there should be a age limit on it. if we get rid of certain books we get rid of certain history as well. getting rid of those books tells a next coming author that freedom of speech does not matter to offenciveness. so keep the books around, its only words
0.6 the library is a very sourceful place but there are just some things that should not be displayed or made veiwable to the public. some topics or other things found in the library are not suitable for every one and should not be allowed in a public place.     first, there should be a censorship on what you can and can not get or look up at a library. what if some one looks up or check out something that should not be seen by others and it ends up in the wrong hands of someone. that person then could end up using the information for the worst. everything that's in the library is not appropriate for all ages.     next, there is a lot of offensive things you can find in the library. so things should be censored so one one ends up gettin hurt. the librarian or any one whos in there @month never know what someone looked up or is planning until after it @month happen or a problem is started. therefore blocks should be put up for things that maybe be harmfull to others.     finally, although people @month feel it's no one eleses business what they research or check out, they should think, it is open to the public and anyone could easily see or go back to what they were looking at. its not fair to be in a public place and get hurt by the offensiveness of some one. people have to think the library is open to children and elderly.     in conclusion, there should be a censorship on what you can find in the library. there is hurtful and inappropriate things that should absolutly not be allowed. most important a library is a place that you should not get offended in by what some one looks up, checks out or even says.
0.4 librarys are filled with hundreds of materials that many @caps like and dislike. books on @person and @caps, @caps. those books are @caps there to offend you they're there to educate you on the subject.           censorship should be only for the youth as an adult you are open to everything. you make your own desicons and live by them. if you feel like a book, a song, a movie, is offensive, then stop reading, listening, or watching. @caps everyone gets offended.          i believe that no citizen has the right to remove anything from a library because of the @num- @caps every one is @num- @caps have diffrent @caps and outlooks on @num- @caps the @caps.     i conclude this by saying that censorship is enforced, but shouldnt be to a great extent, @caps us do what we do, and learn what we learn. in school were forsed to learn what we learn, i believe @caps right to have out side knowledge, but only way that is that we get it from data bases such as computers, books, music, art, etc
0.4 materials, such as books, music, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive! it's a public library. not many people would like to find something that seems to hurt or harm them in any way.      libraries are for people to come in and should be expected to enjoy something, whether it be a book, movie or magazine. when people come in looking for some good information about something, they look forward to finding good tips, and not being let down. example, with something possibly about someone being racist. that's dissapointment to some. noone should have to walk in and find something that offenses them. it's not fair.     now, to parents with children. would you like for your child going into a library that is allowed to look wherever their little heart desires, and they come upon porn or just anything that would be a bad influence on them? i highly doubt it. unless, you just don't care about what your kid reads these days, but to the ones who want their child having a good education, well, you understand my statement.     it's just not fair to the ones who go to a library expected to be satisfied, but instead are let down. it does them no good, and it could make your community look bad. libraries are to help people with information, fun facts, and all around good resources. so, please put the bad books, music, magazines, etc. away!
0.6 'and then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us'. this quote says it all, if everybody had their say in what is offensive or not then everything would be offensive. books are often written for the enjoyment of the reader, and if not that books are for informational purposes. not everybody will have the same views of one book as someone else does, so it would be unfair to not be able to read it because someone else doesn't want you too.     personally i like to read books that interest me, as i can assume most do everyone else. generally to keep my attention, i like to read books with a lot of action and an intense plot. i realize that some people would find this offensive and not acceptable for children, but i consider myself a good kid now and i am not negatively affected by those books i read. when i was a kid in @num grade, i read a book far beyond what most @num graders read. this book contained many vulgar words and even a racial slur, but i was mature enough to handle them. just the other year, the librarian, whom i stay in constant contact with, asked me if she should take the book off the shelf. i told her no, with my reason being that i found it to be a very interesting book! i would have been upset to see a great book no longer be accessable because of some vulgar language, because what it comes down to are just words that express heavy emotion.     many books such as, the dictionary or encyclopedia's are used for informational purposes. these books can also be accessed by children. i myself as a kid have looked through the dictionary looking for 'bad words'. does that make it jusitifiable to remove? even the books we read in school today have 'bad words' in them. when i was a freshman in high school, my @caps teacher talked about how the school board tried to get rid of 'to @caps a @caps', because it had racial slurs and much racism involved. she was very against getting rid of the book because she found the novel to be a very interesting read for her and her students. books just can't be taken out of the hands of high schoolers because some uptight adults think it is offensive, when in all reality they teach great morals and lessons for the youth.      if you take a look at politics you can see that not everybody has the same opinion and some can be very vocal about their's. the same idea can go with any topic in the world today. somebody thinks one way and someone else thinks the complete opposite. this is the issue with taking books off the shelves. one person thinks it is a very offensive book and the other thinks it is a very beneficial book. my personal opinion is that a book is a book and people are going to interperte them differently. so if one book can get taken off the shelves then this will just start a chain reaction until every book is gone. there is no point! if someone shouldn't read that book then they shouldn't be allowed. the answer is as simple as that.     when it comes down to it people are just going to have to get over not having their way, because they want a book removed from the shelf. most people are offended by something and usually not everybody is offended by the same thing, which makes this issue impossible to deal with. there is only one answer to this question of: should the library be censored? the answer is no, just let it be. the book was published so there must have been a good reason behind it. in the end of it all a book is just a book
0.4 many people have different views on censorship. some people believe there are movies, books, newspapers, etc that contain subject matter that is not appropriate for some viewers and that they should keep their writing on certain things to a certain extent or not at all. other people believe people have the right to say what they want when they want, on a topic they believe the be true or not true, or very improtant to them, also called freedom of speech. also people believe that yes, there are some things written out there that should not have been written but they have no control over and to some people it @month be appropriate.      i do believe there are stories written that are not appropriate. but i know that even though i find the subject to not be appropriate or of any use to me, another person will. i know that every person out there is different and has their own beliefs on different things. if people had the power to control what books, magazines, newspapers and movies were in libraries then @person was right, 'we would have no books left on the shelf for any of us'.           certain books, newspapers, movies, and magazines could help certain people and be of interest to certain people no matter what the subject is or how inappropraite it @month be as long as they are along the right age. if the story is plainly about drugs, sex, alcohol, and voilence with really no use to it, then yes i do believe it should be taken off the shelf. you do not know who could get their hands on that movie, book, or article. it could be a little kid and we do not want to open the door for that. people have many different beliefs and i do believe we should not take anything off the shelf that could be of use to anyone, but i also do believe there is a certain extent.
0.6 should certain books, movies, and magazines be removed from library bookshelves if found offensive? i believe that libraries should remove materials that are offensive. libraries are huge public places that share knowledge and entertainment to enormous groups of people who want to expand their knowledge. throughout the @location and other countries there are libraries that hold offensive material. now i strongly believe in throwing out these offensive items because little children could grab one in their hands, there could be people that can be influenced to do stupid activities that they have learned, and some people might steal these items for themselves.     libraries are important resources that tons of different groups of people come to enjoy, relax, and think. now all over the countries libraries have offensive material that should be romoved from their shelves. little children and their parents come to the library because a library is a great way to relieve stress and to let children learn. say there are materials that are not suitable for children so they grab it and started reading. next thing you know your children will have that type of knowlegde and you can't do a thing about it. offensive material are around little kids and parent don't even know. they could gain offensive language or talk about it at school and that material could spread. material like that at the library can harm children brains by brainwashing them.      teenagers are becoming of age to where they might do something regretable. teen often go to the library to meet up with friends, or start on homework. then a person who is inmature spots a book and begins to read. after that he or she thought that it was extremely funny and wants to try it at home, but then gets badly hurt. teens can be influenced by anything and what's worse is that it can start at the library.      then there are people who just come into a library and steal the offensive material for themselves. people like that are inmature and could serve a real problem for the library. once having that item in their grasp; they could post it on the internet and show the whole world what he or she found. offensive material could be easily stoten from a library; if these certain items were not at the library then rebels wouldn't be stealing anything from the library.     libraries are for different people who want to learn and teach others about their newly obtained knowledge. libraries have the absolute best resources a place could have or ever wanted. i don't want such a wonderful resource be tainted by these obsence materials. that is why i strongly believe that certain material  such as books, magazines, movies, and music that are offensive should be removed from libraries.
0.4 my opinion on this subject is its not right. this is a very interesting question. and im going to tell you why i think the way i do. im for it and against it.     okay some people like different things and the other people dont agree on it. thats how things work. if a parent is walking his kid through the mall and goes into a music store and hears the music cussing in it i would not want my kid to be around that and thats what it means by removing something like that because somebody is offened. i totally agree on that. like ciggerettes. kids walk in to go buy candy then they go to pay for it and the back wall is full of tobacco products that the kids can see. once again i would want to remove that from the shelfs.     there would be so many conflicts if this happened. everyone likes different things. so i think everyone is going to get offened by taking things away that looks offensive towards them. this goes from kids to adults. every age would be bothered by this.      now this is my against veiw on this subject. this would make me very mad if i admired something a lot and then come to find out that someone is offened by it so they take it away from the people and that like that object. all this would do is cause problems for everybody and just make everything go bad. thats how its suppost to be. we all have are opinions. we all like different things. we all have to get over it if we dont like it or dont get along with it. thats something we have to take in and suck it up.     so on this subject im for both. i see it both ways because its good and bad. people are just going to have to get over the fact that they have to deal with what they see or hear. its part of life.
0.6 i think there should be no books taken off the shelfs. somethings might be offisive to some people but other people might need those books for a research, projects,etc. people need to read to understand why some people think that somethings are offensive toward other people. every book should be on a book shelf in a public library. everybody has the freedom to choose for thier self, let them decide if it is offensive to them and others.     maybe an author wrote a book about gansters, and their kids. maybe the author wrote the book to give you an inside look on somebody's life. we live in a very diverse world they are going to be different outlooks on the world. the author could be writing the book to show you what that child went throught during that point of life with killings, and violence. that should not be offensive to somebody because they are talking about killings and violence. reading that book should let you see how that child grew up. the book could even change some of the childs parents who are in gangs their minds. it could let them realize how it will have an effect on their childs life later on in life.     i believe the same thing goes for movies and magazines. through reading the magazines and watching movies it could help you. say if you are in a gang and you watch movies and read you would find out what happens to the gang, it could change your thoughts. these books, movies, magazines could show what is going to happen to you. maybe directiors/ writers do these types ot thngs to show you what will happen to you if you continue down the path in gangs and harmful clubs.      why should certain people get to choose if a book, moive, magazine,etc is offensive to some people but not others? i think the only way to fix it is to leave every book on public library shelfs. let the peple who come to the library to read books decide what is right or offensive for them to read. even if library's make a decision somebody is going to get mad and upset. i do not think there is any way to solve an issue like this except letting people read and decided for themself. if they like the book great, if not then  do not read it again or return the book.nobody can decide right from wrong for somebody, only you can do it for your self.
0.4 i personally do not think that books or magazines and such with offensive things about them shouldn't be removed because they give people something to read. most people don't want to read @caps or a novel. some people want to read about crimes, mysterys, and action. there are alot of good movies out there but some of them i can agree with are too offensive to others. i gurantee that movies with comedy in them will be put down about what is being said. for example: @caps @caps to some people is very offensive. the only reason the person would think that the movie is offensive is because they are stubborn people that don't have a life.     i can believe that there are literature materials that are offensive to others, but the person that criticizes others doesn't think that they are offensive to the people that read the books that offened the person that is being offended. books about war to some people are too graffic. but those books about war are probably books about history. i have only started noticing the people that are trying to get rid of those books that they don't like. but back in the @date's people didn't care about what was in a library. they just want something to read. i say leave the librarys alone!
0.4 what race are you? what religion are you? what have you been taught? almost anything like these could be considered offensive. so should these types of things be taken out of libraries?     no, these types of things are everywhere. you just can't get away from them. today you can find so many offensive television shows and commercials. for example the commercials for @caps gum with that @caps woman, some people might consider that offensive. you might ask, '@caps', well there might be a person who has a diesease who can't get that 'clean feeling' and always has bad breath. that person might take offense to these commercials. another example might be television shows, like @organization. some @caps and just other races get offended by these types of things. does that really mean we should get rid of them though?     people everywhere are somehow offended by something, the world isn't perfect. even if we did take out these types of offensive material in libraries, it could still be seen. so whats the point?          if you tried to take it all out, like everywhere in the world everything would be crazy. there is no such thing as a perfect world, i believe if there was people would go crazy. for example in the movie '@caps @caps,' the main character finds a town that is suppose to resemble 'the @caps @caps' or a perfect society. in the town at first everything is nice, but then everyone is so perfect that he can't stand it and leaves.      the best thing to do is let these materials stick around because there is nothing you can do to get them gone from everywhere else. also they help kids learn, if you keep them locked up and not knowing anything, then how far are they going to get in life?     so should these things go away or not? what do you think?
0.6 all things in the world are not strictly black and white. every person is different, with varying ideas. so when some people are certain that a specific word or topic should be restricted, there will always be another person to say the exact opposite. sometimes, what's found as 'vulgar' can only be introduced with the intent of education. also, this ties in with something our country was founded on, which is freedom of the speech, and the press.      magazines, music, books and movies are mainly for entertainment. everyone who reads or watches something will take it in differently, and it will have a varying effect. let's say there is a @num-year-old girl who just had her first day of high school. while at lunch, she slipped and dropped her tray of food. later that day while she's alone reading her favorite magazine, she's reading an article about embarrassing stories, where one girl accidentally walked into a boys' restroom. some parents @month deem this inappropriate, but it has made the young girl feel better about her situation.      it's human to mess up and act crazy; we aren't perfect by nature. so when we see errors made into comedies and dramas by any form of media, it's human to realize that we aren't the only ones who undergo these events. to censor books and televisions would be like claiming nothing bad happens. not to say that a novel written about brutal murder that contains sexual references should be given to a little kid, but it should not be pulled from the shelf all together.      the topic of censorship in schools is also a very sensitive one, especially with younger kids. as katherine paterson pointed out, if every parent had the right to remove a book that they thought was not suitable, then eventually there would be nothing left. many parents are uneasy with the thought of their child being taught things like sexual education, but on the other hand, there are also the parents who appreciate it. they do so not because it saves them time, but because certain explicit topics - to an extent - can help someone mature if it's done in a controlled environment.      years ago, it was not uncommon to see censorship in the media. it could range from saying 'intercourse' to replace 'sex' or it could be something like extreme propoganda. there's a reason that our consitution protects freedom of speech. no matter how appauling someone @month find a topic, it usually has some type of informative purpose. otherwise, it probably wouldn't have gotten issued.      choosing what is and isn't offensive is a matter of opinion. as previously stated, no two humans are exactly the same, and their opinions won't be either. so this means that if one person out of a group is allowed to dispose of or censor whatever they find necessary, it must be recognized that some portion of the remaining people will be unsatisfied. this is usually where people will claim that the law protects their freedom of speech. in the end, the media is largely for entertainment. it provides numerous shows and articles, with a huge array of topics. this goes to show that if one should find something offensive, it doesn't mean they have to rip it off the shelves and complain; it simply means they have the opportunity look elsewhere
0.4 i do not think that a random stranger should have the right to decide what books to allow in a public library. if they have a problem with certain material in certiain books they should bring it to the attention of the library. the auther who wrote that book has the freedom of speech, and they are allowed to write anything that they would like to write. if somebody did not want their children looking at a book, or reading that book, then they should just tell their child to stay away from it, and if they raised their child properly, he or she should respect those boundries that the parents have set.     however, i think there should be a line drawn about what is too graphic to be displayed at a public library. some magazines that contain graphic material are very educational, such as @organization. on the other hand, i am not saying that we should be lining shelves with @caps magazines either. there is a difference between having books that educate children about other cultures, and those that educate them about sex and explicit material. it is the adults job to protect their children from material such as that. but they can do it in another way, other than taking the book off the shelf.     even if the book is filled with drugs or nudity, the concerned parent cannot just take actions into their own hands. the owner of the library is the adult that gets to decide what types of books or magazines he or she allows in the library, not the customers. i think that if you are offended by a certain book at a library, you should bring it to the attention of the owner, or simply go to a different library. if the owner refuses to remove the item from the shelf and the material offends you that much, you could go to court and plead your case to the judge. but you have no right to remove a book from a shelf that does not belong to you.
0.4 there's bad, and good books out there. some people find different books affensive, to what they do. other's like the books that other people dislike. in a way books are both bad and good. good, because people start to read better after reading a lot, and bad because a lot of people dislike to read.     i think that when you go in a library there should be impropet books for people to read. children go in library's, what if they pick up a bad book and form horriable habits? children, and adults have very different views on what to read. kids want to read fairytale stories, etc. adult's on otherhand enjoy mystery storys about murder, and such.     yes, library's can let people check out any book they find interesting; but, what if that book is bad for there children to see lying around. it's simple if you make sure you don't leave your books just lying anywhere, kid's wouldn't form bad habits, or discover anything there not suppose to know. kid's are noises, and they will try to read your books, or see something bad on a magizine.     in library's, there is the children's section, and the adult section. that helps in some way's, but your child can still find that bad book, etc at home. parents can keep from this for the safety of there childrens thought's, or qeustions about that certain book, etc that they found. it's good to just put thing's away when your done, and keep every bad book, etc out of your childs react.     books are bad, and good. you can find the information you need, or something you really don't want to read about, or see. books have stuff that we sometime's need to know, and want to know more about. if your kid finds a misleading book, make sure they didn't read it, or look at it; and just hide it away from them. in the end, the problem will be solved.
0.4 in my opinion everyone should have a right to go to the library and get whatever book, magazine, movie, and music they what. people go to the library for a lot of reason computers, books, etc. also having a public library comes handy for people that don't have a computer at home. it's a public library you should be able to go there an find about anything you need book or movie wise.     everyone has differnt likes an interests about their books or movies, and i'm sure people go to the library an expect them to have what they are looking for. some people do go to the library an not find what there looking for. then people get mad an upset cause they figured the library would have it an they don't. but yes i think that there should be any kind of magazine, movie, or book at the library that you need. i mean it's a library they should have it all.     also people have the right to go get whatever book, or movie they want. it's called freedom everyone is diffrent and everyone likes diffrent things. there has been a few times i have went to our library to find books or movies an they didn't have them. you would think that a library would have a book or movie over trying to potty train a toddler, but they didn't.     i think that they should have any an every kind of book, magazine, an movie you want at the library. yeah some people @month take offense to it but who cares obviously they don't want it so leave it an go get what you want. just cause you don't like it don't mean other people don't. so no i don't think just cause some people don't like them they should be removed from the shelves.     so no i absolutely do not think that any books, movies, magazines should be removed from the shevles. you are who  you are an you like what you like it shoudn't matter what other people think about it as long as it's what you like. so in my opinion the library should be a good use to everyone, and leave the books, magazines, etc. on the shevles for the people who do like to read or watch them
0.6 censorship in the @caps     @caps, what is offensive to some @month not be to others. so how do we know when expressing ourselves in an artistic manner that we've gone to far? we don't and thats why censorship is such a controversial topic.      in the music industry recently there has been messages in songs and music videos that aren't the best suited for teenagers. being a teenager is a time of constant turmoil in one's life, you are required to make decisions that will define you as a person. when songs out there are about drug use and other crimes teens see them as cool things and follow along cause they see them as everyday activities that can do no harm but little do they know that they are wrecking their life by doing this, so i somewhat agree with censorship in that kind of thing.     in literature and art things take a more serious tone than in music and other media. with literature it's about conveying ones thoughts and feelings about a story or other subject. in art you express yourself vissually on a canvas or abstractly through other materials and forms, but in both ways you express your feelings and emotins. so censoring these would in turn censor one voice and emotions. when you take away a man's voice and emotions you are left with an empty shell of a person who will never know life to the fullest.     as time has changed i have found that people have also changed. when @person uses the '@caps-word' in some of his literary works it didn't offend people at the time, but now times have changed. now it's not ok that @person used this word but on the other hand it's ok for rappers and others to say it every other word in their music. so how do we know what's offensive and what's not? well it's all from the reader, listener, or viewer's point of view.     these days parents try to sheild their children from the outside world and make it seem that it's all rainbows and butterflies by censoring things the children might be subject to read, hear, or see in their day to day lives. this does not solve the problems in the world there will always be war, crime, and death no matter how hard we try to stop it as long as there's 'good' there will always be 'bad'.     all loyalties aside in my honest opinion i believe censorship in the @caps is a bad idea and will never work to solve actual problems with the world. it will just cover them up just like the dialouge or image they so badly want to go away.
0.6 if i found a book that i thought was innapropiate for others to read, i would ask the librarian to check into to see what she thinks about the book(s). if she believed they were offensive, then she could remove the book(s) without any questions being asked. if she was in the middle on a book and didn't know whether she should remove, she could take a vote or tally on that book and then go from there to see if it did needed removed. the only way i would find a book to be offensive is if it had pictures that were not appropiate for people to look at and it also depends on how old you are. another offensive object would be too many words that involved foul language and or racism.      if i found a movie that was offensive, i would just ask that it would be moved to a place that only mature adults should watch or some teenagers. my opinion can't remove an object from its place unless there were multiple complaints about the book or movie and ect. some movies and books should be removed from shelves because younger kids get a hold of these movies ans watch them and then go out into the real world and do these bad actions that was on the film. for example, if the movie/book was about drugs, then some kids would think it was alright for them to do because they  saw it on tv. some kids even get killed because they go out and try these dumb ideas they got from the book and or movie. but the parents also play a role by letting their kid watch these, i think if they would watch what their children do, then some of this won't happen.      music is another big thing that is becoming more and more out of control with offensive subjects. there is more foul language in music as it progresses. @num years ago, it wasn't that bad, but it's getting worse. i think some music should be banned because of the violence and sexual content it describes on the music. some of the music i listen to, i just want to run it over with my vehicle because the whole song was about drugs, sexual content and or violence. i don't even know why an artist would want to write a song about bad content because they know younger people will hear it. i think offensive music has an effect on the violence that actually occurs in today's society because there might be some racism. i'm not trying to blame the artists or say it their fault, but i think they should think twice about their songs before they release it so everyone can listen to it.     everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but some things should not be on the shelves for our kids and children to listen to and or watch. i think there will be something done, but it will take time
0.2 in our socioty, a lot of people and places take offense to certain things. in my opinion, librarys and book stores should not remove things from their shelves becuase they could be offensive.     people have the right to pick something up, over look it, and decide wheither it's offensive or not. if a book or movie that someone wrote or directed could get to them bad enough for them to freak out and complain to places that are selling it, then that book or movie probably shouldnt have been made.     i agree, somethings are offensive, but if someone you dont know wrote it or directed it, then dont let it bother you. i believe that music is a way that people express themselves. i honestly don't think that music should be censored when it's sold in any store. if the material is to graphic for children or some people, then don't listen to it. if you need things to be censored because of words or topics just so you can read, listen, or watch them, then maybe you just should do it.
0.2 i think that if there are offensive books, music, magazines, etc then they should be put in a section of their own, or the librarians should have them kept up and if someone needs/wants them then they would have to go to the front dest in order to get them. i think also, if a young child or teenager cant see, read or hear those types of things than they should not be in there period
0.6 have you ever read or seen a book that you thought was not appropriate? did you want to ban the book from the library you got it from? well many people have experienced this and many of them have wanted to have more sensorship in libraries but we can not always do this. maybe that book that you just put down, deeming it inappropriate for all to read it, is someone else's favorite book. you @month never know but maybe someone might think your favorite book is not appropriate. there are many different people in the world and they all have different opinions. so instead of banning them how about libraries and schools just sensor them.      censoring seems like a no brainer but a lot of people do not think about it. we can not just close our eyes to all the inappropriate books out there but we can at least censor them. censoring them could be as simple as just putting a tag on them or making a different section for just those kinds of books. the tags should be clearly marked so that people can see it and know what to expect from the book.                    people do not have to get rid of some books completely but they need to recognize that young children could pick it up and start reading it without knowing that it is not very appropriate for them. parents do have the right to check and monitor what their child is reading. although if you just get rid of the book completely, people are also getting rid of other people's freedom of speech. no one has the right to determine what books are not appropriate and what books are, so no one should have the right to just have certain books just removed from the shelves.      instead of banning the books or complaining about it them, people could try a rating system for books. when you buy movies a lot of times people check the rating on the movie to see if it would be appropriate for their child or even for themselves. this is what we could do with books too and maybe there will not be as many problems with books. it sounds simple enough but people need to take action and start to do something about it.     you @month not be able to make everyone happy but at least people can be more informed about the books they are reading. if everyone can help out in the effort to make our libraries and school more censored than all the libraries would be a lot happier places full of adventure
0.2 i think that if the books,music,magazines,or movies you have in a library is not offensive, then they have the right to put them on the shelfs.theres nothing wrong wit havin music and magazines at a library because what if someone doesnt like to read but loves listening to music or doesnt like to read books but likes to read magazines.i think its all right to have movies too.they could have alot of educational movies of just some plain regular movies of all kinds.now if a book or movie or magazine or music was found and it was offensive then they should be takin off the shelf.if the books,music,movies, or magazines are not offensive in any way, they have the right to be on does shelfs so everyone can use them.
0.4 books, music, movies, magazine, ect. shouldnt be taken off the shelves simply because they are offensive or because children can get their hands on them and repeat what they have read, seen, or herd. they should stay only because these so called 'offensive' objects that we have obtained can teach us very useful things such as what to do and what not to do and teaches us about our history or another countrys history. it is true there are some things in a library that children shouldnt see yet but whats to stop them from taking a look anyway? there are people who crave this offensive knowldge but are told time and time again they are not old or mature enough to handle such things but in more ways than one and it has been proven that some people thrive better with the true that holds violence than it being hidden from them. without these things children will never know what is really going on in the world around them and will be too shocked to do anything if they end up in the middle of something dangeroius and without the correct knowledg on how to handle it or where to go. that is exactly why the offensive things should stay in the library.
0.2 no, materials should not be removed from the libraries.first most of books,movies and,music are the best way to support difffernt things.they all have there type of way of convinicing you.there are many different ways to understand but those are certainly the best ways.                          like a movie some people like to see things to understand them.because it take times for some people to see instead of reading or listening.it take people to just seat and watch is a great way.some people that look at a movie an a wrong way get the wrong type of thought about something which make it offensive to them.                                                                    like music is a great way to understand what someone is trying to say or get across.you have to take time out to really listen and here what they are taking about.if you here a song once and then you just take it a wrong way u never let your mind here what they said.some people let one word or two make u think differnt about the song.so before u judge listen to the whole song.     a book one of the worlds best way to understand were someone is comeing from.a book is like a short life.if judge a book bye its first couple paragraphs you would never get a meaning out of it.with a book you have to give it a chance to seek in your mind so that you do get an understanding.a book can tell u alot of things.so some people take it offensive.     these types of materials should never be removed from labraries.this things are great ways to understand things.so if you take one thing offensive try another way maybe its a better way for people to understand it.without this materials we would never understond,discovery anythong in are worl
0.6 censorship in libraries is when a librarian has the right to remove certain materials, such as books, movies, music, magazines, etc., from the shelves of a library, if the item is inapropiate.  i believe that libraries should not have censorship.      i personally, think that it should be up to the library if they could have that power. if it is a library were there's always smaller children their, then i think they could have the power of censorship. in conclusion, it should be the parents of the smaller children's responsibility to make sure their child's book is appropiate for there son or daughter.     now, say if it was just a normal library with both a mixture of both grown-ups and children, then i would say there still is no need at all for a censorship. first in for most, because its your choice of the item, if you think it is offensive then simply do not read it, watch it or listen to it.     second of all, it wouldn't be fair to the people in the library who liked a certain item, but could no longer use that item just because one person thought it was offensive. also people would just start saying they thought that item was not suited for the library just because they did not like it period.      last of all, members of the library would have the same right as the librarians. so many of all the members have such different feelings on items, that so many different items would be taken off the shelf, that by the end there would be no books left.     in conclusion, personally i do not think censorship is necessary in libraries. it would not be needed because smaller children's parents should be responsible enough check the child's items, and also because there would be so much conflict with what items were taken of the shelf and how many items were taken off the shelf. there for, i believe cencorship is not need in libraries.
0.6 i know that some people find some books offensive mean cruel or racist but most of the time people write @caps beacuase its what they feel or what people want to read. books are a privlige and we should be able to use that privledge. people need to learn that its ok that books are sometimes are a little harsh. the @caps is not the most friendly place ever and books can help convay that with less hurt then  experencing @caps first hand.   i know that all books should be left on the shelfs becuase just because its offensive to someone doesnt mean that you should take @caps off. for every book someone will find @caps offensive because of somthing. if the cause is if its offensive then all books should be gone. if someone took the time to go out and write and book and make sure that everything about @caps is correct then why should we stop them from letting people read @caps. they have a right to write @caps and we have a right to read @caps and no one should take that right away. if someone wrote a book on the hollocost people are very offended by that but they dont try to get ride of @caps. so why should any book be different because its not a big event like @caps @caps @caps. its just seem so upserd that people who go to such lengths to get rid of a book just because they are offended by @caps. i think they just need to suck @caps up and move on. if they dont like @caps then dont read @caps. someone who wants to can so do not take that away from the people that want to read @caps.      i remember a time when someone wanted to read a book in are library and they said,'oh you cant read that because @caps was found to offencive.' @caps made me uphald that they would deciede how someone els feels about a book. @caps makes me so angry that they get to dicied how someone els feels about a book. they must be magic becuase i did not know that they know how someone els feels about a book or anything for that matter. we do have books here that are kept behind the librarians desk that if you really wanted to read that book its behind her desk. and im ok with that beacuse at least they have @caps for people to read if they really wanted to. this is what i think should happen if they have books that they think is too offensive to people. at least try to give an effert to perserve are right as citizens of the @organization.     lets throw an other aspect here about money. the book that you want so badly gone from a library was most likely payed by you, the tax payer. so you and a lot of others payed for this book and now you want to wast that money. that is just insane that you would want to wast that money after @caps being payed for. this just make me want to say wow do you really want to be that upset about a book. does @caps make you feel better that you got all worked up over a book and now its gone. well good for you mission accomplished. all you did was get worked up and you wasted money. people just need to relize the bigger picture not just themselfs but others. in them taking down a book because you were offended, offends me. this offends me a large amount because now you ruined somthing that was not nessisary to be taken down.     this is how i feel about this subject. i am very upset that people would do this and go to such lengths to ban a book away from a library. if you wrote a book and people did this to you how would you feel. i know that you would feel like dirt that someone would do this to your hard work. people need to just calm down and smell the roses and forget about things that do not matter. stand back and think for a second and say,'will this really effect me if i get this book taken off the shelf.' @caps also make me mad that the libary bought the book and now its gone so did the money just go to waist becuase the book is just gone. this is how i feel on the matter of getting ride of books.
0.8 do citizens have the right to remove books, magazines, and other materials from shelves because they personally do not agree with the content? censorship in libraries is a subject with an unclear answer.  some believe it is in their right to get rid of books, music, and movies with what they believe is 'offensive' material. others think library censorship is wrong, that people should have access to whatever material they please. censorship is simply a way of preventing knowledge from those who wish to learn more about worlds outside their own.     in @date's society, there are no limits. the human imagination can create beautiful works of literary art and music, but it can also create material not suitable for every age group. library censorship is a way to keep this 'unsuitable' material away from young and curious eyes. however, what @month be unacceptable for children to view @month be perfectly fine for a mature adult. censorship is purely opinion. if a person is a strict believer that @caps created the world in seven days, they might find it offensive to see a book or a movie that supports the theory of evolution. if a parent does not want their child to watch @caps, they would rather their children not see a @caps disk in the children's section for their child to see. if one person harbors a profound grudge against @caps, it is unfair to others if all @caps content is removed from a library's shelves. if a person does not wish to have access to certain 'offensive' subjects, then they do not have to expose themselves to it. but it is not in their rights to remove it from the view of others who @month wish to educate themselves on the said matters.     writing is a form of self- expression, a method by which to convey feelings and thoughts and share them with others. it is also a way to teach and to inform others about the past. but if what is written is not shared, how can one form their own opinions and thoughts when they are not exposed to the opinions of those outside their community? it is unfair to prevent someone from learning about a certain subject simply because one or two other people oppose the content. if books and movies containing information unacceptable to one person were removed, then everyone else has the right to have material of their choice removed as well. eventually, there would be nothing left because everyone is offended by one thing or another. that is one of the beauties of being an @caps citizen: freedom of speech. by living in @location, one has the right to read or learn about whatever they please. censorship prevents learning from those who want it.     parents are possibly some of the biggest advocates of library censorship. not wanting their children to be exposed to explicit or graphic material is understandable. but just because they do not want their child to see a movie about devil worship or the @caps era does not mean the parent has the right to prevent all others from seeing it. children need to be exposed to these kinds of things at some point to encourage open- mindedness and acceptance of others. libraries provide a source by which young people can educate themselves on the religions, beliefs, and customs of the outside world. it should not be up to the parents to decide what is put on the library shelves; if they do not want their children to have access to certain subjects, do not allow them to go to the library.      in conclusion, one can say library censorship is a matter of opinion. citizens have a right to read, listen to, or watch whatever material they please. granted, it is acceptable for parents to shield their children from certain subjects, but it is unaccepable for those same parents to prevent others in the community from learning. freedom to express one's opinions in the form of literature means nothing if that literature cannot be shared with others. as katherine paterson once said, '... and then we have no bookes left of the shelf for any of us.
0.6 we all hope that one day our children will not pick up a book or a magazine their not suppose to read. children don't know any better. but why should we have to have movies, books and etc censored, cause their little children every where. if i had the right to keep the books and etc on the shelf i would.      i think that we should be able to have books that are uncensored on the shelfs. if everything was censored we would really have nothing to read or to watch. having everything censored thats just not fair to the world. everyone should be able to watch what ever they want with out it having to be censored. if people favorite movies or music was censored it probably wouldnt be that funny to them anymore, they'll most likely just stop watching it.     i don't believe that they should have a censorship in libraries. certain materials in like cd's songs do come off little offensive sometimes, but that's just life. if you think it's offensive then just don't listen to it. that doesnt mean that they have to take it off the shelf. maybe other people like that kind of music or etc. that doesnt mean they have a right just to take it off cause of that. if they did that's just really unfair.     children now days see more and know more what they are not suppose to know, for an example cursing. if a child happen to see cursing in a magazine at the library and their parents got mad that was in the magazine. the parent shouldnt really be mad and take that offensive, and think that not suppose to be in their. the library shouldn't have to censor thing's cause of that incident. the children will hear it or see it again soon or later.      i would keep the right for the libraires to have things uncensored, if i had the decision. those are some ideas why i think they shouldnt have to censor movies, music etc in the library.
0.2 yes we should keep the books,music,movies,an magazines.     the magazines an music might not be a good thing for some us for must people use music to consutrate on doing work an magazines help us on getting topics for class work. why would some one take books or any thing that help us in life, so the person who wants to take book away should live the books or anything eles alone. so to this yes we should keep the books,music,movies, an magazines on the shelfs. we need to start fighting for what we want an how we want it should not be know ones eles chioc to deside what is good for us.
0.333333333333 the features of the setting affect the cyclist very much so! the cyclist is riding through the hot desert. meaning he needs lots of cold water to keep him hydrated. the longer he rides in the hot sun, the more he sweats, the more likely he will get dehydrated. if he was riding in the rain or snow it could possibly slow him down also, because he would be cold and his muscles might get stiff and not be able to move as fast. this is why the setting affects the cyclist very much so. 
1.0 there was many features that affected the cyclist such as heat and lack of water. the cyclist was drinking a lot of water throughout the story and ends up only having little water left.  i eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.  that shows he wasn t prepared with enough water for his trip to yosemite. without water he/she would die from the heat.  wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that i could drop from heat stroke  this states that he @caps the danger of not having enough water in his system. features such as water and heat affected him/her throughout the story. not having enough water could make him/her lose more sweat and the heat is making him lose even more sweat which can cause extreme heatstroke.
0.0 understanding, realitic, mode-all are reason s how setting affects the setting. if a book has a good setting then the book might be pretty good. when you have a setting it s more understable of what they are trying today. and if you have a good setting it makes it more realitic so when you read it you wont be thrown off, the mode of the story sets it all off, because usually books have there ups and downs. that s why they chase the mode.  
0.333333333333 the setting effects the cyclist because he is in the desert with no water and doesnt know where he is going. the old men on the porch gave him wrong directions now he is lost in the desert. the cyclist find the will power to keep on moving and he finds help along the way. he finds another old man there that offer him directions but he says he has a map
0.666666666667 the features of the setting affect the cyclist alot. the hot sun beating down on him makes him sweat and makes him thirsty. the bumpy roods and hills make him work harder. the abandoned places make him lose hope. if faced with these obstacles i would have been affected in the same way. as i believe any human would be.
0.666666666667 the settings that affected the cyclist were in fact ones you don t want to be near when you are out of water and tired from pedaling. the time and place affected him greatly because there wasn t a cool breeze in the air in june at california. he was in the middle of flat deserts and had no sense of where the part as and where civilization too so he can get some water. the quote  old timers who haven t left the confines of their porches since carter was in office  helped you realize taking advice of direction from old people who don t go anywhere is a bad idea.  flat road was replaced by short rolling hills . this quote shows you some terrail features that affected the cyclist. furthermore, the cyclist realivingly found civilization with running water.
0.666666666667 the setting affected the cyclist because of the rode conditions. the rode was all messed up. 
0.333333333333 in the story  do not exceed posted speed limit  the features of the setting affected the cyclist. for example, the cyclist traveled miles on a bike dealing with the weather in the deserts, little bit of water, and being tired. the cyclist faced many hard times trying to travel on a bicycle from one point to another.
0.333333333333 sun, amount of miles, people all are reasons why the setting affects the cyclist. for example, the sun was beating down on him every time and the cyclist seemed to complain that it was so hot. also, he said that he really didn t seem to notice it through in his mind it affected the cyclist. next, the amount of miles that the cyclist was biking affected him mentally because people kept,
1.0 the setting in  rough road ahead: do not exceed posted speed limit  was a very large factor of the story that was actually the cause of the protagonist s problem throughout. first it started off with the large hills he had to ride up, making him work harder and tire himself out quickly. next the big problem was the heat of june,   and the growing realization that i could drop from a heatstroke on a gorgeous day in june simply because   the heat was so really bad because it made him hot, thus depleting his water supply  which he needed to survive  and it gave the large, almost inevitable risk of falling from a heatstroke and dying. the heat also made the abandoned juice factory all the more ironic and bitter for the protagonist.  a sand blasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still be seen.  @caps, in the unbearable heat with no water left and @caps knows how many miles left to cycle, this really made him feel like the sorriest, unluckiest man in the world. the setting overall, seemed almost crafted to make the protagonist not only suffer from the natural elements, but from things that seemed meant purely taunt him for it. 
1.0 the features in the setting of  rough road ahead  affect the cyclist. first of all, the weather causes most of his problems. since the cyclist was biking in a california desert in june the temperature had to be in the @num's. this causes him to become dehydrated, which is evident when he states,  i had been hitting my water bottles quite regularly  the heat therefore causes the cyclist to drive excessively and run out of water, also, the objects the cyclsit comes across on his journey affect him. for example, while riding on a rough path,  a ridiculously large snake blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me.  this saves the biker progress and most likely scared him. the cyclsit is greatly affected by the features in the story setting.
1.0 the setting of the essay didn t really help the author at all on his journey. there were not many structures on the way. either that, of the towns said to be,  a ghost town.  @caps this couldn t have reassured the author that things were going his way. it also was very hot during his journey. the author says he is  traveling through the deserts of california in june.  deserts are very hot places and june is during summer which is the hottest month so it had to have been extremely hot and humid. @caps all this must have taken a toll because he never really saw anything reassuring until the last town he reached with the bait store. so the setting definitely had to have affected his confidence and his energy levels.
0.666666666667 the features of the setting affect the cyclist by the mood the cyclist and what happens as he journeys in the desert to a town. for example his mood changes when the old man asks him for a map and his attitude changes by cautiousness of the new, of the new road he went on then terror when he thought he was gonna die   i was gonna die and the birds would pick me clean  then to pride when the old man asks for a map and the author says  i own a very good map  but as he journeys to yosemite the setting changes when he goes to a  desert type of place then goes a bait shop to rest. then probably on his merry way to his destination.
0.666666666667 'do not exceed the posted speed limit  by joe kurmaskie demonstrated that the features of the setting affected the cyclist a great deal. first off, the cyclist was in the desert on a bicycle. this affected her because if they had been in a car, or on a bus alot less energy would have been used up. secondly, the cyclist started running out of water. this setting didn t help because they were on a bike so that kept them hydrated. another setting that affected the plot was the deserted towns. if they hadn t been deserted everything would have been better. these features affected the cyclist a great deal.
0.666666666667 in the essay  rough road ahead do not exceed posted speed limit  by joe kurmaskie the setting affects the cyclist in various different ways. first of all he listened to the old man so he was on the wrong path. so he travels and it s a hot june day in california deserts. the odds are against him from the start  the water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips, wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that i needed a drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in june  (kurmaskie @num) from the ganle you can tell that hes tired and almost out of water. it puts a lot of strain on the cyclist but he manages.
1.0 the settings have a huge affect on the cyclist. when he first comes to the  @caps town  he isn t really warried he is kind of laughing and thinks his funny by saying.  this place might have been a thriving little spot at one time  - say, before the last world war.  then after he says that it ways he chuckled. when he gets the dark in the road with the risky pipe of water he begins to switch into conservation made and begins to get is scared. he says.  i would comer  water- a test at my inner spirit   this showing that he was scared. after he sees the abanoned grape juice factory he says something like birds are going to pick him clean and leave behind same expensive biking gear. this definatly shows that he is giving up. another thing that would back this up is when he talks about writing in his diary about the old men who gives him these direction. when he finally reaches the balt shop he is releved and goes to the bathrom and drinks water. he  also says that he will buy bait even though he doesn t have a rod. these examples show the many ways the setting affected the cyclist.
0.666666666667 in this i will tell you how the cyclist was being effected. one way is the heat caused him to drink more then her ran out of water. the next was is the misleading old guys that gave him ba directions. another way was being the long distance and bad terrain slowing him down. the last reason is the snake that slowed him down.
0.333333333333 the features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. he was riding his bike across a place with no cars, no people, no water, or no food. it was a dangerous journey for him but he made it.
0.333333333333 the features of the setting can affect the cyclist because, say that there was nothing. it might make you want to go faster and left out your inner speed demon. that s all i can really tell you. because personally i don t think the setting of where you ride your bike doesn t even matter. possibly for a bicyclist it can, but to me i don t even think so.
0.333333333333 in the essay  do not exceed posted spedd limit  by @person many features of the setting effect the cyclist. first, when he arrived at the first  town  and said,  this place might have been a thriving little spot at one time   say, before the last world war.  this deserted ghost town setting was like a joke and had a small effect on the cyclist because it was the beginning of the day and he still had a good water supply. though when he arrived at the ramshackle shed surrounded by several rusty pumps the effect it had wasn t so mild. he says,  the sight was troubling.  then when he got on his hands and knees and started working the pump the situation didn t get much better. all that came out was a drop or two that tasted like battery acid. lastly, when he arrived at an abandoned welch s grape juice factory after several miles. this had a very wearing effect on him since the water supply was low and he had cycled into disappointment after disappointment. this setting in this essay seemed very abandoned and hopeless. it was only determination that got this cyclist through it.
1.0 the features of the setting in,  rough road ahead  affect the cyclist. the cyclist started at a camp ground and conversing with some old dogers, and he asks them how to get to yosemite, and the tell him a shortcut that turns out to be out of date. on the road to yosemite he sees nothing except abandoned towns. he is really thirsty and there s no water anywhere. he thought he was going to die. he said,  i was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.  it was a hot summer day and there was tumbleweeds and snakes by the road and him feel hotter and more thirsty than he would be if it was cooler and if there was a big river flowing by the road. but it was hot and dry in california and desert-like and it made him feel like he was dying because he was in the middle of nowhere therefore the setting affected the cyclist
0.666666666667 the features of setting affect the cyclist in many ways. at first when he sees the tall pines and the river he is calm: and chilled out. but when he sees the abandoned  @person s grape juice  factory he becomes desperate and thinks he is going to die out in the desert. a guy travels to @organization where he meets  old timers and the give him a  shortcut  to the park. he then goes on his bike to the park taking their  shortcut.  while traveling starts to run out of water and then he thinks he is going to die out in the desert.  it din t really matter. i was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.  this quote means now that he is out in the desert he thinks he is going to die since he has no more water. this relates because he becomes desperate  for water because he is out in the desert in the midde of june.
0.333333333333 the features of the setting affect the cyclist by the hottnes of the deserts of california because the cyclist was sweating, and drinking his water bottles. also when the cyclist saw the building, he thought he could rest and maybe get a ride to where he was going but, the building was abandoned years earlier so the cyclist couldn t stop. these are some features of the setting that affect the cyclist.
0.333333333333 the setting affected the cyclist in a big way during his journey. the temperature being so hot tired the cyclist and made him thirsty. also the hills being so high to ride up made it hard to continue. since he was in the desert there were not many towns to go to. all these factors affected the cyclist on his journey.
0.333333333333 there were many features that affect the cyclist. lack of water slowed him down. also the hills and sun were a big problem.
0.666666666667 in the story  do not exceed posted speed limit,  the featurs of the setting had a great deal to do with the cyclist. the rodes were bumpy, windy, and many hills. as the effect of that the cyclist had to drink a lot of water. as the cyclist rode into the so called town he found nothing, as he says  i began to pump the old rusted water pump, but nothing came out except nasty blackish water. 
0.666666666667 the features of the setting effected the cyclist quite durastrely. first of all, he was  traveling through the high deserts of california in june.  he was running out of water and the pump he found only produced.  brakish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.  and  had the flavor of battery acid.  then he came upon  rolling  hills  and  rough @caps.  by the end, he was exausted, dehidrated, and in desperate need of water. the turain made the story more meaning full in proving that you souldn t get directions from old guys. 
0.666666666667 the features of the setting affect the cyclist by making his travel a lot harder. the weather was very hot making him very thirsty and due to the towns being abandoned, he could not stock up on water. the terrain that he had to cross had many hills and the road was not in good condition. with the heat, lack of water, ghost towns, and tough terrains, made his journey a very hard achievement to overcome. with all these obstacles in his way, he was able to achieve his goal of getting water.
1.0 the features of the setting affect the cyclist for a few reasons. one reason is that it makes it easier to picture how the cyclist feels. also it makes the cyclist seem a bit insane for doing what he s doing in weather that he could,  drop from heatstroke.  @caps reason is that the weather is affecting the cyclist so bad that he s seeing a mirage of a  building-abandoned years ealier.  the features of the setting affect the cyclist because the conditions seem impossible to make it in.
0.333333333333 setting was a important factor in the story. i was a dessert in a dessert there is a lack of water. and me was in a bike that is dangerous. because you are using your feet to move which takes out energy, and uses water from your body.

1.0 the features of a setting could be a number of different things. it could be snowing and cold, raining and of course wet, hot and dry, breezy and humid. the features could be a busy tough or a solitere country road, there could be rough terrain or straight aways. the setting of a place puts pressure of the reality of what will happen on a cyclist. in the essay a young cyclist takes advice from some elderly man and ends up riding through hot sun and ghost towns not knowing if he would survive. the heat had him feeling as though death were coming on him and the thirst had him becoming more determined to get to the next town so he could survive. if the features of the setting had been different, say he was riding on a flat road in a busy town with a breeze and places to stop for water everywhere he would not have feared for his life. the features of the setting affect how the cyclist feels and thinks. he can feel angry, happy, sad or scared and he can start to think about his own death. these have been what i believe some of the effects settings have on cyclist.
0.666666666667 the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. for example when the author says  flat roads were replace by short rolling hills , that made the author have to ride safer. also, when he says,  the ridiculously large snake blocked the majority of the pavement.  the author had to slow down on his bike and find a safe way around it so he could get past. finally when the author says  no one in sight , no building, car, or structure , he is affected because he can t ask questions since hes lost and hes thirsty. the setting makes it hard for the author to maneuver and get to where he wants to go.

1.0 during the authors ride to yosemite, he doesn t have the proper tools to go along the long stretch of desert he was to face, and by tools i mean water. the california desert is extremely hot and can be potentially dangerous depending on your situation the author was describing how the lack of water was affecting him. he described this with sentences like  rattled around the dry honey combs of my deteriorating brain.  the author clearly cannot face the rugged heat with his immense lack of water. the author was getting neat stroke being passed by @location  desert snakes and tumbleweeds. the author was clearly in a struggle against the @location desert heat.

0.666666666667 the cyclist had a hard trail to bike in order to get to @location. it is easy to bike if you are on flat smoot terrain, when you get to rolling hills, it makes it a lot tougher. the biker said  i noticed the terrain changing. flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills. it was also very hot. he was sweating and getting dehydrated,  i d read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind of thirst.  he had eighteen miles to next town without much water. the first deserted town didn t have any drinkable water. it was very hard to bike in these conditions, and is important to always be prepared and know were you are going.

1.0 the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. for one, a lot of the settings discoured the cyclist.  this place might have been a thriving little spot at one time- say, before the last world war- but on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town. as soon as the cyclist hits this  town  he realizes that the old mens advice might not have been so great. the dry desert affects the cyclist the most. this hot climate makes the cyclist extremely thirst, hot, and and sweaty.  wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that i could drop from a heatstroke...  the cyclist's tune here is sarcastic but he is still concerned about his health because of the heat and lack of water. the fact that there is nothing living around the cyclist also affects him. since he s talked to the old men for directions he hasn t seen a glimpse of life, or buildings or anything. so this definetly discourages the cyclist and makes him lose his will to continue his journey. in conclusion, the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways.

1.0 the features of the setting greatly affected the cyclist. for one, he was biking through the high deserts of california in june. this caused the cyclist to become overheated ad sweaty. so he drank from his water bottles frequently. unfortunately, since there was,  no one insight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind,  he had nowhere to fill his bottles and become dehydrated. to make matters worse, the terrain changed from flat road to  short, rolling hills . normally, this would not cause too much struggle, but since he was dehydrated and overheated, each hill seemed  crippling , my thoughts are that if the setting had been a bit cooler and perhaps on the time period the old men had lived in, the cyclist would have had a much more enjoyable experience.
0.333333333333 the features of the setting affect the cyclist by dehydrating him. the cyclist said,  i toiled on. at some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake.  the cyclist was in the desert and each mile he rode he became more and more dehydrated.  the desert sun drying out his body. he said with each passing landmark,  i eased past trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.   @caps that the more he went on the more the desert affected him and dehydrated him.

1.0 the author made the setting seem long and unbearable, felt of undesirable heat and lack of water at hand. specially in the way he kept describing the road with all these challenges that kept appearing like after @num miles to a town then @num miles passed that he,  came to a park of ???. one ramshackly shed, several rusty pumps and  a carrol that couldn t hold in the hamest mule greeted me.this sight was troubling.  then he went in a discharge,  i was traveling strenght the high deserts of california in june. @caps ?? imagine, the heat, and unbareabalnes of the ??? journey still i face. @caps that bike seen endless.then with a thrust gaining on him for example,  i was doing a water-deplety @number mph, sanctures life can seen be cruel.  @caps him feel his constrain regrate on the journey @caps me feel his constrain sorrow for his endless journey he had to go through. another example is,  i riped the sweat from my eyes to make sure i wasn't a mirage . then, reaching this, the building abondoned years ago. @caps his journey seen hopeless and long had that make endless with first wave problems getting strength at him @caps his journey seen to be harder and filled with ?? hope as strenght left to finish his goals.
0.666666666667 the cyclist chose to ride through the worst terrain one can ride through. the cyclist rode through deserts and deserted towns. thats when he started to get thirsty. at first he wasn t tired or thirsty because he was riding by cool trees and rushing water in the morning. once he got to the desert part with no water source then he got thirsty and started to drink his water which depleted fast. the lack of a dry place can make you thirsty by itself but after riding a while it became bad. the setting had everything, to do on how the cyclist had no water and thought he was going to die from heatstroke. that s how the setting affected the cyclist.
1.0 the features of the setting make the cyclist feel hopeless after realizing he is not on a short cut. the cyclist has the  growing realization that  he  could drop from heatstroke  as he rides along. also, the only building he sees for miles  had been @num welch's grape juice factory.  the cyclist is driven deeper into despair and feels that all hope is lost when he sees this building. as he rides on, the song  '@organization' rattled aroung in the dry honeycombs of (his) deteriorating brain.  at this point, the cyclist believes his own death to be inevitable. he saysown death to be inevitable. he says  with any luck i d hit a bump and lodge one in my throat  when talking about pebbles he placed in his mouth. finally, the cyclist reaches a small bait shop, and all hope is returned as he  drank deeply from the sink.  the desert setting, with its lack of water, shelter, and people was the cause of this mans concern and later panic about his own life. the hopelessness of this cyclist is much like the hopelessness of those in the @organization, who trapped in a blizzard far from civilization, resorted to eating their dead just to survive. while the @person @organization went to extremes for their survival, their setting caused them to feel the same hopelessness as the cyclist.

1.0 the features of the setting affect the cyclist because he thinks after a nice afternoon in a nice campground a shortcut to his next destination would be very nice. he thinks the shortcut will be a nice way to relax than to take the original longer way to yosemite. but the trip he makes changes his mind a lot. in the essay the narrator is talking about what the old guys had told him. he says,  the old guys had sworn the next town only eighteen miles down the road. i could make that. i would conserve my water   he did conserve his water but the town was very old and didn t have any water for him to drink. so throughout the essay the narrator went without water until he got to a factory, got some water to drink, and got new directions. the trip was very different from what he had expected. it was more depressing.

1.0 the setting effected the performence of the cyclist and the mood of the cyclist. the rolling hills the cyclist had to get over most likely made him more fined and thirsty because he had to put more effort in to get over them.  over one long, crippiling hill, a building came into view.  the long, big hills that he had to go up and made him more thirsty, but probably more satisfied when it was all over. ironically, the building was a grape juice factory; abandoned and rusty, but the sigh featuring a boy drinking a refreshing glass of juice was still noticeable. this brought his hopes down. but continued to move on. in my life, i have never had such an experience to where i had to keep pushing and urging myself to my goal, but the closes i got, the more distractions got in the way to and stop me.

0.0 the author includes this  because he s using metaphors to explain how the author felt about saeng s personal life is
0.666666666667 the author has a good reason in which she concludes the story with this. the main character of the story, saeng, moves to the united states from vietnam and fails her drivers test. saeng has not adapted to the life in the united states and when she sees a firmilar hibiscus plant she buys if for her memory s of vietnam. the author is trying to show that since saeng planted the hibiscus during winter, when it blooms in spring she will be ready to try to pass her drivers test because she will have adapted the life in the united states. the theme of the story would be if you are moving away from somewhere you grew up in, bring things that remind you of that place so you still have a little of that culture with you. therefore the author begins and ends with the same subject.
0.666666666667 the author concludes the story with this paragraph i think because since the girl failed her test the bud reminds her of her grandmothers long grey hair and i guess that gives her good luck so when the winter passes by and the spring time hits thats buds start to come back out and thats when she will take her test again. thats why the author made this statement the last sentence of the story.
0.333333333333 the author concludes in the story that saeng failed a winter test and because of her love of the hibiscus plant spring will help her take test.
0.666666666667 the author uses this paragraph to conclude to show she s going to give the test another try as well as her new surroundings. for example the story says  almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon, almost fimiliar to her now . saying that she is getting used to where she is now and wants and is willing to give it a chance. almost as if she doesn t find it that bad as she thought at first it being different and not her home and where she was used to being.  
0.333333333333 maybe the author wrote that as the last sentence or paragraph because in the story she did something and failed at it, so she wants to do it again.
0.333333333333 this final paragraph goes along with one of the main premises of the story. to not quite and keep going in order to understand and be happy in this world. saeng is taking this  test  to see if shes ready to change and adapt to her new environment. she failed this time. but when all is right and the hibiscus is ready she will try again to see if shes ready to let go of the old and be happy with the new.
0.333333333333 i believe the author ended the story with the  test  because it is a big part of saeng s life or part of her tradition.
0.666666666667 the importance as to why the author ended this story like this was to show readers the importance of the plant. it seems that because the author is not in her native country that she doesn t have a lot around in this new place that can comfort her. the author being able to find a hibiscus in a place she thought she wouldn t be able to gives her strength to do anything that she can. it is possible that whatever the challenge @month be that the author is trying to get by the fact that she has some support from the plant gives her the achievement and confidence to complete her task
0.333333333333 the author concludes the story with this paragraph because of her sadness  for what she did. the test she was telling about was how she was supposed to use the twenty dollars they had and buying one. big @caps  that she spent most of money besides after to buy a plant which reminded her at home and this last paragraph is saying that when she has the chance to do the  test  again, that she will do what she is supposed to do 
0.666666666667 after reading  winter hibiscus  by minfong ho. i believe ho ended the story with that paragraph to support her idea of overcoming  obstacles. first after failing her driving test, saeng was very upset and didn t know if she would ever pass it. but after seeing a hibiscus plant, it reminded her of her home in vietnam which inspired her. second, when she bought the plant, her mother was a little angry because it was expensive. but, after seeing how the plant brought joy to saeng, her mother forgave her. last when saeng was digging a hole to let the hibiscus grow, it inspired saeng to take the test again because she overcame the obstacles of brining the plant home and letting it grow. therefore, i believe ho end  winter hibiscus , to go along with her idea of overcoming obstacles.
0.666666666667 the author chooses to end the story in a very deep, connected way. itis ended on a note of rebirth and second chances. when saeng vows,  when the come back, inthe spring, when the snow melts and the geese return, when the hibiscus is blooming, i will take the test again,  the author is connecting a sense of a new country and second chances and rebirth. spring and snow melting could be connected to rebirth, while the geese returning could symbolize a second chance. this is connected to saengs second chance.the author also shows that saeng is getting used to the new country, which shows a sense of hope. itshows that thereis some hope for her test.

1.0 the author of  winter hibiscus  concludes the story with this paragraph to depict a development in the character of saeng. at the beginning of the story, saeng is dejected about failing her driver s test. however, this ending paragraph portrays the change that saeng undergoes. in the text, saeng proves to not adapt well to the change from vietnam to @location. she finds solace in a native flower of vietnam, a winter hibiscus. by ending the winter hibiscus in the concluding paragraph (  and this hibiscus is budding  ), the author depicts saeng s change of attitude and her acceptance toward @location. saeng now feels that, like the hibiscus returning after winter is over, she will be able to return and pass the driver s test. also, the concluding paragraph depicts saeng s new adaptation towards the creatures of @location. prior to her imagination to the @location, saeng had no exposure to canada geese. in the concluding statement, saeng s mentioning of the creatures displays her adaptation to @location (  when the snow melts and the geese return  ). this shows saeng s development and adaptation to her new surroundings. at first, saeng proved to have a hard time leaving her native vietnam behind and embracing @caps culture. however, this concluding paragraph summarizes the noticeable change that saeng goes through. in this way, the author includes this paragraph to note the development in character that saeng undergoes.
0.666666666667 coming back from failing her driving test, saeng is comforted by finding the hibiscus flower. it brings back cherished @caps about saeng's homeland, because it is very similar to flowers that grew by her old home. the author concluded the story by saying  when they come back, saeng vowed silently to herself, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then i will take that test again,  to compare saeng to the hibiscus. like saeng, the hibiscus must try to adapt to new surroundings. the author shows that saeng recognizes this connection and is inspired by it. in saeng's mind , if the hibiscus can survive being moved, then so can she.
1.0 the story of  winter hibiscus  is a prolonged metaphor for both connections to a comforting past as well as expectance and the future. saeng misses her homeland but she must learn to adapt to her circumstances, and pass her drivers test. the story is nicely concluded with saeng's promise to herself that come spring, she will take the test again. the hibiscus flower itself generates this promise as it gives her some closure and alleinates some home-sickness. saeng s promise indicates that she is comng to terms with her situation. when she sees the canada geese flying, she has somewhat of an epiphany about the seasons.  almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things she had thought of as strange before had become.. - almost familiar to her now.  i feel that was a landmark for saeng and the conclusion illustrates that by allows to change.
0.666666666667 since it is getting close to winter the geese are going south. the plants are losing there leaves. saeng says that she will take the test again. it seems that when the geese return and the hibiscus buds it will give her hope and confidence. especially the hibiscus because it reminds her of her homeland and her grandmother, when she first saw it and held the leaf it brought a tear to her eye. and when it comes back next year it will rejuvinate her.
0.666666666667 i think the author ends this as the concluding sentence because it symbolize s how the girl presecive things. the girl means when the geese return and the hibiscus is budding it means that it is going to be warm again, @caps means when it is warm again it brings her spirit up because it reminds her of her homeland. i think by her being remind of her homeland would help her take the test easier because she will be more happy. @caps i think will help her do better on the test. for example, the author said in the story that the flower bring her comfort @caps i think being comfortable is the best way to succeed and pass the test. in conclusion i think the author ends the story like that because he wanted the readers to understand a connection with the girl and her homeland, and how flower comfort her.
0.666666666667 she ends it with that statement to show that she is ready to relive spring in the new country now that she is comforted by the hibiscus. the test is adapting to the new country and she failed it she believes because she had to be comforted by her native plants, but she believes that she will pass the test next year because every repetition of the season allow her to become  more adapted to the new culture. when she says   when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding then i will take that test again.  all those things tell her it s a new year and makes it easier to accept what s happening.

0.75 the obstacles the builders face were great. they explained how most dirigibles from outside the @location use a different gas called hydrogen which is highly flammable. following that they told @location how hindenburg by fire in @number which used hydrogen. they realized if this had happen in a urban area it could have been worse. anthore obstacle they faced was the wind. if the dirigible was parked at mooring mast the violent wind speeds would make the blimp shift and cause strees on the building steel frame. the greatest obstacle was the law passed. the law stated that no airships could fly to low in urban areas. this would keep blimps from landing there.
0.5 the obstacles the builders of the empire state building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there are stress to the building's frame. the stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. the steel frame of the empire state building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation. over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework.
0.75 the builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. the steel frame of the building needed to be modified and strengthened to make a place for dirigibles to dock. also, over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made. the last obstacle builders had was that a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building would add stress to the buildings frame. it was not easy for builders to build a mooring mast on top of the highest building that was one thousand two hundred fifty feet, but the architects reached their point by designing the mooring mast.
0.5 the builder's of the empire state building faced many difficult obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. the greatest obstacle of the use of a mooring mast was the wind. at the top of the empire state building the winds were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. the winds would cause the back of the dirigible to swivel around the mooring mast. another reason the dirigibles would not be able to more at the empire state building is because there is a law that says airships cannot fly low in urban areas. this would make it illegal for the dirigible to approach or dock at the empire state building.
0.75 in the excerpt from,  the mooring mast , by marcia amidon l sted, tells about the original purpose to the mast on top of the empire state building was to serve as a landing spot for dirigibles (blimps).some obstacles the builders of the empire state building faced was the tremendous stress that the mast would put on the empire state building. in order to get around this, they put frame work around the entire building's frame. another obstacle that was faced was safety. first of all, the wind at the top of the empire state building was to great for any blimp to stay aloft in mid-air without being tossed around. finally, the possibility of the blimp either popping on the spikes, or blowing up because of the hydrogen, over new york city.in conclusion, the mast on the empire state building, looked good on paper, but once you add in natural elements, the mast had too many flaw to it.
0.25 the greatest abstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. there were high violent air currents causing the building to constantly shift. it was neither practical nor safe.
0.75 in the article  the mooring mast  by marcia amidon l sted, many obstacles of building the empire state building as a docking station for dirigibles are describle. john tauranac, the man who came up with the plan to dock dirigibles on the top of the empire state building forgot some very important things to take into account. first the entire building would have to be modified because  a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stres to the building's frame  (paragraph @num). the second problem that would need to be solved would be the safety of the city. many  dirigibles from outside united states used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable.  (paragraph @num.). if an accident like german dirigible hindenburg happened, it would be ten times worse. lastly, the  violent air currents  (paragraph @num) would pose as one of the greatest obstacles. the u.s. navy dirigible los angeles tried to tie up but could not get close enough because of  forceful wind.  (paragraph @num). the obstacles of making the empire state building into a mooring mast caused too many obstacles that could not be solved.
0.5 in order to allow dirigibles to dock on the roof of the empire state building, the workers would have to go through a series of tasks such as, strengthening the steel frame, and designing a sturdy mast. if the frame were not strong enough, then the building would simply colapse. more than sixty thousand dollars was spent on restructuring the frame. also with high-speed winds the mast would have be incredibly sturdy, otherwise the dirigible would not stay in one place. after the hindenburg disaster, people realized how unsafe these dirigibles really were, and so the idea would was found not only unsafe but it illegal. in conclusion, not a single blimp would ever be docked, nor will one ever.
0.5 most of the obsticles the builders of the empire state building had were due to weather. if new york ever had a windy day the dirigible would pull at the mast. the mast is attached to the  @caps  of the building, and it might affect the frames or  @caps  of the building. another reason is the danger it would bring to all of new york. if a dirigible ever hit something or something went wrong the dirigible would @caps on top of new york. with all the trafic of new york you would most likly not want a burning dirigible falling overhead.
0.25 obstacles that the builders of the empire state building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were some of the following. they needed an exact way of getting everything perfect for the job. the whole building process for this job was very complicating and needed the best expertese.in paragraph @num, al smith's quote greatly backs up to my point. he says  one set of engineers here in new york is trying to dope out a practical, workable arrangement and the government people in washington are figuring on some safe way of mooring airships to the mast . it tells just how much people are working on this job.in conclusion, this was a complicated job. they weren't positive if the mast even be able to stay. they also werent positive if the fluids inside would be but a problem factor.
0.75 in the novel, the mooring mast, by marcia amidon l sted, obsticals of the empire state building faced to attempemt to allow dirigibles to dock there were enginering challenges. a problem with the docking was that the building was complete before the idea came to mind. a second problem was that the whole skeletal structure had to be changed in order for dirigibles to be able to dock. then the question on how the airships, dirigibles, would stay next to the building. these were harder problem after it was illigale to have dirigibles to be close to buildings as well. plus the fact that if they crash they are flamable and could kill people. those are some facts that made it difficult for the empire state building to build a dirigibles docks in the novel, the mooring mast, by marcia amidon l sted.
0.75 in the excerpt, the mooring mast, by marcia amidon l sted, had many obstacles of the construction of the empire state building in allowing dirigibles to dock there. the author states  the other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the empire state building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas.  that law was considered illegal for a ship to approach the area and to get tied up to the building. another obstacle was the lack of landing area, it was a challenge to expand in new york city, causing it hard to land dirigibles. the greatest obstacle was nature itself, the weather would cause the dirigibles to swivel around the mooring mast. the author states,  dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weights... dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe. 
0.0 the builders of the empire state building had to face the obstacle of safety, to make sure everyone can get on the dirigible safely without any form of danger. another obstacle is arranging the dirigibles so that they are able to board passengers from there. @person said  the height made it desirable to postpone to a later date the final installation of the landing gears.  people did'nt want to try it, so that would be another obstacle. if people did'nt want to try it then it will become just a decoration, and that's not what al smith wanted. last obstacle would be that it would'nt hold for long as said in the excerpt  the mooring mast on the empire state building was destined to never fulfill its purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed.  in other words, the architects did'nt think to far a head into the future to see if the mooring mast would even be used. these are some of the obstacles that the builders had to face.
0.25 when the empire state building was built the workers were trying to find new ways to @caps the structure. they had sudently had found some problems with one being the top of the empire state building.      workers had tryed to figure out hwo they were going to but a dirigibles on top of the building so that they could be able to pick up people and to drop them off up there but there were different problems.
0.75 i've been to the empire state building before, right up to the top. the top was not opened, but several windows were, and our thing that still stays with me is how amazingly windy it is up there. trying to park a blimp on top of the building would be like trying to park a car in a flood, impossible i was waiting for that factor to come up the whole story, and it finally did.  the winds on top of the building work constantly shifting due to violent air currents  (@caps @num) in addition to parking the blimp, the passengers would have to get off on a swaying gang-plank, which would not be too fun. another problem they faced was the law. there was  an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas.  (@caps @num) i would think that before spending @money on an already unrealistic project, they would at least have made sure they were cleared law-wise. when i read this essay, it seems the project was doomed from the start.
0.75 there were many obstacles that the builders of the empire state building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there the higher calling for which the mooring mast was built was to put new york on the forefront of modern travel; the builders then, needed to solve some obstacles that were on their way. first was that the building itself needed to get stronger in order to support  a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building  as a result, the frame of the empire state building needed to be modified and strengthened to accommodate the problem. according to the excerpt, @money worth of changes had to be made to the building's framework. another problem was that of the stress of the wind pressure the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation. this was also solved, at least they thought, by making a few changes to the skeleton of the building. lastly, was that the building needed a space to provide for passengers that were to come from the  blimps . to solve the problem, they built a shaft to bring passengers down to the @num floor, where baggage and ticket areas would be located. the builders had to face many problems even before attempting to build a mast for dirigibles to dock at.
0.5 the obstacles the builders of the empire state building faced law against airships flying to low over urban areas this law made it illegal for ship to ever tie up to the building, fearing that the wind would blow the dirigible onto the sharp spires of other buildings in that area. that would harm the dirigible's shall then another dirigible attempted a publicity stunt, when it would tie up and deliver a bundle of newspaper to the empire state building. the idea of the mooring was shelved. they yet unsolved problems of mooring air ships to a fixed mast at such a height made it desirable. the highest open observatory dock, intended for disembarking passengers, has never been open to the public.
0.75 in the excerpt  the mooring mast  by marcia amidon l sted there were many obstacles that the workers had to face to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the empire state building. one of the many obstacles the workers faced was that they could not simply drop a mooring mast on the top of the empire state building. also the thousand-foot dirigibles moored at the top of the empire state building. a single cable tether held the dirigible and it would add stress to the building's frame. the biggest obstacle the workers would face was the mooring mast on top of the building with all winds shifting due to vilent air currents. another obstacle was the dirigibles were moored in open field and they were weighted down in the back. the problem was they were dangling high above pedestrians on the street. those are the obstacles the workers faced
0.25 the original plan for the empire state building was to be tallest building in the world, at @num feet. everything was going well until the competition. the chrysler building, threatened to steal the title. when al smith announced that he was going to but a mooring mast at the top of the empire state building, this obviously changed the architects designs.  the architects desighned a shiny glass & chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from the inside, with a stepped-back desighn that imitated the overall shape of the building. the rocket-shaped mast would have four wings at its corners... and would rise to a conical roof that would house the mooring arm.  (l sted). two months after the workers started with the new plan, the celebrated because the finished framing the entire building  the empire state building was destined to never fulfill its purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed. the greatest reason was safety.  (l sted)
0.75 allowing dirigibles was going to be the new way of transportation back in the @number there were many problems with having a mooring dock on top of the empire state building.one of the main problems was it was flamable. the helium and the hydrogen gases that lifted the dirigibles. if there was the smallest spark the entire dirigible would go up in flames in a second. for an example the hindenburg german zeppelin that exploded in new jersey on may @number @number so the thought if that had happened in a more densely populated area like downtown new york it would of been much worse.another problem with the dirigibles was wind. if there was strong air currents the dirigible would swivel around the mooring mast when it was docked. aqlso it is weighed down by the lead by lead weights. if it is over pedestrians it is not safe.
0.5 there are always challenges when you are trying something inovative. there are obstacles like getting approval, gaining support and you also need to be structurally sound. al smith and the rest of these archetects faced all of these. during the @number dirigibles were supposed to be the future of travel. al smith wanted to be able to dock a dirigible on top of the empire state building. other than getting people to go along with the plan he had other problems. the wind is very violent at that altitude. dirigibles were not supposed to fly that close to the city it is dangerous and some were highly flamable. in conclusion there were too many large obstacles to overcome.
0.5 the first obstacle was their expanded use in new york city was the lake of suitable landing area. because some were as long as one thousand feet, the same length as four blocks in new york city.the second was that there dirigibles had hydrogen in it and hydrogen was highly flammable. and the realized how much worst accident could have been if it had taken place in new york because this is where they were located. they had to re-think about they're plan. and another one was that the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents.
0.75 there was many obstacles the builders of the empire state building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. one obstacle was that a lot of dirigibles outside the @location use hydrogen over helium. the problem was hydrogen is highly flammable,  when the german dirigible hindenburg was destroyed by fire in lakehurst, new jersey, on may @number @number the owners of the empire state building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densley populated area such as downtown new york city.  @caps can only imagine how tragic and chaotic that would have been. another obstacle the builders faced was nature.  the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting do to violent air currents. that would've meant that these dirigibles could just have got swept back. in conclusion there was several obstacles the builders of the empire state building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.
0.75 in the excerpt from  the mooring mast  by marcia amidon l sted, their were many obstacles the builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. one reason was the safety. paragraph @num from the excerpts explains that,  most dirigibles from outside of the united states used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable.  it shows us that if an accident was to happen on the mast above a densely populated area like downtown new york, then the accident could get ugly. another reason why was nature itself. paragraph @num explains that the,  winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents.  this was another safety issue because the dirigibles would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street. a third obstacle was that there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. as you can see those were some obstacles builders faced.
0.75 the obstacles that the builders of the empire state building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were that there wasn't a lot of room for them to land. the length of them was the same as four blocks in new york city. they also needed to consult with experts and take tours of the equipment. they did lots of experiments and tests on dirigibles. it was also dangerous to have them land there. it was also bad for the enviroment because hydrogen is used and it's is highly flammable. dirigibles can't dock there because it wasn't stable and that makes it not safe for people.
0.5 some of the things they faced were safety hazards. like when they said in @caps @num when the hindenburg was destroyed they said  the owners of the empire state building realized how much worse that accident could of been if it was over new york.  another obstacle they faced as they said in @caps @num was  nature itself.  the winds would make a airship @caps around like crazy. the last problem was the law stating airships can @caps that low above urban cities.
1.0 the builders of the @organization many obstacles in order to allow dirigibles to dock there. to start off, there was a lack of suitable landing area. this was a tough obstacle because the builders needed to think of a place that extremely large dirigibles could land while in a crowded place like new york city. next, was figuring out a safe way of getting the mooring mast on top of the empire state building. this was another tough obstacle because if the mast was just placed on the top of the building, it would add stress to the building's frame, which is dangerous. lastly, and most importantly, was the problem of nature. at the top of the building there were constantly shifting wings due to violent air currents. this was an extremely dangerous obstacle because the winds could cause the dirigibles to be constantly moving and shaking. also, if they were weighted down by lead weights to prevent them from being affected by the wind, the weights would be dangling above pedestrians on the street. to allow dirigibles to dock on the empire state building, the builders @organization many different obstacles.
0.75 based on the excerpt, the obstacles that the builders of the empire state building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there would be that the architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the empire state building's flat roof because a thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame. the stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications on the framewor the greatest obstace of the mooring mast was nature itself. the winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air current. the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast.
0.5 al smith was a guy who had an idea of making the world tallest building, and he didn't give up. in december @number @number he announced that the empire state building, goal height would reach @number feet. he also wanted transportation to involve.the obstacles the builders of the empire state building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, was the lack of landing area. al smith thought he could add a mooring mast to the top of the building and allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service, and let passengers on and off.one of the greatest obstacle to let the dirigibles docked there, was the weather. the dirigibles moored in open landing fields could weigh down, where it could dangle high above pedestrians on the street. it was also an existing. law against airships, flying too low over urban areas.
0.5 through life many people plan to make or build an amazing object but have to acomplish amazing feats in order to do this. in the excerpt  the mooring mast  by marcia amidon l sted, @organization plans on building the tallest building in the world, but in order to do this he has to defeat many obstacles that you and i may never even think of. on december @number @number the empire state building was announced the world's tallest building. in making this huge building there were many obstacles. one of the obstacles was allowing dirigibles to dock on the building.  the greatest obstacle was nature itself. the winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents.  this quote shows that it may be unsafe to allow dirigibles to dock due to the winds. another quote that shows an obstacle of having dirigibles docking at the empire state building is,  an existing law against airships flying to low over urban areas . this quote shows that it might be illegal to allow dirigibles to dock on the empire state building. in life we defeat great obstacles but sometimes we cannot defeat the obstacles we face.
0.5 the dirigibles were not able to dock on the mast of the empire state building for obvious reasons. when the construction workers were building the mast, they didn't realize how dangerous it was having a dirigible landing on the top of the building. there were a few cautions that the workers realized. first off, if the dirigible catches on fire like the one in lakehurst, new jersey, then a lot of people would be at risk because it is such a big city with massive amounts of people. another reason they realized after was that it was too dangerous for the dirigible to land there due to the high swirling winds. if they tried landing there, but the violent winds wouldn't let them, then it would not be the least bit safe. this is how the workers of the empire state building faced obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock there.
0.25 the obstacles the builders of the empire state @caps face. was that their expanded use in @location was the lack of a suitable landing erea. al smith saw an opportunity for his empire state building.a mooring mast added to the top of the building would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service, and to let passangers off and on. dirigibles were docked by means of an electric winch, which hauled in a line from the front of the ship and then tied it to a mast.
1.0 in the process of building the dock for dirigibles, builders faced some obstacles. the first obstacle builders faced, was the lack of suitable landing area. if there wasn't area to land, there was no reason or way to build it. also, the builders would have to remodel the whole building. after the building was framed to the @number floor, they couldn't build the mast until the roof was done, so it took even longer.the greatest obstacle the mast dealt with was nature itself, because the winds on the tops of the buildings were constantly shifting, so there was no way for a dirigible to land or stay in place without crashing. the final obstacle builders faced was a law against airships flying too low to the urban areas, which made it illegal for a ship to ever tie up or even approach the building.as you can see, there were many obstacles, and the mast wasn't useful. it was a great idea. but in my opinion it was a waste of time and money.
0.5 the obstacles of getting the dirigibles to be able to dock at the empire state building was, they couldn't put the fuell on top of the building. putting mooring mast on top of the roof would make it very unstable and putt a lot of pressure on it. for this to happen they had to modify the structure of the roof, which ended up costing over @money. after succefully building that they had another obstacle. it was trying to figure out how the dirigibles wouldn't move around with so much wind currents. they never figured out how and the idea just disappeared.
0.75 during the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock at the empire state building, builders faced many obstacles. one obstacle builders faced was the building's @caps.  a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the  empire state building  held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame.  another obstacle in the way was nature itself. the reason was that the winds on top of the empire state building was always changing because of violent air currents. this was dangerous because  even if the dirigible were tethered to the mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast.  @caps, there is a law in the united states against airships flying too low over urban areas.  this would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the  empire state building  or even approach the area. many more obstacles were faced during the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock at the empire state @caps, but that didn't stop the workers from doing their job.
0.75 the builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. for example the building had to be reframed because its original frame could not support the weight of a dirigible on top it. also the materials inside dirigibles are highly flammable so an accident above an urban area thats highly popuated would have been costly/fatal. another obstacle was the wind, since the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents the dirigible would be swiveling around and unstable, thus making the idea for docking dirigibles on top of the empire state building unpractical and unsafe.
0.75 in the mooring mast by marcia amidon l sted, it describes many ways the obstacles the builders of the empire state building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. it was hard enough for the builders to build the empire state building but on top of that they must make a mooring mast at the top. four term governor of new york al smith said it best,  one set of engineers here in new york is trying to dope out a practical, workable arrangement and the government people in washington are figuring out some safe way of mooring airships to this mast.  another obstacle builders faced was having a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, only held by a single cable tether, was simply not safe. with this being said, the steel frame of the empire state building would have to be modified and strengthened, costing over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications. no matter how the builders built the empire state building they still face nature as an obstacle. these are examples builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.
0.25 obstacles the builders had to try and over come were the extra preshure on the frame of the @caps and the diffuclt docking process also the high speed winds that made it basicly impossible to do.
0.25 some of the troubles builders came into play with while constructing the empire state buildings mooring mast, were structure, how it would be built, and how it could physically hold a blimp without being ripped out. one problem was figuring out how to reinforce the mast so that the lead could transfer to the foundation instead of ripping off the top half of the building.
0.75 many things went wrong while trying to allow dirigibles to dock ontop of the empire state building. first, allowing this dirigible to dock on top of the empire state building  would add stress to the buildings frame . -@caps @num. these dirigibles are highly flamable and over a very populated place like new york city could be very dangerous. the winds at the top of the building were  constantly shifting due to violent air currents. even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast. -@caps @num. if lead weights were used they could fall from dirigible and kill civilians. the biggest obstacle was that a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. this seemed to be a good idea on paper but when actually attempted it was too unrealistic.
1.0 the plan to allow dirigibles to dock on the empire state building encountered problems from its introduction until its conclusion. the first problem was the original design of the building. the original design did not include a dirigible docking station. when plans for the station were introduced, the building was not strong enough to carry the heavy load of a spire and a dirigible. to adjust, an additional @money were spent in order to ensure the building would be structurally sound during a dirigible docking. the next problem became imminent after the hindenburg's fire: any hydrogen-filled dirigible that caught fire at the empire state building which cause significant damage. moreover, because many dirigibles used hydrogen, the safety risk was significant. wind proved to be another obstacle. the force of a dirigible being blown around by heavy winds could prove to be too much for the structure of the building. moreover, because any dirigible docking at the building would be one thousand feet off the ground, there was no way to anchor the dirigibles. the fact that many tall spires lined the @location skyline presented an imminent danger to any dirigible trying to dock. finally, one of the most significant problems of building a dirigible docking station was the fact that law prohibited low flying aircraft in urban areas.
0.25 in the building of @organization gets very competitive. he wants to construct the biggest building in new york city. when the construction was going on he wanted to add a top or hat so that the mast would be able to drop off people directly into the building. but then there was a problem they had to consult it to allow it. irving then let al know that the building wasn't going to be done on time, because of the mast. that's what the empire state building faced during its contraction.
1.0 the builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles in their efforts to make it possible for dirigibles to dock on the mast. one problem was safety. some dirigibles were filled with hydrogen, which is, according to the article,  highly flammable.  @caps a dirigible catch fire right over a very populated area would be dangerous. nature was another factor.  violent air currents  made it difficult to maneuver a dirigible and bring it close enough to the mast to dock. yet even if these frustrating conditions were not extant, it would still have been impossible for a dirigible to moor on the mast, because it was illegal. a law prohibited  airships  from  flying too low over urban areas,  which included dirigibles. these obstacles were overlooked in the plans to create the empire state building.
1.0 in the article  the mooring mast,  marcia amidon @caps describes how safety, laws, and nature are the three main obstacles builders of the empire state building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. safety was the greatest reason that dirigibles could not be docked in @organization. the biggest safety hazard was that many countries outside of the @location use hydrogen in their dirigibles instead of helium. a german dirigible had recently been destroyed in a fire in new jersey because,  hydrogen is highly flammable  (@caps, @num). the builders of the empire state building realized that the accident would have been far worse if it had occurred,  above a densely populated area such as downtown new york  (@caps @num) and by docking dirigibles there, they run the risk that it could happen. nature was another big obstacle that hindered the success of a mooring mast. violent air currents at the top of the empire state building were always causing winds to change, so because only the front of the dirigibles was tethered to the mooring mast,  the back of the ship would swivel around  (@caps, @num). they could not use lead weights to weigh down the back like they used in open fields because having weights hanging above pedestrians on the street,  was neither practical nor safe  (@caps, @num). nature was a major obstacle because it could not be changed and there was no easy way to fix the issues it caused. the last obstacle was an existing law which prevented airships from,  flying too low over urban areas  (@caps, @num). this law made it illegal for the ship to both approach the area and tie up to the building, which was a huge obstacle that was impossible to get around. the obstacles of safety, laws, and nature that the builders of the empire state building faced made it impossible to dock dirigibles to the moore mast on the building.
1.0 four main obstacles prevented dirigibles from ever docking at the empire state building. the first was that a much more complex mooring mast would have to be installed on top of the empire state building, a very different mast than the regular masts found in open field docking areas. when a dirigible would dock on the mast cause great stress to the building's frame, a problem that could be solved by increasing the strength of the steel frame. another problem was that a dirigible was made of hydrogen and could easily catch fire and explode. engineers saw this would cause large problems over a densly populated area like, new york city. once the mast was built a new problem arised, even if the dirigible could dock the intense winds could make the back end of the dirigible move violently, or cause an airship to be unable to dock, like the inncodent with the los angeles. nor could they use lead weights to weigh down the ballon since they would be a danger to civilians. lastly, a law against airships flying too low over urban areas could have prevented docking. these reasons made it impossible for a ship to ever moor on top of the empire state building, although two ships got very close.
0.75 the obstacles the builder of the empire state building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were a lot. they had trouble with the area thing where they were going to do their job.  the one obstacle in their expanded used in new york city was the lack of a suitable landing area.  another obtacle that they had was with the mooring mast.  the greatest obstacle to the successful of the mooring mast was nature itself. the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast.  then there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. and if they did it it would become illegal to the ship that pass tie up to the building or even approach the area.
0.75 the builders of the empire state building in new york faced many obstacles while attempting to allowed dirigibles to dock. one obstacle of the builders was creating the empire state building with the strength to hold the dirigible, swaying in the wind, without the building falling over. the weight of the dirigible would have to be transferred to the bottom of the building which was almost eleven hundred feet below. the largest obstacle, however, was holding the dirigible in place while it was docked atop the building. the winds were  constantly shifting due to violent air currents  and would make the dirigible fly wildly around the top of the building (@caps paragraph @num). the building would never be used for its transportational all purpose because of the dangers and obstacles of the mooring mast and dirigibles.
0.5 the obstacles the builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock is that a thousand-foot dirigibe moored at the top of the building would add stress to the building's frame. also the stress of the dirigibe's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted. it would need to transmitted to the buildings foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. the steel frame would have to be modified and strengthened this would be over sixty thousand dollars.
0.75 builders trying to allow dirigibles to dock ontop of the empire state building faced problems. the dirigibles waight and the wind pressure would add stress to the building. wich @caps to be transmitted more then @num ft down to the buildings foundation. construction wasn't the only problem. most @caps-american dirigibles are held afloat by hellium wich is extremely flammable and if it was @caps over busy + crowded new york streets many people could have been killed. nature added to the problems. wind currents had the pottential to push dirigibles into @caps buildings, causing them to pop. the finall problem was @caps already implace wich didn''t allow low flying aircrafts. builders faced problems with nature, @caps, safety, and construction wich lead to the demise of the use of the mooring system.
0.5 in the excerpt  the mooring mast  by marcia amidon l sted explains the empire state buildings past construction which led it to be the tallest building in the united states. although the buider al smith had many obstacles, they faced of the hardest one when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. one of the obstacles is allowing dirigibles to anchor their for several hours for refueling or service, and to let passengers off and on. another obstacle is letting dirigibles dock because of they need a place to tie up to a mast. it is stated,  dirigibles were docked by means of an electric winch, which haulled in a line from the front of the ship and then tied it to a mast  (l sted @num) this can be a problem because the body of the mast could swing in alot of breeze. although there were many obstacles al smith worked his way around them and procceded to finish the empire state building with corage to take on all obstacles.
1.0 in the short story,  the mooring mast,  there were obstacles the builders of the empire state building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles dock there. one problem was that the dirigible's load and the wind pressure on the building's foundation.  the stress of the dirigible's load into the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. the steel frame of the empire state building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation.  @caps, this was a big obstacle for the landing process of the dirigibles.another problem they had was that dirigibles use hydrogen, and hydrogen is highly flammable. if it had caught fire, it would not have been good for a populated city.  the mooring mast  of the empire state building was destined never to fulfill it's purpose. most dirigibles from outside of the united states used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable.  if the dirigible caught the building on fire, many people's lives would be in complete danger. in conclusion, the mooring mast did not work out for many reasons, but safety and the dirigible's load and wind pressure on the building's foundation were two big obstacles for allowing dirigibles to dock.
0.5 there were many obstacles the builders of the empire state building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. the thousand foot dirigible on top the empire state building could add stress to the building's frame. the stress from the dirigible was way too much to carry, and the frame of the building would have to have been modified and strengthened to be able to hold the dirigible. there were many risks taken by landing a dirigible atop the empire state building.
0.75 the architects of late @number and @number new york had plans to revolutionize @caps, and put new york at the forefront of modern travel. however there wild ideas fell short to reality. in an attempt to outstrip the chrysler building, architect al smith added an unsecure mast to the top of the empire state building. the place where blimps, or dirigibles, could let on and off passengers and refule, had more hype than study. the biggest obstacle the builders faced was safety. since most blimps outside the united states used hydrogen rather than helium, they were very flammable. if the german blimp  hindenburg  had blown up above a more densely populated area than new jersey, such as new york, the results would have been far more devastating. as paragraph @num states, if the mast were a success, the weather would prove to be fatal. even if the ship were tethered to the mast, it would still swivel around. the u.s. navy tried to tie up next to the mast-before a law was passed not allowing aircraft the fly so low-but the wind may their efforts futile. the architects of the @number and @number were thinking big, but some obstacles were too big to leap.
0.75 when the idea of creating a moring post for dirigibles on top of the empire state building there were several problems engeneers failed to reconize. the first was the problem of using highly flamable hydrogen to fill the dirigibles. the hindenburg accident showed how horible it is one one of these explodes. the situation would have been much worse had it been over @num stories in the air. secondly violent wind gusts would have made it  imposible to dock the dirigible atop the building, especially when the use of custimary lead weights would be both unsafe and not pratical. lastly there was a law imposed before this project was ever a thought making it unlawful to fly any airship that low to an urban area.
1.0 the builders - designers of the empire state building faced many obsticles in allowing dirigibles to dock at the top. the first, and most apparent one was the frame of the building. the article says,  the architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on the top of the @organization flat roof  (@num). the thousand foot tower would add extra strain on the building's frame. next was the question of safety. most international dirigibles were filled with hydrogen, a very dangerous gas, and if set on fire will make a huge explosion, as an example with the german dirigible the hindenburg. if that same accident took place over new york city, many pedestrians would be hurt or killed. also, the wind played a huge obsticle. the winds  were constantly shifting due to violent air currents  (@num) and therefore the back of the ship would  swivel around and around the mooring mast  which would be extremly unsafe. lastly, and most simply, the law didn't allow for an airship to fly that low over urban areas. all of these obsticles put together caused the idea of using the building as a docking tower to fail.
0.75 there were many obstacles which the builders of the empire state building faced in attempting to construct a mast for docking dirigibles. one of the main reasons that the mast was never built was due to safety. most of the foreign dirigibles ran on hydrogen and the builders did not want to risk another hindenburg accident in the highly populated new york city. nature also restricted the building of a dock. the winds on top of the empire state building were constantly changing because of violent air currents, another threat that the builders did not want to risk. finally, there was a law that prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas. there were many reasons why the mast was never constructed including safety issues, nature, and an existing law that prohibited low air travel over the city. in the end however, the building of a dirigible mast was neither practical nor safe, and the project was eventually dropped.
0.75 in the excerpt, the builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. according to the excerpt, the author says  the greatest reason was one of safety . the dirigible used hydrogen that was highly flameable and they could not risk it in such a densely populated area. another obstacle was the wind and nature itself. in the excerpt it said  the winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting do to violent air currents  this created another safety problem. the wind would sway the dirigible back and forth, and if they used weights to weigh the back down, it would be dangerous hanging above pedestrians. the author explained how  the mooring mast of the empire state building was destined to never fulfill its purpose.  this being because it was just not practical nor safe.
0.5 the excerpt  the mooring mast  by @organization is a story that takes the reader through the obstacles and attempts builders faced when trying to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the empire state building. al smith, four-term governor of new york, planned to construct the empire state building after he was in office.smith was competitive and realized that the building was close to earning the title of world's tallest building. so in @number he announced that the building would be @number feet and he would do this by adding a top or hat to the building which would be distinctive. the idea was to add a mooring mass and observation decks to the top and have it be able to dock dirigibles, or blimps. architects later realized that a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by one cable tether would add stress to the building's frame. the stress of a dirigible's load with the pressure of wind would go all the way to the building's foundation. the plans that have builders working so hard on frame work and observation decks failed. it was not practical to dock a dirigible, it wouldn't be safe. by the late @number the idea was given up on, but the empire state building is still open to one of the observation decks and is a very popular attraction in new york.
0.5 based on the article the mooring mast, the builders of the empire state building faced challenges in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, such as the lack of landing area, being practical, and ensuring safety. the lack of landing area was of the the challenges.  the one obstacle to their expanded use in new york city was the lack of a suitable landing area . since no dirigible could land on the empire state building without some fish and landing space this was a challenge the builders of the building faced. another challenge was making the dock practical,  one set of engineers here in new york is trying to dope out a practical, workable arrangement.. . this shows that a practical arrangement of the talking has yet been made, and therefore it was another challenge the builders faced. lastly, the builders of the empire state building faced safety issues,  .... are figuring on some safe way of mooring airships to this mast -this informs that the safety of docking dirigibles has not been unsured yet, that it was still a challenge the builders faced area altogether, the builders of the empire state building faced challenges such as the lack of landing areas, being practical, and ensuring safety.
1.0 the obstacles that builders of the empire state building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock had some consequences. one of the obstacles to there expanded use in new york city was the lack of a suitable landing area. also, the architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the empire state buildings flat roof because a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame. the greatest obstacle to successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. the winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. the last obstacle why dirigibles could not moor at the empire state building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. the u.s. navy dirigible los angeles approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds
0.75 in the excerpt from  the mooring mast , by marcia amidon l sted, the author describes many challenges the architects faced while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. the architects had new challenges that would almost seem impossible to prevent at times. the height of the building, the weight of the dirigible against the building, and the fact that dirigibles are highly flammable, adds to the many obstacles the architects were faced with. the height of the building was a major problem for the architects. it was very difficult for pilots to safely maneuver around buildings, especially in a city with many buildings. the unpredictable winds meant the dirigibles could be blown into a building at any point. there was even a law against it that  would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area  (para @num). another problem the architects encountered was the high flammability of the dirigibles. the dirigibles made in most other countries were made with hydrogen rather than helium. after another dirigible caught on fire people realized how much worse  that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown new york  (para @num). the biggest problem of all was the weight of the dirigibles on the massive height of the building. the architects saw that,  the stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings' foundation  (para @num). they knew this was very unsafe for the passangers unloading and for the people in the building. overall, the problems and challenges the architects faced were too strong for them to overcome.
0.75 the builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. one issue was the violent air currents that were at the top of the building. even if the dirigibles successfully docked at the top of the building the back end of it would be thrashing around from the wind. if this happened and the blimp became uncontrollable it could crash into another building and fall to the ground where all the downtown new @caps walk. putting weights on the end of the blimp would help that situation but as @caps says,  dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weights, but using these at the empire state building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe.  another issue the builders faced was the fact that dirigibles were highly flammable. they learned their lesson and got it into their heads that their idea might not be so good after when the german blimp, the hindenburg, was destroyed. 
0.5 the builders of the empire state building faced multiple obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. if they were to succeed, they would have become a major aviation accommidation for transatlantic routes and new routes that were yet to come. in order to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the building, the mooring mast needed to be constructed and put on to the top of the building. simply adding the masts to the building was no easily reached task. the empire state building's frame needed to be modified so it could withstand the stress from the dirigible mounted onto the mooring mast. over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications were made to adjust the building's framework. once the framework was adjusted, architects designed a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that was illuminated from the inside. this tower served as a mast for the building to come. before the mooring mast could be constructed, the roof of the building had to be completed. once the roof was constructed, the mooring mast was added with its own skeleton of steel. once the entire project was finished, the owners of the empire state building realized that docking dirigibles would be much too dangerous. after all the rigorous work put into the mooring mast was completed, it became clear that it would never be used for its original purpose.
1.0 the builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. the first obstacle they had to overcome was that if a dirigibles, which could reach up to a thousand feet in length, was moored to the tops of the building it would add stress to the building's frame. this meant the steel frame of the building had to be strengthened and modified to deal with the added stress. the cost of the modifications was over sixty thousand dollars. the next challenge was discovered after the building was finished. this was the fact that having dirigibles moor at the empire state building was unsafe. this first reason why it is unsafe is that most dirigibles, not from the united states, used hydrogen into helium and hydrogen is highly flammable. this meant an accident like that of the hindenburg could happen above the highly populated downtown area of new york. another problem that arose after the construction was that the shifting winds on top of the building were too violent for the dirigible, which would swivel around the mooring mast. all these challenges along with an existing law they did not allow airships to fly too low over urban areas were the obstacles faced by the builders of the empire state building and is why only one dirigible was ever moored there.
1.0 based on the excerpt, the builders of the empire state building faced many obsticles and attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. one obsticle was the fact that dirigibles were dangerous when not handled correctly. if so, many people could die because it was within a densely populated area. in paragraph @num, the author states,  most dirigibles from outside of the united states used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable.  @caps was also an issue in allowing dirigibles to dock there; the wind at that height was very forcefull, and would become a problem. in paragraph @num, the author states in relation to the wind,  even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast.  another obsticle was the laws against airships flying too low over urban areas. paragraph @num states,  this law would make it illegal for a ship to tie up to the building or even a produced area...  @caps, all of these obsticles made it impossible in the end for dirigibles to dock at the empire state building.
0.75 the builders of the mooring mast plan the construction well, but did not consider the potential risks of the mast. one reason that the mast's fate was sealed was because of safety issues. most dirigibles, or blimps, used hydrogen rather than helium. if one of these blimps were to fall from the sky, many people below would be killed. new york has many people that walk everywhere. the builders also needed to considered the violent winds at such a high altitude. these winds could blow the dirigibles around, making it difficult to keep them in one spot for passengers to board, and to refuel. the winds are constantly shifting. they could blow the blimps onto the spires on the empire state building, causing them to burst and fall to the ground below. unfortunately, there is a law that prevents airships from flying too low over urban areas.  this would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area . i think that al smith was more focused on keeping his height record, more than the potential dangers of the mast.
0.75 in the story construction workers faced a problem. the idea of having a dirigible's dock ontop of the empire state building was comming to an end. when thinking about the idea the architecture never put thought in legal persasures as in air crafts cant fly low on urban areas. also the heavy wind that picks up from the building making the air craft hard to controll. another was the dangers they could inflict to civilians. if not @caps right the air craft can get loose and dingle down to urban areas or like the german dirigible catch on fire and blow up. even though they had a prototype that work they discontinued the project giving air planes the better way to travel in the air.
1.0 in a desperate attempt to revolutionize the way people traveled, the idea of the mooring was not thought over as well as it should have been. the number of problems and obstacles mounted higher and higher with the idea of mooring airships to a new mast atop the empire state building. one of these main obstacles was, while an airship was tethered to the building it would add stress,  the stress of dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation . another obstacle faced with the mooring mast was one of safety. dirigibles not from the united states used hydrogen rather than helium, which is highly flammable. another obstacle to the construction was nature itself, with high, shifting winds due to violent air currents, a dirigible tethered to the mast would swivel around and around the empire state building, the only way to prevent this would be to tie the lead weights to the rear end, but massive dangling weights, hanging over one thousand feet above the public, was not the safest idea. a last obstacle that was faced with the fact that there was an existing law that prevented airships from flying too low over urban areas. these were all obstacles that should have been thought through and realized before construction for the empire state building's mooring mast ever begin.
0.75 the builders of the empire state building faced alot of obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. one obstacle was the lack of suitable landing areas. they usually land in open fields, where they are weighed down with lead weights. in new york they would be dangling above pedestrians on the street. another obstacle was safety. most dirigibles use hydrogen, which is highly flammable. they worried an accident like the hindenburg could happen, only this time it would be above a densely populated area. another obstacle was an existing law against airships flying too low in urban areas, so it would be illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building. the final obstacle was forceful winds. they could blow the dirigible onto the sharp spires of other buildings and puncture the shell, the captain couldn't take his hands off the control levers. all in all the mooring mast was not a very well thoughtout idea and it would not have been safe at all.
0.75 on december @number @number al smith announced that the empire state building would be reaching the height of @number feet; taller then the previous largest building, the chrysler building. smith made the building taller by adding a top or a hat. john @caps described this as   the top of the empire state building  would be more than an ornament... the empire state building would be equipped for an age of transportation that was then only the dream of a few aviation pioneers  (pg @number this dream consisted of having a mooring mass at the top of the building to dock dirigible, or blimbs. however, many obsticles emerged the more they began to plan this, such as the amount of stress it would add to the buildings frame, the use of hydrogen opposed to helium, and simply nature itself.  a thousand-foot drigible held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame... the empire state building would have to...  have  over @money worth of modifications (pg @num).  most diribles from outside of the u.s used hydrogen... and hydrogen is highly flammable (pg @num) .  the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents... they would be dangling high above pedestrians... that was neither safe nor practical 
0.75 the builders of the empire state building faced many obstacle while building it, some of those obstacles being saftey, the technology they had, and, the planning that they put into building the mooring mast. there problems with the safety of the mooring mast was that, dirigibles that were from countries other than the @location use hydrogen instead of helium. hidrogen is very flammable so the risk of a fire in the dirigible was very great. also another problem the builders faced with safety was that the winds on top of the building would be much too great to succesfully land a dirigible. the problems that the builders faced with technology was that they didn't have the technology to succesfully land a @date ft dirigible at the top of a tower using a single cable because it would add stress to the buildings frame, and the stress from the wind pressure would be hazardous to the buildings frame. the obstacles that the builders faced with the planning of the mooring mast was that they didn't plan well enough and that they should have seen that the mast would be a failure from the start.
0.75 although the purpose of the mooring mast was to help dock passengers safely from the dirigible, there were many difficulties that could have endangered many.  when the german dirigible '@caps' was destroyed by fire in lakehurst, new jersey, on may @number @number the owners of the empire state building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown new york.  (paragraph @num) this shows that if an accident like a dirigibles flaming up above new york, there would be many serious injuries.  in december @number the u.s. dirigible los angeles approached the mooring mass could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds.  (paragraph @num) the toughest obstacle was to tie up the dirigible while the wind was extremely blowing at it. the idea of using the mooring mast atop of the empire state building was then, dropped.
0.75 although they made a valiant effort to make a seemingly ingenious idea into reality, the obstacles faced by the constructors of the empire state building in creating a dock for dirigibles proved to be insurmountable. one of the challenges faced by the builders was the tumutuous winds at the top of the empire state building. these forceful gales made it virtually impossible to manuever a dirigable at that elevation, much less dock it to a building. another barrier that the architects faced was the fact that there was a law saying that airships were forbidden from flying too close to the ground above urban areas. this meant that it would be even illegal for any dirigable even come close to the empire state building. finally, the creators of the empire state building faced the challenge of safety: @caps are filled with highly flammable hydrogen, and an airship explosion over a density populated urban area would have horrific results.
0.75 the builders of the empire state building faced countless problems in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. one main problem is safety. even though the dirigibles was going to be hooked on top of the building the wind could potentially whip the dirigible to crash into the building. also after the crash of the hindenburg the builders realized how much damage could be done if that were to happen in new york. another problem they faced is the laws. the law prohibited any aircraft flying too low over urban areas. these problems caused this idea to disappear.
1.0 from the idea of building the empire state building to attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, the builders faced different obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. al smith thought it was a good idea to add a mooring mast so dirigibles could dock there for several hours. however, in order to allow dirigibles to dock there, builders had to transmit all the stress of the dirigible's load and wind pressure to the building's foundation because a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building could add stress to the frame of the building. one of the greatest obstacle builders faced was the wind or nature. the strength of the wind were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. for safety reason, most dirigibles weren't safe because they mostly used hydrogen and hydrogen is flammable. another obstacle they faced was an existing law that didn't allow airships to fly too low over urban areas. irving clavan said,  the as yet unsolved problems of mooring air ships to a fixed mast at such a height made it desirable to postpone to a later date the final installation of the landing gear.  due to the obstacles the builders faced, the idea of using the mooring mast for dirigibles disappeared.
0.75 the obstacles the builders of the empire state building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was a mooring mast would add to much stress to the building's frame. the steel frame of the empire state building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation. the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas
1.0 the builders of the empire state building were faced with a multitude of problems in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. first, the building frame had to be strengthened. the weight of  the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation.  this meant that the building's frame had to be modified, which costed @num dollars. next, it proved to dangerous to dock dirigibles to the sumputous sky-scraper. after the hindenburg caught fire,  the owners of the @organization realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area.  in accordance with this danger, there was a lot existing at the time which prohibited dirigibles from flying low over urban areas. lastly, the largest obstacle engineers try to overcome was simply nature itself. winds at the top of the building made dirigibles almost impossible to land. both the columbia and the los angeles tried to dock to the mast but could not battle the wind. in conclusion, the builders of the empire state building could not get a dirigible to dock at their tower.
0.75 in the excerpt from @organization's the mooring mast, the builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock there. for example,  the lack of a suitable landing area.  architects cannot just drop a mooring mast on top of the empire state building's roof. the building would have had an extreme amount of pressure on it. in addition, along with the pressure, the dirigibles would  add stress to the building's frame.  the builders needed to modify and strengthen the steel frame of the empire state building. this also cost a great deal of money. furthermore,  the greatest reason was safety.  the slightest mistake in building the mast, could affect every person in the building. in order to allow dirigibles to dock there, the builders needed to be aware of all the citizens surrounding the building. all in all, these obstacles determined the fate of the mast.
1.0 in  the mooring mast  by @organization, it explains how the developing idea of landing a dirigible on the empire state building was eventually rejected due to many obstacles. the first design flaw that the engineers @caps was the stress the dirigible would add to the building's frame. a mass that size attached to the building by a single cable tether would be @caps in the building's foundation. the greatest obstacle the engineers @caps in allowing dirigibles to dock was safety. with the use of hydrogen, the dirigibles are highly flammable. this would have created a dangerous situation ove a  densely populated area such as downtown new york . the final obstacle the builders @caps was the wind. the winds at that height were extremely strong. chapter @num it says,  even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast.  this would create a dangerous situation for the ship's passengers. in  the mooring mast , it described how it would be nearly impossible to land dirigibles atop the empire state building.
0.5 the use of the mast on the empire state building for dirigibles faced many obstacles. violent winds, the amount of structural support and anti low-flying aircraft laws made it impossible to use. the high winds would spin the back of the aircraft and therefore the entire dirigible around the spire, and the structural support of such was extremely risky. the main interfering point however was an,  existing law against airships flying to low over urban areas. this would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area . these things inevitably lead to the mast not being put to use.
0.5 they faced challanges such as how to get the dirigibles to anchor on the building. there was really no safe way to do it. they also sayed the gas that keeps it floating is highly flamable. so it was like one big safty concern.in reality they ended up realizing its too dangerouse for them to do. if they took the chance and something went wrong innocent people could die.
0.75 while designing a dirigible docked at the top of the empire state building, the architects and engineers encountered many obstacles. being such an immense project, these obstacles came naturally. the first obstacle was purely architectural.  a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building... would add stress to the building's frame.  the architects would have to redesign the building frame in order for the building to last. the two other obstacles should have been clear from the start; the first, being nature.  the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents.  now, the dock not only would be hard to reach, but extremely unsafe. the last obstacle couldn't have been overcome by the architects or engineers if they tried, not legally anyway.  ... existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas  would also restrict the project, and actually stop it alltogether. clearly, some large deciding factors had been overlooked while designing the moor. @organization's competitive attitude made this so, but  the mooring mast... was never destined to fulfill its purpose. 
0.75 the  builders of the empire state building faced many problems in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. a @num foot dirigible would add stress to the buildings frame. most dirigibles out of the united states used hydrogen rather than helium. hydrogen is highly flammable. the acciedent of hindenburg also raised alarm. hindenburg set fire on lakehurst in new jersey. this showed the builders how much worse the acciedent could have been if it had happened over a densely populated area, such as new york. another factor were the wind currents. they were constantly @caps. this would cause the back of the dirigible to sway and move about. there was also a preexisting law stating that airships could not fly too low over urban areas. these are some of the reasons obstacles the builders fased in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the empire state building.
1.0 in the excerpt  the mooring mast  author marcia amidon l sted speaks of the obsticles that the builders of the empire state building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. first, the frame of the building had not been built to withstand a thousand foot long blimp docking to it. therefore, changes would have to be made to make the building stronger. as the excerpt says,  over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework . also, having dirigibles dock to the building would be unsafe for many reasons. for example, dirigibles were often filled with hydrogen rather than helium, and as the excerpt points out  hydrogen is highly flammable  thus, the owners of the building realized that it could cause tragedy if a blimp were to crash while flying above new york's busy streets. also, strong winds at the top of the building made it difficult and dangerous for blimps to dock at the mooring mast, because they would cause the back of the ship to constantly move. finally, there were laws preventing aircrafts to fly so low over the city. there were many obsticles in allowing dirigibles to dock to the building.
0.5 the builders of the empire state building @caps many different obstacles in trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. the @caps @caps was to be able to design the mast without having to reconstruct a big part of the building. also a big aspect of it was that they had to face was to be able to make it safe. these big dirigibles can be very flammable and having something that major in a very populated city like new york would be very risky and unsafe. the last problem they @caps was nature. of course you canot change nature so this was a problem was there since the beggining but was probably overlooked or never even thought about. so this really never would of been able to suscesfuly work without any problems.
1.0 there were three main reasons as to why the empire state building would not serve well as a mooring mast for the dirigibles. for one, it was unsafe. most of dirigibles were filled with highly flammable hydrogen and the fear of a hindenburg repeat was to great. especially over a highly populated city. two, violent air currents were present in and around new york city. docking a dirigible would be too difficult and if it were docked, the wind would make it unsafe. lastly, a law was passed that made it illegal for airships to fly too low over urban areas. this made it impossible for dirigibles to dock at the empire state building. these three obstacles were all contributing factors as to why the empire state building could not serve as a dirigible mooring mast.
0.75 the builders of the empire state building faced many problems atempting to dock dirigibles. most of these problems were safety concerns. one issue was the use of hydrogen, which is highly flamable and explosive gas. a fire acident would be catastrophic, since down town newyork is densely populated. another problem was that the tail of the dirigible could not be weighted down as it usualy is, because then thered be massive weighs dangling over the streets. with the winds blowing and the blimp not securely tethered, and not weighted, dirigibles would have swayed and moved around. that creates the risk of the blimp getting punctured by sharp edges on other buildings. also if the blimp ever successfully moored it would create tremendous stress on the building. besides the technical issues there were some obvious obstacles that oddly never got considered or addressed. the first being a law prohibiting low-altitude flights of airships over urban centers. that makes it illegal to even attempt to land, meaning there was never any remote chance of the mooring mast functioning. the second promblem was, the proper mooring equipment were never installed. that meant no attempt could ever succeed. the builders faced many obstacles building the mast but they're biggest obstacle was lack of preparation, failure to address obvious problems.
0.75 based on the excerpt,  the mooring mast  by @organization, the builders of the empire state building faced the obstacles of the use of hydrogen in dirigibles in which is highly flammable, nature itself, and an existing law in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.it stated in paragraph @num of the excerpt, most dirigibles outside the united state used hydrogen, which is very flammable. realizing that this kind of happening above an outrageously populated area such as new york city would be extremely dangerous. to explicate.  when the german dirigible hindenburg was destroyed by fire in lakehurst, new jersey, on may @number @number the owners of the empire state building realized how much worse that accident would have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown new york .however, the greatest obstale was nature itself. at the top of the building, the winds were constantly shifting. which was certainly not safe. for example,  even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast.  the builders soon realized that this issue could unfortunately, not be resolved.lastly, a more apparent obsticle that the builders faced was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. this would make it illegal for the ships to even approach the area.the obstacles of the use of hydrogen, nature itself, and an existing law, made it impossible for al smith's plan to become realistic.
0.75 the obstacles the builders of the empire state building faced made it hard to build the mooring. one problem they faced was that most of the dirigibles made outside of the @person used hydrogen rather than helium. in paragraph @num it says  when the german dirigible hindenburg was destroyed by fire, the owners of the empire state building realized how much worse it would be if that happened in new york city which is highly populated.  @caps obstacle was mother nature. winds at the topof the building were constantly changing. in paragraph @num the author states  the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself.  the last obstacle was laws against airships flying too low over urban areas. in paragraph @num the author states  this law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area .
0.75 there were several obsticles the builders of the empire state building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. one reason was one of sefty.  most dirigibles from outside of the united states used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable.  if an accident would occur above a densely populated area, such as new york, it would be catastrophic. another obsticle was nature itself.  the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. even if the dirigibles were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast.  another obsticle the builders had was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas.
1.0 based on the excerpt,  the mooring mast,  various obstacles were faced in the challenge of docking dirigibles atop the empire state building's mooring mast. the first challenge the builders faced was that of nature.  the greatest obstacle ...was nature itself.  (@num) the violent winds that high up would cause the dirigible to swing unpredictably, making it unsafe. another problem arose when the  hindenburg  caught fire in new jersey.  most dirigibles from outside the united states used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable.  (@num) if a hydrogen-filled dirigible would catch fire while at the empire state building, it could be very dangerous for both the building and the pedestrians below. the last obstacle was a law.  ...existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas.  (@num) this law made it illegal for any aircraft to fly even remotely close to the empire state building. in the excerpt,  the mooring mast,  the builders faced many obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the empire state building.
0.75 when designing the mooring mast for the empire state building there were many challenges architects and builders had to over come. first were the basic problems of any transportation hub, how to move people and baggage around the terminal. another more complicated problem was how the compensates for the added stress on the building's frame from the dirigible's load and the wind pressure. this problem was solve by @money redesign of the empire state building frame. also mored dirigibles would be constantly swing around due to the violent wind currents at the top of the empire state building. weights could not be used to hold the airship in place because it would be a danger to people on the streets below. the architects could not design a way to hold it drigible in place. eventually the idea of a mooring mast for dirigibles at the top of the empire state building was scrapped.
1.0 although there were great hopes for the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock on the empire state building, many obstacles were faced while trying to reach this dream. one obstacle noticed while designing the mast to dock on, was that the height and weight of a dirigible would greatly add stress to the building's frame. this would then be transmitted to the building's foundation as well. this clearly possessed a problem bigger than the empire state building could withstand. another reason that builders faced an obstruction in the hopes of allowing dirigibles to dock was safety reasons. one of the most apparent problems, was that most dirigibles outside of the @location were fueled by hydrogen gas, opposed to helium gas. this posed a threat, for hydrogen is highly flammable. putting a densely populated area such as downtown new york at risk consequently came as an obstacle for builders. the nature itself came as one of the last problems for such a dream. winds that were constantly shifting due to extreme air currents, at the top of the building could easily cause the back of the dirigible to spin around the mooring mast. again putting thousands of people below the building, was neither practical nor safe.  as quoted by the passage,  the mooring mast of the empire state building was never destined to fulfill its purpose... , clearly posing many obstacles in allowing to dock dirigibles on such a building.
1.0 the mooring mast atop the empire state buildings problems should have been foreseeable before its construction. the workers building it were certainly against the odds during its construction. the top of the empire state building was in a constant weather crisis,  winds were constantly shifting due to violent air currents . this meant that a dirigible that would attach to the mooring mast would be swaying in the wind. on land, dirigibles have lead dead weights that weighted the back so it didn't sway but that just wasn't practical hanging over crowded city streets. also, the building could not support a dirigible without transferring its energy back down to the foundation. this meant that the entire building had to be reinforced to move the energy. it was also illegal for dirigibles to fly that low over urban areas, and since most @caps blimps were using hydrogen, a highly flammable substance, the safety of the project was questioned. after the hindenburg, people seemed more reluctant to support such a project and even the owners of the empire state building realized how catastrophic an accident over a place like downtown new york could be. overall, the theory of a mooring mast atop the empire state building would remain a theory due to predictable obstacles.
0.5 there was one major problem with the dirigibles docking on the empire state building. this major problem was that the mooring mast is so high up in the air and downtown new york where the empire state building is located is such a crowded area. if something goes wrong it will affect a huge area because new york is such an urban area. it is a good idea but al smith did not take all the precautions that he needed to. because if something does go wrong a lot will go wrong because downtown new york is such a crowded area. thats the main obstacle that the builders had to overcome with letting dirigibles dock on the mooring mast of the empire state building.
0.75 intended uses for buildings often are met with challenges. in the article  the mooring @caps  by @person, the obstacles faced in allowing dirigibles to dock at the empire state building are discussed. the first obstacle faced is stated in paragraph @num, when to build a dock on top of the building the entire building would have to be inforced. this was an obstacle because it would be at a cost of @money. another obstacle faced was the weather. above the building violent air currents rage. these currents would cause the ship to swivel around and around the mooring. the final obstacle in allowing dirigibles to dock was the law. according to the article,  an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas... would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building.  the cost of reinforcing the building, the weather, and the laws were three obstacles faced in docking blimps to the empire state building.
0.5 based on the excerpt  the mooring mast  by @person, the builders of the empire state building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. nature itself was one of the greatest obstacles they faced.  the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents.  also the  dirigibles moored in open landing fields, could be weighted down in the back with lead weights, but using those at the empire state building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street was neither practical nor safe. another reason dirigibles could not dock there was because of the law against airships flying too low to urban areas. overall, the builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.
0.75 in the excerpt, the builders and architects building the empire state building had numerous problems trying to build the mast on the top of the building. one reason was that they built it before even considering the problems it may cause. the biggest problem was safety:  the hydrogen used in the dirigibles was highly flammable.  another problem was wind:  they would never be able to use the mooring mast because of the violent winds shifting at that height.  if the dirigible was ever tied to the building,  it's back end would swivel around and around the mooring mast.  the derigibles moored in fields could be held down with lead weights but using those @num feet above downtown new york would not be safe at all. the final problem was a law against airships flying that low over cities and pedestrians. so, neadless to say, it wouldn't work out.
0.75 there were many obstacles the builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the empire state building. one obstacle they faced is the safety of the passengers when the dirigibles would dock and the frame work of the building wouldn't collapse. i know this because in between paragraph @num and @num the excerpt says,  'one set of egineers are here in new york is trying to dope out a practical, workable arrangement and the government people in washington are figuring on some safe way of mooring airships to this mast.'  the mast weighs alot so they're afraid it will put too much pressure on the empire state building. the egineers were also afraid of the dirigibles blowing up because the dirigibles use hydrogen. hydrogen is way more flammable than helium. i know this because in between paragraph @num and @num it says,  most dirigibles from outside of the united states used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. these were a few of many obstacles the workers faced
1.0 the empire state building is known for its great size & distinctive shape in new york city's @caps, but what most people probably do not know is that the tower on top is actually a mooring mast for dirigibles. this is probably a little known fact because it could never actually be used to dock blimps for numerous reasons: safety, nature, & the law.the mast would have revolutionized travel in new york if international dirigibles could stop there after long transatlantic flights, however, because of the gas used by foreign blimps, safety would have been a huge issue. in paragraph @num, the author states,  most dirigibles from outside the u.s used hydrogen rather than helium, & hydrogen is highly flammable.  there was even an accident with the german hindenburg, & if a blimp caught fire over densely populated @caps this would be an even greater problem of safety. nature was also a matter of safety that needed to be considered. at such a great height there are strong, unpredictable winds, &  even if the dirigibles were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around & around the mooring mast  (paragraph @num). there were no means of anchoring the back of the blimp because heavy weights such as those which would be used in open field landings would pose a serious threat hanging off the back of a blimp from over @num feet with pedestrians below there was simply no practical way to combat the nature that prevented the possibility of blimp stocking.finally, it would have been illegal for a dirigible to dock at the mooring mass on the empire state building. it was against the law for  airships flying too low over urban areas  (  @num). the law ended up being the final obstacle that could not be overcome, so the empire state building never became a docking post for blimps, but it is still an incredible architectural feat.
0.5 there was many different obstacles the builders of the empire state building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. one obstacle faced was to their expanded use in new york city was the lack of a suitable landing area. another obstacle was that most dirigibles from outside of the united states used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. those were some of the different obstacles they faced which caused the lack of success.
0.75 during the construction of the empire state building, there were several obstacles the builders faced to have the dirigibles be able to dock on the empire state building. the first obstacle the builders faced was figuring out how to modify and strengthen steel frame of the empire state building to accommodate the mooring mast on top of the building. these modifications would cost over sixty thousand dollars, which was a lot of money back in the @date's. once the builders finished framing the entire building, the greatest obstacle to constructing the mooring mast came to be. this obstacle was nature itself. violent air currents would have the back of the blimps swivel around and around the mast. the blimp would need weights to hold it steady, but these weights would be hanging over people on the street and this was neither practical nor safe.
0.25 in  the mooring mast  by marcia amidon l sted, the obstacles the builders of the empire state building faced was having to try and make it perfect, especially for the designers. they went through alot of work, effort, and time. they tried to make different arrangements for the government people. the dirigibles were always near the mooring mast. they were afraid that it would knock over one day. they also, wanted them to become the transportation of the future. the transportation was to the airplanes. the dirigibles became the world's highest soda fountain and tea garden for the sightseers. so, their plans didn't quite work out as planned, but everything else seemed to work out okay.
1.0 the builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. one clear obstacle was the law that had existed at the time making it against the law for airships to fly too low over urban areas. (paragraph @num). also, another obstacle in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the empire state building was that most dirigibles from outside of the united states used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flamable. for example on may @number @number the german dirigible hindenburg was destroyed by fire in lakehurst, new jersey. the owners of the empire state building realized how much worse the accident could have been it had taken place in downtown new york. (paragraph @num). the greatest obstacle was nature itself. the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast (paragraph @num). the obstacles the builders of the empire state building faced were too much to allow dirigibles to dock on the mooring mast.
0.5 the builders had many troubles with the building of the empire state building.  most dirigibles from outside of the united states used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. this is one trouble they had because if the dirigibles ever was an acident abuve new york city it would be bad because new york is so poluted.another problem was ,they could not simply drop a moorning mast on top of the empire state building's flat roof.  this was a big problem because now they had to fix their desing. lastly another problem was the compotition,  al smith relized that he was close to loosing the title of the worlds talest building. al smith was so caught up in his desing he did not relize the compotition. so when he found out he knew had to make his taller.
1.0 the builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock their. one obstacle was that a dirigible moored at the top of the building held by single cable, would add stress to the buildings frame. the still frame of the building would have to be modified and strengthened to withstand the stress of the dirigibles load and wind pressure. the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. the winds were constantly shifting due to violent air currents, causing the ship to swivel around and around the mooring mast. another major obstacle was that there was an existing law against airships flying to low over urban areas. this would make it illegal for the ships to ever tie up or even approached the building. the last obstacles the builders had to get around was the issue with safety. most dirigibles used either helium or hydrogen, both highly flammable gases. when the hindenburg was destroyed by fire, the builders realized how dangers that could be over a populated area. these are just some of the many obstacles the builders of the empire state building had to take into consideration when attempting to allow dirigible to dock their.
0.25 the obstacles builders of the empire state building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock they are making sure they dont bump into other buildings, and they use rope to drop down the papers. they are trying to make sure that the dirigibles do not pop if it touches the buildings. it is also trying to keep the dirigibles away so they don't get to close and thats why they are droping the papers down with ropes @caps if they built a little tunnel so the dirigibles can go in they won't have to worry about them getting popped if they touch a building.
1.0 in their attempt to build a docking mast on the top of the empire state building, the builders came up on structural, safety, and practicality obstacles. in order to have the mast on top of the building the builders had to strengthen the steel,  over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications . also, they had safety concerns about letting a dirigible dock in a city, on a skyscraper. one of these concerns was the use of the flamable gas hydrogen that was used in non-american dirigibles. if a dirigible caught fire over the city the effects of it would be bad. furthermore, the tether system of the mooring mast was at the will of nature.  the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting, this meant the dirigible on the mast could then swivel around, making it danger to citizens. the mast was also in-practical, due to a law that prohibits airships from flying too low over urban areas. and finally, in later years dirigibles had  given way to airplanes,  thus making the mooring mast for dirigibles useless. the builders of the empire state building never succeeded in their attempt of putting an active mooring mast on top of the building, because of structural, safety, and practicality obstacles that they stumbled upon.
0.0 the obstacles the builders of the empire @caps building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. so people can get off and unload or load up their ship.
1.0 there were many obstacles that the architects never realized while building the docking station for the dirigibles.  one of these obstacles they faced was height, and the lack of safety that arose from it.  in @date, the german dirigible  hindenburg , which use a highly flammable hydrogen, caught fire in new jersey as described in paragraph thirteen.  should this have happened to a dirigible docked high over new york city, the airship would plummet to to the ground where many new @caps would be going about about their day.  the largest obstacle they faced though was nature.  air currents and storms would cause the dirigible, only teathered to the mooring mast by a rope, to  swivel around and around the mooring mast... dangling high above pedestrians on the street.   as pointed out in paragraph fourteen, this was neither practical, nor say if.  the third obstacle they faced with a pre-existing law against airships flying too low over urbanized areas.  even as tall as the empire state building is, it was still impossible to legally dock at the new mooring mast.  al smith's idea finally had to be abandoned due to safety, nature, and state law.
1.0 in the excerpt  the mooring mast  by marcia amidon l sted, many obstacles were described that got in the way of allowing dirigibles to dock on the empire state building. one obstacle was that the empire state building had a flat roof and the framework of the building would have to be made stronger to put the mooring mast on there. the architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the empire state building's flat roof.  it cost more than @money to modify the framework. another obstacle was the law.  flying to low over urban areas  was illegall so it would be impossible for a dirigible to even go near the empire state building. lastly, the biggest obstacle was safety. blimps that were being flown around new york were made using hydrogen, which is flamable. also,  the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents.  it wouldn't be safe to hook a blimp up in those winds where it would be shifting all around. ofcourse, it was also a safety hazard because thousands of pedestrians would be walking on the road below,  where  the dirigibles  would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street,  it would be terrible if one fell. it should have been obvious that hooking dirigibles to a mast on the empire state building was not going to work.
0.75 first, there was no way to anchor any dirigibles. they couldn't make the back stable, only if they added lead weights; that wasn't a good idea above a crowded street. second, there were laws in place stating that a dirigible couldn't fly that close to buildings. also, when the german blimp hindenburg was destroyed by fire near a new jersey naval base, people thought  ... how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown new york.  @caps, the wind that high up was too fierce and strong for a blimp to even get close to the building. all in all it was a bad idea.
1.0 the obstacles the builders of the empire state building faced in attempting to allow dirigables to dock there was that the stress of the dirigables load and wind pressure could have caused problems to the buildings foundation. a thousand-foot dirigble, held by a single cable tether. would add stress to the buildings frame.safety was another issue, most dirigbles outside the united states used hydrogen, instead of helium. this is a problem because hydro gen is highly flammable. on may @number @number the german dirigble hindenburg was destroyed by fire in new jersey. the accident would have been more dangerous in new york because the city is densely populated.another reason why they faced problems to allow dirigables to dock is because there was an existing law against airships flying too close over urban areas. in december @number the @organization dirigble did attempt to reach the mooring mast but could not reach because of the winds, fearing that it may blow the dirigble onto sharp spires of other buildings. this would puncture the dirigbles shell.
0.75 in  the mooring mast  by @organization, there were many obstacles the builders of the empire state building were faced with in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. there were obstacles such as the fact that if a dirigible were tied to the building by a single tether it would  add stress to the building's frame.  to fix the problem, over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building. another problem was that some dirigibles used hydrogen rather than helium. hydrogen is highly flammable which would be very dangerous to have over a densely populated area. the  greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself.  by this, l sted means that there are many violent air currents at the top of the building, meaning that the ship would swivel around and around. to make sure this would not happen, lead wieghts would have to be used which would not be practical or safe to have  dangling high above pedestrians.  in the end, people realized there were far too many problems involved in the use of a mooring mast at the top of the empire state building.
1.0 the builders of the empire state building had great plans to allow dirigibles, also known as blimps, to dock there. although they kept their expectations high, they faced many obstacles while trying to make this happen. the first problem they ran into was the fact that the steel frame of the building would have to be strengthened due to the stress of the dirigible's load. so, the architects had to make changes to the building's skeleton. safety was also an issue because hydrogen made the blimps flammable, which could cause a destruction by fire. there was also an existing law stating  airships can't fly to low over urban areas.  @caps, dirigibles wouldn't be allowed to tie up to the building, let alone even reach that area.  the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself.  due to heavy winds, the dirigibles would swivel around too much, and the area was not open enough to weigh down the back with lead weights. so, the architects of the empire state building faced too many obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to successfully dock there.
0.75 the builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles to allowing dirgibles to dock there. one obstacle was the wind at the top of the building. the winds there were  constantly shifting due to violent air currents . this made it dangerous for a dirigible to stop there. another obstacle was a law against flying dirigibles over cities. the law made it  illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area . since they were banned from doing this, no pilot would ever more there. a third obstacle was the decreasing use of dirigibles.  with the hindenburg incident on may @number @number and the increasing use of airplanes, not many people few on airships anymore. in conclusion, several obstacles prevented the docking of dirgibles to the empire state building.
0.0 in the excerpt called  the mooring mast, by marcia amidon l sted on pages @number @num, @num, @num. she is basicly explainning the obstacles of the builders of the empire state building and how it faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. examples are on page @number  they said that the empire state building would be more than ornamental, more than a spire or dome or a pyramid put there to add a desired few feet to the height of the building or to mask something as mundane as a water tank.
0.75 the obstacles that the builders of the empire state building faced in attempting to allow blimps to dock there was the height of the building. for instance in paragraph @num it states  the steel frame of the building would have to be modified, over six thousand dollars worth of modifications  this proves that the height of the empire was its height because the city had to pay modification fees. also, because the building is so tall the mast is not that stable so that was the main obstacle stated in paragraph @num  the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents  this demonstrates that mast in those currents and not being stable enough could be very dangerous for downtown new york. lastly, even state laws became an obstacle for the dirigibles such as in paragraph @num it states  this law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building  this justifies that this was also an obstacle that the builders faced
1.0 based on the excerpt 'the mooring mast' by marcia amidon l sted, there are many varied obstacles the builders of the empire state building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. one main reason would be the safety issues of the dirigible. most dirigibles used hydrogen to be lighter than air. hydrogen is a very flammable gas that could easily catch fire, just like the hindenburg. if an accident like the hindenburg were to happen over downtown new york, the outcome would not be good. also dirigibles moored in open fields and would need to be anchored with big lead weights. these weights would niether be practical nor safe dangling above people and a small moring on the top of a building is no open field. one last obstacle is the sixty thousand dollars needed to just make the frame suitable for mooring dirigibles.  a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of a building held by a single cable tether would add stress to the buildings frame.  with out a doubt, just to make a mooring for dirigibles at the top of the tallest building in the world would come with many different obstacles the builders would have to face.
0.75 the builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. the hydrogen in the dirigibles was highly flammable, winds shifted a lot, and existing laws made it illegal to dock in such an area. most dirigibles during that time. were floating by hydrogen rather than helium. with the builders found out was hydrogen is very flammable and too risky to land dirigibles that could catch on fire above a whole city. the excerpt also explained that nature was a huge issue. air currents as high as those a top the buildings were vicious and shifted rapidly which would make it dangling dirigibles from that high up very risky. lastly, was the obstacle of breaking the law! the law against airships flying to low over urban areas. with all these obstacles that would be too difficult for the builders face, this unreal dream would yet remain a dream.
0.75 the builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles while trying to make a for dirigibles. the first obstacle was creating the mooring mast. in @caps four it says,  this dream of the aviation pioneers was travel by dirigible, or zepplin, and the empire state building was going to have a mooring mast at its top for docking these new airships.  the empire state building's frame wasn't strong enough for the mooring mast, so the builders had to modify it. in @caps nine they say,  the steel frame of the empire state building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation.  an obstacle that stopped the use of the mooring mast was the wind. in @caps fifthteen they were not able to dock,  the u.s. navy dirigible los angeles approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds. another obstacle they faced was safty. in @caps @num they describe that,  most dirigibles from outside of the united states used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. there are problems that the builders could fix and could'nt fix.
0.75 there are many obstacles the builders of the empire state building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. one issue was the stress the dirigible would add to the building. over sixty thousand dollars modifications had to be made to the buildings framework. also, most dirigibles contained hydrogen which is highly flammable and dangerouss. another dangerous aspect is that this huge piece of material would be dangling high above pedestrians, as opposed to there much safer usual landing of open fields. lastly, there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas, which would also cause docking issues.
0.75 builders of the empire state building faced a few problems when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there one problem was that a large dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by one single cable tether would add stress to the frame of the building. the stress of the dirigible and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted almost eleven hundred feet below, to the building's foundation. this in turn means that the builders would have to go back and modify the frame of the empire state building in order for it to be strong enough to accommodate the dirigibles. over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications would have to be made. as construction proceeded, once the framing had been complete up to the @number floor, the roof had to be completed before the framing for the mooring mast could take place.
0.75 based on the excerpt, the obstacles the builders of the empire state building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were safety, existing laws, and the changes in air currents. many of the dirigibles  from outside of the united states used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable  (@num). the owners of the empire state building realized that a much worse situation would happen it were to catch on fire  above a densely populated area  (@num). another practical reason why dirigibles cald not moor at the top of the building was that there was  an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas  (@num). the airship would be  dangling  high above pedestrians on the streets , which is pretty unsafe (@num). the last obstacle that the builders faced was the shift in air currents on top of the building. if the dirigibles were tied to the mooring mast,  the back of the ship would swivel around and around (@num). this could be dangerous for pedestrians on the street, as well as passengers coming on and of the dirigildes. these practical reasons called for the idea of the mooring mast to be diminish.
0.75 in this fascinating story  the mooring mast  written by author marcia amidon l sted tell about the empire state building, & it's enormousity. although constructing this building took workers time and strength they didn't exactly get the purpose of the mooring mast. there were many reasons why they faced conflicts in attempting to let the dirigibles dock in the mooring mast. for example the dirigible was made up of helium rather than hydrogen, & hydrogen is highly flammable, so if they were to dock in downtown new york city it would have been a complete tragedy. another reason is because dirigibles were moored in open landing fields, so it could weighted down. author marcia writes  but using these at the empire state building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the streets was neither practical nor safe.  that's how & there's many more reasons why workers have trouble building the mooring mast.
0.5 the builders of the empire state building faced many different obstacles to allow dirigibles to dock there. the major obstacle to allow dirigibles to dock there was the lack of a suitable landing area. to allow dirigibles to anchor at empire state building for several hours a mooring mast had to be added to the top of the building. the architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the empire buildings flat roof, so rather than building a utilitarian mast without any ornamentation, the architects designed a shiny glass and chrome nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from inside. once architects had designed the mooring mast it could be complete and useful. the greatest obstacle to the successful use of mooring mast was nature itself. those are some of the obstacles the builders had to face to allow dirigibles to dock on the empire state building.
0.75 while builders tried to figure out a way for dirigibles to dock at the empire state building, there were some obstacles faced. if a dirigible was held by a single cable, this would add stress to the building's frame. the dirigible would have to be cabled at the top which was also difficult because of the empire state's flat roof. also weather was a huge obstacle.  the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents.  (@caps @num, line @num) the wind would cause the dirigible to sway and not be very stable. builders had to also keep in mind that using the building could be harmful to pedestrians as well, the dirigibles would be too close to the ground. the planning of where these aircrafts to land and re-fill was not an easy task for the builders.
1.0 in the excerpt from  the mooring mast , the author, marcia amidon l sted, is informant on the structural and natural obstacles faced by the builders of the empire state building. one obstacle faced by the builders was involved with the structure of the building. the issue was that a moored dirigible, or blimp, would add a significant amount of stress to the building's frame. to fix this problem, the  frame of the empire state building would have to be modified and strengthened.  another obstacle faced by the builders involved nature. the winds on top of the building were violent and often shifted directions. this hindered the ability of a dirigible to moor on top of the building and remained a problem. the final obstacle faced was a restriction on the flight of airships over urban areas. this restriction made it impossible for dirigibles to moor on top of the empire state building. the excerpt explains the structural and natural obstacles faced by the builders.
0.75 the designers of the empire state building faced many challenges in the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock on it's peak.  the greatest reason was safety  (para @num). the dirigibles were dangerous. strong winds could blow them in different directions, possibly hitting the building. and if there was a crash, the debris would rain upon new york city. since there was wind, they would have to use lead weights to hold a dirigible in place. however above the city this would be  neither practical nor safe  (para @num). finally, there was a law prohibiting airships from flying low over urban areas. this would cause the docking to be illegal. for these reasons, the builders of the empire state building faced challenges allowing blimps, or dirigibles, to dock on the building.
0.5 there were many obstacles for the builders of the mast attempting to allow dirigibles to dock, such as laws, nature, and overlooked detail. laws were an obstacle because of safety risks of having a dirigible over a densely populated area, such as the hindenburg accident. nature was a problem because of the violent winds at the top of the mast, which would make the ship unsteady. the last obstacle was that the builders of the mast overlooked all the other obstacles, and safety risks.
0.75 al smith and his workers, went through quite a bit while working on this building. as an example, while building it they had to transmitt the stress of the dirigibles load all the way to the buildings foundation, which was around eleven hundred feet below. after that they would have to modify and strengthen the frame of the building to accommodate the new situation. the greatest obstacle throughout the whole process though was the nature itself. due to violent air currents the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting. safety was a major obstacle smith had to face while building this building. smith thought a dirigible would be okay to use on the building but little did he know how dangerous using one could be. due to the fact most dirigibles from outside the @location used hydrogen rather than helium, using hydrogen, meant highly flammable.
0.25 in the novel the @caps of the empire state building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, because in the novel it said  a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame.  this quote said that the dirigible would add stress to the building and @caps risk of colapsing.
0.5 the builders of the empire states building encoutered many obstacles in the attempt to allow blimps to dock on the building. the engineers realized from the start that even if they could get a blimp docked, it would put additional stress on the buildings structure. to fix this, they had to reinforce the entire building. in addition to this, the docking of a blimp was dangerous in itself. it could easily be destroyed like the hindenburg
0.5 the builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles especially with the construction of the mooring mast due to the height of the building. first, due to the alleged, projected height of the mast there were concerns on how to evenly distribute the dirigible's weight. the structure of the dirigible and the fact that it was lighter than air was crucial to understand. taking this into account, the builders had to figure out how to have the whole building support the dirigible's weight and not just the top mast. had the dirigible be supported by only the mast itself, the dirigible's weight would probably pulled the mast right out of the building. another obstacle the builders faced was the delicate nature of the mooring mast. the mast was not made in a business fashion, but more of an extravagant manner, with much of it made out of glass because of many windows. this made the mast's installation a lot more harder because they had to watch the mast be installed from all areas. the builders faced many obstacles in making sure that the empire state building was acceptable for dirigible docking.
0.75 the builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.  the mooring mast  by marcia amidon l sted shares some of the obstacles that were dealt with when trying to make it possible for blimps to land atop the empire state building. l sted discusses the obstacles of nature, safety, laws, and construction in  the mooring mast . nature presented a huge setback in terms of docking dirigibles. as l sted writes,  even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast . the safety of docking blimps on the empire state building also became issue.  the owners of the empire state building realized how much worse  an accident could be if it happened above downtown new york, instead of in a field. the laws in affect of the time made it illegal for airships to fly too low over urban areas. this law makes docking a dirigible impossible in new york city. the construction alone of accommodating a mooring mast required  over @num dollars worth of modifications  and a lot of time and planning. as l sted says,  the mooring mast of the empire state building was destined to never fufill its purpose . the obstacles presented in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the empire state building were too great and too many. the laws, safety, construction, and nature of the time were too big a setback for this endeavor.
1.0 in the mooring mast by @organization, many contractors were exceedingly determined to construct a mast on the empire state building to sanction the use of dirigibles, or blimps, to be the way of air travel for the future. there were great amounts of obstacles in the way of making this a reality. allowing dirigibles to dock on the empire state building was a fantastic idea, but at the same time, proved to be just an impossible theory.the first problem was the weight of the blimp with the combined malicious winds, to eventually shatter the beautiful framework of the building.  the stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below.  architects soon fixed that problem when they impulsively spent over sixty thousand dollars on changes to the building to support this flaw, but this was not the only problem. the second major concern was the hydrogen that would be filling these blimps.  most dirigibles from outside of the united states used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable.  hydrogen can easily create fires, which is a top concern in a densely populated city such as new york city. the most immense obstacle was mother nature.  the winds on top of buildings were constantly shifting due to violent air currents.  with dirigible flying above thousands of civilians, an uncontrolled aircraft due to high winds is not safe. the last impractical reason why this idea was not realistic was because of the law that forbade airships to fly too low in urban areas. all of those obstacles made building a mast on the empire state building only a dream.al smith, the architect of the empire state building, came up with fascinating ideas. although they were great, they did not work. between the environment, winds, hydrogen use, and safety laws, his dream was just a hoax. these obstacles made it impossible to proceed construction. al smith had amazing imagination with bad luck.
0.5 dirigibles had a top speed of eighty milles per hour, and they could cruise at seventy milles per hoor for thousands of milles witout needing refueling. some were as long as one thousand feet the same length as four bloks in new york city. the one obstacole to their expanded use in new york was the lak of a suitable landing area. the greatest obstacle to the sucsessful use of the mooring mast was nature it salf a window on the top were constantly @caps due to biolent air corents.
0.5 in the excerpt  the mooring mast  by marcia amidon l sted, workers building the empire state building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles, or blimps to dock there. at first al smith, who headed efforts to construct the empire state building, was really trying to win  ... the title of world's tallest building...  against the architect building the chrysler building. then al smith had an idea that would make his building over @num taller than the chrysler building. al smith decided he would add a to the building to serve as a mooring mast for derigibles.  the empire state building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation.   over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made... .  the architects and engineers of the empire state building consulted with the experts...  to make sure everything would be safe and in check. the builders went through such trouble and  the mooring mast of the empire state building was destined to never fufill its purpose... . after so much work and effort the mooring mast never got put to use because  dirigibles moored... at the empire state building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe. 
1.0 in the mooring @caps by marcia amidon l sted, the builders of the empire state building faced obstacles in attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. one of the main problems was nature.  the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents,  which made it dangerous for dirigible to be turning around the building above pedestrians.another obstacle that the builders raced was that the dirigibles used hydrogen, rather than helium. hydrogen is highly flammable, and the owners of the empire state building did not want a dirigible to catch fire above a  densely populated area such as downtown new york. the last obstacle faced in attempt to allow dirigibles to dock on the empire state building was the law against airships flying too low over urban areas. this law made  it illegal for ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area. 
0.5 the empire state building faced obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles,  enormous steel framed balloons  commonly called blimps, dock there. one of the main issues was the pressure on the building caused by the dirigibles. as said in the excerpt the @caps @caps, by @organization,  the stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below.  (paragraph @num). over @money worth of modifications were made to strengthen and accommodate for this new situation of dirigibles.
1.0 the builders of the empire state building faced numerous obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. while designing the mast, the architects faced problems including wind pressure, safety, and practicality. the frame was not strong enough to undergo the stress and wind pressure from the load of the dirigible. the foundation of the building, which was approximately @num feet below, would have had to be strengthened and modified if it was going to be able to handle the movement of the dirigible attached by a single cable tether. safety was the greatest obstacle that the builders faced most dirigibles used hydrogen to make them lighter than the air. however, this hydrogen was highly flammable causing many dangers. since new york city is such a thickly settled area, the risk of a fire was too dangerous to take. finally, instead of dirigibles landing in open fields they would have to dock eleven hundred feet above the ground in the words of marcia amidon l sted,  using these (dirigibles) at the empire state building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe. 
0.75 there was three main obstacles the builders of the empire state building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, the densely populated area, the violent air currents, and the existing law against airships. first, most dirigibles from outside of the united states used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. since the dock would be above downtown new york, there is a higher risk of the dock blowing up due to the density. secondly, nature was a great obstacle. there were many winds on top of the building and the wind currents were constantly changing violently, there was a gigantic fear of the dirigible swiveling around and hitting another building. finally, the dock could never allow a ship to be tied up legally due to the existing law of airships flying too low over urban areas. the dirigible would not be safe, and the entire idea will drop. for these reasons or obstacles, many builders of the empire state building faced while attempting to allow blimps to dock there.
0.75 the builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles in the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there and those obstacles include: the lack of a suitable landing area in @location, a mooring mast was needed to the top of the building so dirigibles or blimps could anchor there for several hours for fuel, services, and to let passengers on and off, the steel frame of the empire state building had to be modified and strengthened because a thousand-foot blimp mooring at the top of the building held by a cable tether would cause stress to the building frame. the blimps load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all through the buildings foundation which was somewhere about eleven hundred feet below. the last obstacle in the allowing blimps to dock at the empire state building was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas which would make it illegal for a dirigible to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area.
0.75 the builders of the empire state building faced @caps obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. the most blatant one was the height at which they would dock. al smith states  the empire state would reach the height of @num feet,  @caps dirigibles from outside the u.s. were extremly flammable. if one caught fire while moored to the top of the empire state building the results would have been catastrophic because it would happen over a densly populated area. another obstacle was wind. if the ship was tethered to the mast the back of it would constantly swivel around. using led weights to secure the back would not be safe or practical. the last one was a law that made flying a dirigible too low over a urban area illegal. no ship would be allowed to fly over downtown new york.
0.5 in the excerpt,  the mooring mast,  by. marcia amidon l sted, the al smith wanted to make the tallest building in new york. he had made the building very tall, @number feet tall to be exact, but then, the empire state building was made taller, @number feet. it was basically a competition to see who was to have the tallest building in new york. a mooring mast was put on top of each building for more height. although, the builders did not account the balloons, or dirigibles that pass in the air. dirigibles are highly flammable, and if they so happen come in contact with a mooring mast, it could be destroyed, just like before,  the german dirigible hindenburg was destroyed by fire in lakehurst, new jersey, on may @number @number the mast could have caused huge chaos to new york if it did damage upon a dirigible passing in the air.
0.5 from the excerpt the mooring mast there where many obstacles the builders of the empire state building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. the first thing was safety. and that states used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. the greatest obstacle the @caps use of the mooring mast was nature itself. the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast. they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe.
0.75 the builders of the empire state building faced many problems and obstacles while attempting to allow blimps to dock there. one of their obstacles was that foreign blimps used hydrogen not helium to stay in the air. if it blew up over new york the damage and death rate would be catastrophic. a second obstacle that they faced was that the elevation of the building was @caps high that there were strong wind currents. making it difficult for the navy's blimp the los angeles to come @caps the docking station at the mooring mast. their final obstacle that they faced was the fear of the blimps going @caps another buildings spire bursting a hole in the blimp: causing it to crash.the builders faced many obstacles such as the danger and high risk of a foreign blimp trying to dock and ends up blowing up since they are filled with hydrogen and not helium. also since it is at such a high elevation the heavy wind currents make it difficult for the blimps to get close enough to be able to dock. finally the fear of the blimp going @caps another buildings spire puncturing a hole in the blimp causing it to crash.
1.0 the builders of the empire state building faced many challenges with dirigibles. the first being that with the large size of the aircrafts it would put much stress on the building and so a new frame was created to accomadate the @num ft dirigibles. sixty thousand dollars was needed for modifications. another problem was safety. a lot of dirigibles out of the united states used hydrogen which is highly flammable and different accident like in new jersey, where the blimp caught fire, were to happen in the heavely populated new york a lot of injuries and deaths would occur. a third reason is nature. since the building stood so tall, wind speeds and pressure was very unpredictable, especially with the violent air currents. in open fields weights were used to stabilize dirigibles, but having lead weights  dangling high above pedestrians... was neither practical nor safe.  @caps, there were laws against flying at certain altitudes in urban areas. the empire state building being at the height it was, was still illegal to have a dirigible or other craft tie up to it. those are obstacles the builders faced when building the empire state building.
0.0 the builders of the empire state building went through many obstacles. i feel bad for them because of how dangerous it was, and how long they had to work. at the same time i would have been happy to be apart of something like that. the builders could have died doing there job. building it so high up, it must have been hot. i dont think it had to be that high they could have done the same thing but lower. those are some of the obstacles i think the builders went through.
0.75 while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the empire state building, the builders ran into a few obstacles. one obstacle was a previously existing law about airships flying too low over urban areas like downtown new york. another problem the builders ran into was high winds causing the back end of the dirigible to swing in the wind, making it unsafe for passengers unloading. unlike dirigibles moored in open fields, lead weights could not be used to weigh the back of the dirigible down because they would be dangerous for pedestrians on the street. another safety issue was most balloons outside the united states filled dirigibles with hydrogen which is much more flammable than helium. dirigibles filled with hydrogen could cause a disaster if it ever caught on fire. although the idea seemed great at first, the builders at the empire state building realized it was not practical or safe.
0.75 based on the excerpt, it is clear that the builders of the mooring mast atop of the empire state building faced multiple problems. to begin, the excerpt states that dirigibles from other countries were often filled with hydrogen, which is extremely flammable. the danger of hydrogen was demonstrated when the german dirigible  hindenburg  burst into flames. the hindenburg incident could have been far worse if it had happened in a densely populated area, such as new york city. aside from the fire @caps the mooring mast would create, there was also a ban on low flying aircraft so in densely populated areas. according to the excerpt though, the greatest obstacle was  nature itself.  this was a reference to the powerful winds and violent gusts found at the peak of the empire state building. with those winds, it would be outstandingly difficult to control a dirigible safely. after realizing all of these complications and obstacles, it was decided that the mooring mast would not be built.
0.25 the builders of the empire state building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. one of the obstacles faced was making sure that the people below would not get hurt. if something happened to fall, someone could get hurt. another obstacle faced was the law against airships flying too low over urban areas. that's the obstacles that the builders of the empire state building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.
1.0 in the article   the mooring mast,  by marcia amidon l sted it is apparent that the builders of the empire state building faced many challenges, during the attempt of trying to dock dirigibles. the dirigibles themselves could be a hazard.  ... most dirigibles from outside of the united states used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable.  in likes of what had happened to the german airship hindenburg, officials didn't want a similar disaster to occur in downtown new york. also, the dirigibles light mass would make it a target to high, forceful winds.  the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currets.  this reality caused fear that a zeppelin could potentially be blown into a spire of some sort on another building, causing it to suffer a hole in its fragile lining. the law also caused obstacles for docking dirigibles on the empire state building  ... dirigibles could not more at the empire state building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas.  this law thwarted many of the would-be attempts of mooring these. mooring dirigibles was a dream talked about in,  the mooring mast,  however that soon never had the chance to come true.
1.0 although constructing a mooring mast on the top of the empire state building seemed like a good idea, a number of obstacles prevented this theory from becoming reality. the builders and architects had to change the frame of the building completely to accommodate the weight of the mast, and this costed over sixty thousand dollars. another problem was that most dirigibles outside the @location use hydrogen over helium, which was very flammable, and if a dirigible suffered the same fate as the hindenburg, it would cause a much greater accident at ground level. the greatest challenge that the mast faced was constanly shifting winds from violent air currents. this caused the back of the ship swivel around the mast, even when tied to it, which caused a problem. most importantly there was already an existing law that prevented dirigibles from flying too low over urban areas, so it would be illegal for the dirigible to approach the building, let alone tie up to it. although the mooring mast at the top of the empire state building seemed like a good idea, this feat couldn't be accomplished due to the obstacles.
0.5 in this excerpt the builders of the empire state building were faced with many problem's trying to build a dock for dirigibles. the first problem they were faced with was how could they put this much stress on the building's structure, as mentioned in paragraph @num. another problem the workers faced was the safety of the city people below. what if the dirigible caught on fire like the hindenburg and all the pedestrians below would be in danger. also the building around it would in harms way too. as stated in paragraph @num the dock was never really ment for use. i think they just wanted a reason to make the building taller than the chrysler building.
1.0 in  the mooring mast  by @organization, the builders of the empire state building faced obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock on it. these obstacles took precaution of safety, nature itself, and the law. the first obstacle was one of safety.  most dirigibles from outside of the united states use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable.  owners of the empire state building realized that if a dirigible was destroyed by fire, it would cause a huge accident. also, this accident would be devastating because it'd take place over the densely populated area of downtown new york. in addition,  the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents.  these would cause the back of the ship to swivel around the mooring mast. dirigibles that are moored in open fields use weights to be weighed down. yet, these can't be used on top of the empire state building because they'd be dangling about walking pedestrians which is dangerous. lastly, a major obstacle faced when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the building was the  existing law against airships to fly too low over urban areas.  @caps, this would make it illegal for a ship to tie to the building or even approach the area. overall, the obstacles faced when trying to allow dirigibles to dock on the empire state building lead to the disappearance of this idea altogether.
0.0 technology was not caught up to the dirigibles. they could not dock because neither the building nor the dirigible had the righ equipment and that was one of the obstacle that the builders of the empire state building faced. for @caps: when they have to delivery the newspaper.
